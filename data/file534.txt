5340176 according to the foreign ministry israel is within its rights to use force against the seafarers a position paper by the foreign ministrys legal department says israel has the right to use force against the demonstrators as part of the oslo accords the foreign ministrys paper means that security forces could detain the vessels upon entry to gazas territorial waters arrest the passengers and haul the ship to israel where the detainees could be interrogated
5340177 the oslo accords expired in 1999 but even when they were in place they never advocated or allowed israel to use deadly force against nonviolent human rights workers however israel has decided to interpret the now defunct accords as giving them permission to act violently against us given this situation we the members of the free gaza movement would like to make two things very clear to the government of israel 1 we are nonviolent human rights activists and we have vowed to take no violent action in either word or deed against any other human beings including against israeli government and military officials who apparently wish us harm 2 the threats and intimidation that we have received these past few days though disturbing do not even come close to the suffering imposed on 1 4 million palestinians through the illegal and immoral israeli blockade of the gaza strip given the enormity of this crisis we will not be deterred we will sail to gaza and this siege will be lifted
5340178 the self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
5340179 the crimes against palestinians in the occupied territories and elsewhere are so shocking that the only emotionally valid reaction is rage and a call for extreme action but that does not help the victims and is likely to harm them
5340180 if we break the siege we win and even if they arrest us we win because this will expose the face of the occupation and prove israel is still an occupier in gaza
5340181 to persist with such an approach under present circumstances is indeed genocidal and risks destroying an entire palestinian community that is an integral part of an ethnic whole

5340204 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

5340216 there you are simple as that ive just made our first non political video
5340217 some things are obviously alright factual footage documentaries recordings of live events but i think some things should still be off limits for instance if you made a political commercial so that its purely made up material partisan stuff footage distorted to create a slanted impression
5340218 the overall thrust of all these changes is to liberalise our society to widen space for expression and participation we encourage more citizens to engage in debate to participate in building our shared future
5340219 we will progressively open up our system even more if you compare today with 5 years ago 10 years ago its much more open today

5340222 we look at strong markets such as russia eastern europe and central asia in each of these markets we are very close to the market

5340224 coffee price has increased a lot since last year i think by more than 100 per cent now there are a few ways we can defer all this
5340225 first we will try to improve our production and efficiency and try to look for cheaper labour that is the reason why we have shifted our plant from singapore to malaysia
5340226 the second way is to increase our selling price but consumers might not be able to accept this even the retailer might give us a lot of problems if we increase our selling price
5340227 but that is something we have to face its a challenge as we increase the price and at the same time we do some promotion activities that will ease the immediate impact of the price hike
5340228 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs

5340233 making a sequel to a game is always tougher especially given the arms race were seeing in videogames development
5340234 games do not compete in fun experiences they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
5340235 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5340236 as much as we dont want to play the game call of duty has this many guns and this has this many guns and how many will you have you cant escape that comparison when you do a sequel everyone expects more from a sequel you have to
5340237 were not scared to death that were not going to make a game that is really really better than gears of war 1 i know its prettier i know its faster i know its more fun i know its likely to be longer and still im worried that were not going to get the review scores that we did for the first one because everyone has these increased expectations at least we decided we werent going to compete in size with ourselves well compete with other really new experiences
5340238 unfortunately this was the thing we were shouting from the rooftops so we didnt listen to ourselves saying we were taking our last game and going to make it bigger and better we set ourselves up for quite a challenge of course we succeeded
5340239 were big fans of gamesindustry biz by some measure its the best games trade site out there and im including the us ones too its a true must read site and several times a day at that the team have done a great job building it to such a position of strength

5340298 its practically impossible to be a decent consumer and have a normal thought process when youre staring at a steaming hot piece of pizza
5340299 i said no way im not going for that it was ridiculous

5340336 russia will start a withdrawal of its military contingent from georgia reinforcing peacekeepers in the zone of the georgian south ossetian conflict
5340337 the two heads of state agreed to continue regular contacts
5340338 accused russia of stalling its military pullback in georgia but the bush administration is not rushing to repudiate moscow for its actions
5340339 is struggling to figure out the best way to penalize russia it doesnt want to deeply damage existing cooperation on many fronts or discourage moscow from further integrating itself into global economic and political institutions at the same time u s officials say russia cant be allowed to get away with invading its neighbor
5340340 to talk with nato allies about what message the west should send to russia
5340341 russia cant use disproportionate force against its neighbor and still be welcomed into the halls of international institutions rice said
5340342 neither rice nor u s defense secretary robert gates would be specific about what punitive actions the u s or the international community might take
5340343 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5340344 powerful voices in russia have been calling for the restoration of the soviet union
5340345 russian prime minister and former president vladimir putins short sharp lesson to challenging former soviet state has unleashed patriotic pride in russia and nostalgia for the glory days of the soviet union the kremlins brutal message to its former satellite states and the west that its great power interests cannot be ignored has delighted russias nationalist masses a new found confidence is generating its own momentum with calls for the restoration of the soviet union recognizing that the message has hit a nerve yevgeny fedorov the influential chairman of the russian dumas parliament political economy house committee has given weight to the pressure groups backing the initiative
5340346 the forces behind ukraines orange revolution and georgias rose revolution

5340348 russia must seek allies within the cis with a view to re establishing the concept of one nation different states
5340349 recently a secret conference sponsored by the kremlin took place in sukhumi abkhazia georgias other breakaway region
5340350 at the end of a tumultuous nine days there was deep uncertainty about what may unfold next in the war in which russian warplanes had bombed a european ally of the u s and revived the specter of the most tense days of the cold war washington was still struggling to find an effective response to what it had condemn ed as blatant russian aggression moscow however takes exactly the opposite view and is exploiting the wests discomfort to the hilt it has seized the opportunity presented by the georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ill judged attack on the breakaway province of south ossetia to show that russia will no longer tolerate nato and western encroachment on its sphere of influence it rammed home that message last week by warning that poland had placed itself at risk of attack even nuclear attack by agreeing to the installation of part of a u s anti missile defense system within polish territory a plan that has long infuriated the kremlin
5340351 caught by surprise both by the georgian action and the scale of the russian reaction
5340352 critics of u s handling of the crisis and events leading up to it divide into two camps those who believe the bush administration provoked russia by aligning itself too closely with georgia and those who believe it did not stand up to moscow strongly enough both camps agree however that the u s delivered mixed messages to georgia by cautioning it against military action in private while championing its cause in public and that washington failed to pay sufficient attention to the brewing crisis
5340353 blaming the bush administrations preoccupation with the middle east and terrorism
5340354 the fact that they could hire a woman with such a deplorable record is in keeping with dhs pattern of incompetence overall

5340358 both of us were hoping that that was just the way they put it up there

5340361 there is no better story to tell than that of a homegrown hoosier company that continues to grow and create new jobs
5340362 were committed to creating the best business environment we can so these 50 companies to watch and all the businesses across our state continue to succeed in todays global economy

5340366 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5340367 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5340368 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5340373 weve completed the suite of ways in which people can communicate with each other using an iphone adding voice text based and picture instant messaging to the standard phone call sms and e mail functionality of the phone this functionality really adds value to the already terrific iphone experience

5340375 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support
5340376 that sort of lock in is a 20th century business model and it doesnt wash with savvy mobile users today
5340377 about double what we are spending today on child incentives
5340378 this package will make a difference to many couples but i cant guarantee that it will solve our problem because it is a deep problem
5340379 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5340380 its humbling for me and for kobe 1 8bryant3 8 it was unbelievable especially for myself
5340381 going against greece and spain those were easy to get up for this game it might have been easy to come out and have a game where afterward we make excuses but we didnt take a step back and it felt good we got better today and that was a good thing
5340382 were a good team getting back to square one but its still getting back to square one for the medal round
5340383 were still nervous riding on it for the thousandth time
5340384 so you can only imagine what the spectators are going to feel when they see us go eight riders deep going 40 miles an hour bumping all over the place its a scary feeling
5340385 a lot of people are drawing parallels to the impact that snowboarding has had on the winter games
5340386 it translates to tv very easily its exciting theres a lot of drama there can be crashes
5340387 we worked very closely to get the event slotted in the right way we worked very closely with nbc
5340388 its actually a contact sport were not going to call any fouls if you use your elbows a little bit on the turns
5340389 there could be some violent crashes for sure because they go very fast
5340390 these guys are truly athletes i mean it used to be a bunch of kids on bicycles having a good time but now its really kind of moved into a whole new hemisphere as far as the athletics involved
5340391 the course on tv looks really intimidating so i hope that doesnt put people off

5340394 it is in violation of chinas law on demonstrations and protests
5340395 because the problems those applicants contended for were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5340396 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
5340397 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
5340398 in regard to the three protest parks no interviews and coverage is allowed
5340399 the so called beijing olympic protest zones are in fact a cynical exercise by the chinese government to appear to be meeting the standards of previous olympic cities for matters such as public protests and media and internet freedom while in fact the authorities are actively undermining those rights to ensure a veneer of stability and harmony during the games

5340448 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5340449 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5340450 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5340451 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5340452 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5340453 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5340454 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5340455 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5340456 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5340457 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5340458 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

5340461 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5340462 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5340463 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5340464 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5340465 if i am elected president they will have that support
5340466 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5340467 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5340468 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged i believe the va should always be there to provide top quality care for our veterans and i believe the va should continue to provide broad spectrum health care to eligible veterans in addition to specialized care
5340469 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5340470 this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill
5340471 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5340472 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5340473 our veterans administration is not equipped to care for the wounded as a result of this long war
5340474 im going to give every veteran a plastic card that needs a routine health care need and say take this plastic card to a health care provider or a doctor of your choice
5340475 illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with low incomes
5340476 theres gonna be large numbers of people who are afflicted unfortunately with ptsd and i believe we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine healthcare
5340477 put more of our assets in treating the unique capabilities of the va for the treatment of combat wounds as you described them both seen and unseen that means a veteran with a routine healthcare need rather than go down to the va and stand in line to stand in line to get an appointment to get an appointment should be given a plastic card and say if you have a routine healthcare need take it wherever you want to whatever doctor or healthcare provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care and our love on these grievous wounds of war both seen and unseen
5340478 it happened in the county which is their jurisdiction and involved a motor vehicle and an injury

5340489 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5340490 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5340491 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5340492 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5340493 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5340494 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5340495 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5340496 marketing had been considered a support function at wal mart
5340497 i had to convince people that it could have a direct impact on sales
5340498 travel is a category extremely suited to the internet due to its ability to provide efficient access to an extremely wide range of comparable information whilst certain areas of the travel industry were initially slow to utilize the benefits of the internet it is now one of the undoubted success stories of online playing an integral part in the arrangements and experience of todays traveler
5340499 when i first started in the industry all your advertising and your lead generation would be done through newspapers and magazines travel amp leisure outside magazine the new york times
5340500 and youd spend a lot of money to advertise in those magazines to get a very low return
5340501 you can spend significantly less and get a whole lot more eyeballs looking at your web site and hopefully ones that are interested in doing your kinds of trips
5340502 when we first launched our site in 1998 our net was rather wide
5340503 and because of that we got a lot of fish in the net that really werent qualified to do our trips for example we would get people getting married and planning a honeymoon and older people without kids so over the years what weve done is refine the site through pictures and the wording as a result the number of visitors continues to go up but the number of leads hasnt that substantially but were getting more qualified leads
5340504 we really wanted our web site to be easy to navigate and clean so people who come to the site are able to quickly find what theyre looking for
5340505 for a big ticket item like a bicycle trip people really want to talk to a person before they book
5340506 you can fill out a reservation or request form online but nobody that i know of is doing online bookings in high end adventure travel

5340526 aapl and rimm are both pushing all of the other manufactures to the sidelines its clear that rimms blackberry is the dominating force in the corporate smartphone market but the apple iphone has shaken things up quite a bit on the consumer side
5340527 the combination of the new apple model flying off the shelves and rumors of a postponement for one of rimms new releases has raised questions among some analysts as to rimms ability to fight back
5340528 research in motion may be planning to release several new smartphones this year including the kickstart the thunder and the already announced bold
5340529 they will each likely contain blackberrys hallmark features such as push e mail camera gps and wi fi as well as features unique to the specific models while the apple iphone has captured the hearts and minds of its user base so has research in motions blackberry
5340530 in terms of winners the global consumer and enterprise smartphone markets are big enough to support both apple and research in motion its the other cell phone manufacturers that look like the real losers
5340531 it appears aapl and rimm are on a collision course in the consumer market as rim gears up for its counterattack against the iphone but by owning both of these smartphone kingpins well be sitting pretty as these two companies duke it out
5340532 so if you havent already staked a claim in these smartphone dominators or want to add to your position the time is now
5340533 the city attorneys letter to the petitioner responding to her request for public records is bereft of any indications of due diligence or understanding of the applicable law
5340534 theres nobody thats more liberal about complying with the public records act than me
5340535 judge oberholtzers decision on friday revealed that mr aguirre either does not understand the public records act or intentionally refused to obey the law
5340536 the records act is very basic law for anyone in public law
5340537 the fact that there was such a blatant violation and that this went on for nearly a year raises serious questions about either competence or intent
5340538 the people have a right to know what was discussed and what occurred in the city attorneys office that lead to this violation of california law over the course of nearly a year
5340539 if i knew i would have recruited a little differently
5340540 ive watched duke i talked to michigan state coach tom izzo who went small when he went to the final four in 2005

5340542 its going to make it harder for teams to guard us both they have to pick their poison because we both do some things well
5340543 the one thing that has stood out with the teams ive watched is their toughness

5340548 we are looking into the credit needs of farmers we cannot have a situation where 80 of this sector is outside the formal financial system and suffers from excessive indebtedness we are trying to resolve this problem i hope this would be done soon
5340549 we cannot minimise the importance of this sector for our economy and our polity
5340550 we are looking at ways of having a quantum jump in investment in irrigation
5340551 demonstrates our commitment to reversing the unfortunate trend we saw between the mid 1990s and the mid 2000s of decline in investment in agriculture and a shift of the terms of trade away from agriculture
5340552 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5340553 this is the largest financing of its kind ever completed and the fact that a landmark transaction of this size and complexity has been completed in challenging credit markets is a testament to the strength of the business and the confidence of the financial markets in baa and its airports
5340554 made its first foray into presidential politics with the presciently named indecision 2000 and the difference in the shows approach to its coverage then and now provides a tongue in cheek measure of the shows striking evolution
5340555 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
5340556 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
5340557 you all the news stories first before its even true
5340558 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5340559 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5340560 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5340561 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5340562 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable
5340563 most agitated feelings about torture in a way that is not to be too cute that is not torture to listen to and that is not purely strident
5340564 the rubber face theres only so many ways you can stare incredulously at the camera and tilt an eyebrow but thats your old standby what would
5340565 the absurdity of what you imagine to be the dark heart of conspiracy theorists wet dreams far too frequently turns out to be true
5340566 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5340567 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5340568 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
5340569 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt
5340570 to name things that dont seem to have a name
5340571 named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
5340572 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
5340573 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels
5340574 all these data points of spin and transparent falsehoods dished out in the form of political discourse
5340575 fish from that what is the true meaning what are red herrings false leads
5340576 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5340577 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5340578 for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess there is in our hearts so we can move on to the business of making you laugh
5340579 sit in the back of the country and make wisecracks
5340580 the process of the show is to bury those feelings as subtext and that was a real moment of text its laying bare the type of thing that is there hopefully to inform the show but the show is usually an exercise in hiding that
5340581 whats nice to us about the relentlessness of the show
5340582 is you know youre going to get that release no matter what every night monday through thursday like pizza it may not be the best pizza youve ever had but its still pizza man and you get to have it every night its a wonderful feeling to have this toxin in your body in the morning that little cup of sadness and feel by 7 or 7 30 that night youve released it in sweat equity and can move on to the next day
5340583 the federal communications commission will have the final say in the battle between the broadcasters which fear interference on the airwaves theyll still be using and the companies including mot that want to share the television airwaves
5340584 its a very gratifying day for the bats team and an important moment for the marketplace as a whole
5340585 as we have stressed repeatedly our motivation to become an exchange has come from our desire to participate directly in the national market system and compete on a level playing field with our primary competitors nasdaq and the new york stock exchange

5340668 theres a pressure among retailers to constantly give consumers something new consumers are now very sophisticated and trend aware especially because h amp m and forever 21 have made trend surfing accessible to everyone fast fashion brands are able to pinpoint up and coming trends and react very quickly to them theres a higher expectation for small retailers to keep up with all the options
5340669 although most major labels and european brands still stick to a twice yearly schedule many emerging designers especially in the us are now sending deliveries every few months a lot of buyers are starting to move toward a one to three month schedule and are buying less since its hard to commit to large orders when you dont know where the season is going to take you
5340670 the triumph of micro trends over all encompassing seasonal trends has more to do with delivery schedules than anything else the two season system is essentially defunct as designers are pressed to keep consumers stimulated with new goods in that sense there isnt room for an overarching vision because the schedule has accelerated so dramatically
5340671 online retail allows for a quick turnaround and access to collections as they arrive
5340672 customers who dont live near a major city can still have access to the seasons must have pieces and most desirable brands many customers even cyber stalk their favorite online stores to be the first to buy the weeks newest pieces

5340677 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition

5340764 ahima is also hopeful that cms can digest the responses to the proposed rule and promptly issue final rules in order for the health care industry to at long last get icd 10 implementation rolling
5340765 we recognize that the transition to icd 10 will require some upfront costs but each year of delay would create additional costs both because of the limitations of icd 9 and because of the need to employ the greater precision that icd 10 codes provide to support value based purchasing of health care and other initiatives

5340786 an earnings claim is an opportunity to showcase your company it provides instant credibility with a candidate because you have one

5340850 i love to watch michael phelps when he swims in the wa wa
5340851 made its first foray into presidential politics with the presciently named indecision 2000 and the difference in the shows approach to its coverage then and now provides a tongue in cheek measure of the shows striking evolution
5340852 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
5340853 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
5340854 you all the news stories first before its even true
5340855 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5340856 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5340857 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5340858 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5340859 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable
5340860 most agitated feelings about torture in a way that is not to be too cute that is not torture to listen to and that is not purely strident
5340861 the rubber face theres only so many ways you can stare incredulously at the camera and tilt an eyebrow but thats your old standby what would
5340862 the absurdity of what you imagine to be the dark heart of conspiracy theorists wet dreams far too frequently turns out to be true
5340863 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5340864 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5340865 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
5340866 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt
5340867 to name things that dont seem to have a name
5340868 named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
5340869 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
5340870 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels
5340871 all these data points of spin and transparent falsehoods dished out in the form of political discourse
5340872 fish from that what is the true meaning what are red herrings false leads
5340873 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5340874 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5340875 for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess there is in our hearts so we can move on to the business of making you laugh
5340876 sit in the back of the country and make wisecracks
5340877 the process of the show is to bury those feelings as subtext and that was a real moment of text its laying bare the type of thing that is there hopefully to inform the show but the show is usually an exercise in hiding that
5340878 whats nice to us about the relentlessness of the show
5340879 is you know youre going to get that release no matter what every night monday through thursday like pizza it may not be the best pizza youve ever had but its still pizza man and you get to have it every night its a wonderful feeling to have this toxin in your body in the morning that little cup of sadness and feel by 7 or 7 30 that night youve released it in sweat equity and can move on to the next day
5340880 i honestly was in shock when i saw that we got the same scores and my name was in second it was weird i guess they liked her routine better
5340881 i hope they the judges know what they are doing i dont think there is any way to protest in this competition
5340882 i tied in my olympic games there were people that tied back when i was competing but i guess they dont want it now
5340883 i dont know exactly why i won i think this is special rules for judges i dont know whats different im only a gymnast i must do the jump two times
5340884 i was nervous but i have prepared psychologically and i believed i had the ability to win this is the highest individual honour for me and i waited for a long time
5340885 we are disappointed but china played very well in the tournament and are a very good team
5340886 the defenders relaxed after 2 0 and australia is a team that exploits a weakness quickly i am happy we managed a draw
5340887 what do we put in the place of such beaurocracies gone afoul to manage something as important and expensive as our national defense
5340888 my job is to attend to the secular needs of the population yours is to the spiritual needs i dont tell you how to do you job and i dont expect you to tell me how to do mine my specific belief system must remain private if im to serve all the people fairly
5340889 carrying out gods mission in the 21st century the relationship between polity and theology
5340890 after a brief elevator pitch on fast app delivery centralization security and minimizing the need to install apps etc
5340891 if its so great why doesnt every company do this
5340892 sometimes followed by why is citrix only a 1 5 billion company why not a lot more
5340893 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5340894 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5340895 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5340896 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5340897 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5340898 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5340899 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5340900 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5340901 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5340902 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5340903 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5340904 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5340905 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5340906 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5340907 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5340908 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5340909 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5340910 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5340911 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
5340912 the last lines crc didnt work or is otherwise bad give it to me again
5340913 i am over 40 years old i cant run around or insert sport here like those younger folks do
5340914 are young guys going to want to dress like them im not so sure i think gender alone will be somewhat of a challenge
5340915 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5340916 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5340917 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5340918 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5340919 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5340920 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5340921 to some degree these people can be role models in terms of showing our current students that they have a lot of opportunities to advance
5340922 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5340923 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5340924 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5340925 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5340926 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5340927 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5340928 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5340929 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5340930 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5340931 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5340932 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5340933 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5340934 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
5340935 this time all belgian and french kinepolis screens will show the entire met season that runs from october through may 2009
5340936 eureka listened to pet owners and came up with features that gently but thoroughly remove stubborn pet hair and odor from the entire home
5340937 the optima pet lover is a lightweight convenient pet mess solution that wont compromise the quality of clean that pet owners need while giving them more time to play with their pets
5340938 attachments typically account for as much as 85 of total email volume 45 of those attachments are larger than 10 mb
5340939 email storage is rapidly becoming the single most important vector in the growth of data retention for organizations worldwide often representing up to 10 of annual it spending
5340940 every additional tb of storage an organisation purchases will cost 3 times that amount to manage
5340941 by offering an intelligent way to handle the ever growing flow of email attachments the m guardian securestore helps organizations to significantly reduce these costs and manage data more efficiently
5340942 one of the biggest problems with email is the massive storage requirements of multiple copies of attachments
5340943 m guardian with caringos castor provides customers an email solution that dramatically reduces storage requirements for attachments with an affordable scalable best in class content storage repository complexity to archive and store an ever increasing volume of email and attachments is now a thing of the past
5340944 there is an urgency for youth to get involved with these things now more than ever to get involved and dedicate themselves to world issues to try to change the world
5340945 everyone brought welcome knowledge that was overwhelmingly encouraging and very informative
5340946 by yourself i find its hard to change but in a group you can come together and make one great event
5340947 he was a genuine american original and he will be missed by his friends which has to be about a million people
5340948 and by the time they left they were best friends
5340949 once jack starts to tell a story its hard to get him to stop
5340950 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
5340951 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
5340952 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5340953 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
5340954 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
5340955 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
5340956 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all
5340957 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5340958 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5340959 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5340960 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5340961 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5340962 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5340963 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5340964 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5340965 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5340966 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5340967 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5340968 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5340969 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5340970 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5340971 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5340973 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
5340974 this is the only thing that has seen more parties than us
5340975 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5340976 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5340977 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5340978 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5340979 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5340980 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5340981 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5340982 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5340983 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5340984 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5340985 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5340986 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5340987 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5340988 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5340989 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5340990 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5340991 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5340992 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5340993 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5340994 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5340995 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5340996 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5340997 the vast majority of house candidates in competitive races ran as iraq war critics
5340998 the conservative saddleback crowd was not going to be on his side
5340999 the number of questions will depend on how succinct the senator is
5341000 here is a security question i didnt get to with senator obama we didnt have enough time
5341001 tell me in a minute why you want to be president
5341002 on saturday night it did not compare well with mccain who was decisive passionate and surprisingly personal
5341003 assiduously avoided the underlying issue of growing energy demand driven by immigration fueled population growth
5341004 indy greens started the presidential petition drive on january 1 2008 in independence virginia
5341005 eight months 15 days later the cake is baked the deed is done were happy hillbillies since jan 1st indy greens collected 70 000 petition signatures seven successful petition drives to put five candidates on the ballot for u s house and 2 state wide petition drives and now michael bloomberg on ballot for president we made a promise to mr bloomberg and now we have kept that promise
5341006 if it is an issue that a candidate is put forth we assume that the internal communications have happened but if we were to receive a letter from mayor bloomberg that he doesnt want his name on the ballot we would have to look into the matter to see why the nominee for a party doesnt want to be that nominee
5341007 it is a free country and if chooses to not have his name on the ballot he has every right to do so
5341008 yes bloomberg must consent to this and it will be up to the board of elections
5341009 but we made a promise and we wanted to keep it and we have
5341010 they did it all without the mayors knowledge or consent
5341011 i freely admit that i was not aware of just how good a two way forward hossa was
5341012 i can dangle four guys at once but i cant put a freakin tie on
5341013 hockey belongs to the cartoon network where a person can be pancaked by an acme anvil then expanded accordion style back to full stature without any lasting side effect
5341014 funny if youve just finished a beer bong in record time
5341015 thats the stupidest idea ever crosby doesnt want to be followed 24 7 by cameramen and thats all hed get if he dated someone like her
5341016 io sono contro la violenza da qualunque parte provenga bisogna sottolineare come la repressione cinese abbia portato il mio popolo a un punto di non ritorno
5341017 i cinesi hanno usato la scusa delle olimpiadi per imporre un ulteriore giro di vite in luglio ci sono state esecuzioni capitali di attivisti alle quali sono stati costretti ad assistere migliaia di persone il regime del terrore a decine vengono arrestati torturati incarcerati ci accusano di essere legati ai gruppi fondamentalisti solo perch siamo musulmani da anni ci tolgono tutto la libert di criticare la politica del governo di pechino le nostre case e i nostri posti di lavoro che vengono dati ai cinesi fatti immigrare nella nostra regione le nostre risorse il gas e il petrolio prese e dirottate verso le altre zone della cina e anche la nostra giovent i maschi lasciati l senza speranza le donne tra i 15 e i 25 anni deportate lontane dalla nostra terra
5341018 non potevo vivere in un posto dove noi sembravamo dei marziani rispetto a buona parte del resto del mondo laddove esiste la democrazia e non la dittatura i diritti umani vengono rispettati e non calpestati potevo fare altrimenti visto la sofferenza a cui siamo sottoposti limportante che venga compreso che il mio impegno per gli uiguri la lotta di un essere umano insieme e a favore di altri essere umani

5341023 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5341024 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5341025 the f 22 team remains absolutely dedicated to the objective to deliver 339 production aircraft to the warfighters at an affordable cost
5341026 gaos reviews of weapons over three decades have found consistent cost increases schedule delays and performance shortfalls the nations growing long range fiscal challenges may ultimately spur congress to cut spending on new weapons and to redirect funding to other priorities in response dod might be compelled to deliver new weapons and to redirect funding to other priorities
5341027 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5341028 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5341029 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5341030 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5341031 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5341032 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5341033 get it off the air and i really mean it
5341034 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5341035 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5341036 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5341037 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5341038 i am married to the next president of the united states
5341039 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5341040 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5341041 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5341042 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5341043 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5341044 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5341045 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5341046 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5341047 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5341048 may had to have a banana every morning and this banana absolutely could not have a bruise on it one morning i watched her peel seven bananas in a row before she found one without a bad place she kept tons of bananas around the kitchen stoneware bowls chock full next to honey they were the most plentiful thing in the house may could go through five or more every morning looking for the ideal flawless banana the one that hadnt gotten banged up by the grocery world rosaleen made banana pudding banana cream pie banana jell o and banana slices on lettuce leaf till august told her it was all right just throw the blooming things away
5341049 see this useless thug off the threads and back in his cave where he belongs
5341050 is that fred is that wiz is that sp is that black power is that that guy should i pull my pistol and shoot first and then look for id there are 3 more of them across the street do i need to reload and fire 101 shots do i have enough ammo can i trust those black cops who are my fellow officers this is nyc im white they cant do this to me can they
5341051 see this useless thug off the threads and back in his cave where he belongs
5341052 is that fred is that wiz is that sp is that black power is that that guy should i pull my pistol and shoot first and then look for id there are 3 more of them across the street do i need to reload and fire 101 shots do i have enough ammo can i trust those black cops who are my fellow officers this is nyc im white they cant do this to me can they
5341053 duhhhhhh derrrrrr um yeah ill take 10 00 in ass errr gas
5341054 we do not teach that in china or in the u s
5341055 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5341056 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5341057 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5341058 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5341059 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5341060 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5341061 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5341062 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5341063 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5341064 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5341065 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5341066 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5341067 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5341068 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5341069 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5341070 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5341071 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5341072 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5341073 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5341074 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5341075 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5341076 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5341077 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5341078 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5341079 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5341080 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5341081 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5341082 loved everything from the salmon and spring rolls to the grilled avocado sandwich everything is fresh and from scratch the owner chef is always
5341083 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5341084 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5341085 in fact she even got a better deal she is now in a better school and one that is nearer to her house
5341086 this should not be the case does it mean that students should keep quiet no matter what a teacher does
5341087 eine feng shui analyse muss doch ein eindeutiges ergebnis liefern
5341088 es kann doch nicht sein dass ein raum positiv und gleichzeitig negativ auf jemanden wirkt
5341089 da kann man sich doch raussuchen was man gerade braucht
5341090 but i believe hes a really good person i hope hell win i think he will if he doesnt you can kiss the democratic party goodbye
5341091 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
5341092 a subsidiary of the north american islamic trust which is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia
5341093 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5341094 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5341095 we are being told the anti missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist doesnt it seem funny to you to say the least
5341096 two weeks later they still have not been found the question is where is saddam hussein where are those weapons of mass destruction if they were ever in existence is saddam hussein in a bunker sitting on cases containing weapons of mass destruction preparing to blow the whole place up
5341097 who must be crushed in the name of democracy and decency and against whom all the resources of the west must be mobilized until a new enemy is found
5341098 what is troubling is the u s medias willingness to similarly toe the party line but in the absence of any of the coercive measures such as the state censorship that the russian press endures
5341099 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5341100 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5341101 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5341102 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5341103 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5341104 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5341105 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5341106 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5341107 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5341108 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5341109 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5341110 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5341111 okay how is this going to benefit me what will i get out of this
5341112 i heard the crowd obviously we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
5341113 i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
5341114 from a personal point of view it is disappointing but we have to concentrate on kaunas and not rangers
5341115 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes
5341116 chelsea hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them the confidence together sometimes that is the key
5341117 i have not spoken to any media so its frustrating to read quotes that i have supposedly said about my future
5341118 i think that some people are just trying to make mischief but my intentions are very clear
5341119 i am happy here at arsenal my future is with arsenal and the priority is to achieve success and win trophies at arsenal
5341120 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourselves in the house of god which is the church of god the pillar stylos and ground of the truth
5341121 it appears that they mnea had a considerable amount of influence it unnerves me to think that they may have a hand in determining who the principals are because i think thats clearly a management decision
5341122 any time youre in management its a very fine line between the respect and the like
5341123 i think one of the most beneficial results for children would be a beneficial relationship with the mnea
5341124 weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
5341125 it makes me wonder if its just like theyre unbeatable so why waste my time
5341126 youre putting funds together youre putting time into this and if youre able to pull 40 percent youre feeling pretty good thats a little discouraging
5341127 perhaps in stalinist russia it is a good thing here in america where we are supposed to have democracy and choice the decade long streak of lee running unchallenged on his performance in the assembly was an abomination
5341128 this state would function just fine with fewer people in the general assembly
5341129 so you have no problem with citizens in that district having no choice even though a full 30 to 40 of them do not vote for lee
5341130 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5341131 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
5341132 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
5341133 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
5341134 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5341135 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5341136 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5341137 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5341138 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5341139 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5341140 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5341141 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5341142 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5341143 in meeting with both finance staff members and financial aid administrators it became apparent that the college needed to invest institutional resources in the purchase of a system that would enable the college to disburse student refunds electronically
5341144 the current system of manually printing checks was very cumbersome costly in terms of both supplies and labor hours and most importantly not very convenient to our students who needed immediate access to funds to pay for necessary school supplies books and living expenses
5341145 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5341146 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5341147 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5341148 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5341149 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5341150 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5341151 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5341152 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5341153 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5341154 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5341155 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5341156 when i took over nine years ago this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state on the verge of becoming a failed state
5341157 the challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in pakistans history yet have i met those challenges
5341158 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5341159 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5341160 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5341161 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first

5341164 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5341165 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
5341166 condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5341167 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5341168 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
5341169 these pictures represent me my cocker spaniel rupert tamaqua hometown the coal region town where i am from and my love of the penguins and my future husband geno
5341170 my entire room is covered in pens pictures so it was hard to find a good place to take the pic
5341171 i didnt have a canadian flag but i had pants hopefully it works
5341172 we took a picture in front of our brand new high school which is the newest in connecticut and in front of the terryville fair sign the terryville fair is the biggest event all year and we thought that maybe that would be a good picture
5341173 the first pic is my two brothers andrew and adam and my penguins stuff
5341174 yall know everythings bigger in texas and im the biggest sidney crosby fan
5341175 im me as in jordan the one on the right and we are from queensbury ny
5341176 my sister and i on main street u s a in the magic kingdom at walt disney world thats cinderellas castle behind us
5341177 my siblings and i with mickey this was at chef mickeys a restaurant inside the contemporary resort at walt disney world which explains mickeys attire
5341178 i took my penguins pride all the way to virginia beach with me
5341179 you may be fast ricky bobby but i am ali said
5341180 whoa this young guy is our goalie and hes french
5341181 were very disappointed for a country saying theyre opening up and things are getting better it sure doesnt seem like it
5341182 the chinese christians have been asking us for bibles saying they are desperate for bibles
5341183 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5341184 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5341185 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5341186 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support
5341187 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5341188 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5341189 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5341190 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5341191 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5341192 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5341193 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5341194 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5341195 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5341196 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5341197 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5341198 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5341199 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5341200 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5341201 einverst ndniserkl rung best tigung 1 ich verzichte auf sonderleistungen jeglicher art tarifvertr ge finden keine anwendung eine bisher gehandhabte betriebliche bung eingeschlossen
5341202 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5341203 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5341204 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5341205 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5341206 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5341207 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5341208 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5341209 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5341210 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5341211 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5341212 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5341213 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5341214 se ha hecho mayor y es esc ptico respecto a su existencia
5341215 es un tint n m s maduro actual y moderno ha crecido y ha mantenido relaciones sexuales
5341216 la ausencia del paso del tiempo tint n siempre es adolescente y la abolici n de la presencia femenina en sus peripecias nunca hay mujeres excepto la castafiore
5341217 ya no es el h roe luminoso y solar de su juventud es crepuscular ha sufrido derrotas y ve que las cosas son dif ciles
5341218 es como si hubiera aterrizado en una realidad m s dura en la que no triunfan los ideales de su juventud sino el dinero
5341219 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5341220 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5341221 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5341222 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5341223 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5341224 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5341225 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5341226 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5341227 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5341228 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5341229 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5341230 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5341231 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5341232 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5341233 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5341234 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5341235 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5341236 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5341237 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5341238 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5341239 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5341240 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5341241 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5341242 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5341243 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5341244 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5341245 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5341246 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5341247 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5341248 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5341249 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5341250 se puso en marcha en 2004 con una inversi n de 12 millones de euros para ejecutar en cinco a os
5341251 hemos tenido un gran incendio el de castej n de valdejasa y el de zuera que afortunadamente lo hemos logrado extinguir sin que haya quemado m s superficie que las 1 500 hect reas

5341254 yo me alegro mucho de que el presidente lo haya recogido en sus declaraciones ya que el departamento de medio ambiente tiene muchos planes relacionados con las obras p blicas como el plan de depuraci n
5341255 garantizar la reserva de 6 550 hect metros c bicos que figura en nuestro estatuto de autonom a y que se incorporen las bases de la pol tica del agua aprobadas por las cortes a los planes de cuenca de las tres cuencas en las que estamos
5341256 por el proceso de elaboraci n en el que existen riesgos de que arag n se encuentre en un debate dif cil con el resto de las comunidades aut nomas para garantizar que aquello que las leyes ya nos han contemplado se nos contemple ahora en el nuevo plan
5341257 these are so much fun to use you might let flies into your house on purpose
5341258 obama and the netroots looking a tad desperate these days
5341259 a faith that unites and never divides a faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity
5341260 that was a scary moment for all of us seeing your friend collapse like that is something that nobody wants to experience hes doing much better now and taking it easy on the bus
5341261 pas besoin dun plan de relance qui serait un plan de relance artificiel

5341278 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
5341279 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country

5341520 the canon hj40 opened up a window into a whole new world
5341521 this lens allowed me to get shots that would have been impossible otherwise the odell creek story is about wildlife but only a lens with this level of hdtv image clarity zoom range and image stabilization could allow us to fully capture what can be some highly elusive subjects especially the eagles and other bird species
5341522 i started recording what was going on when i realized that this was a much bigger and more complicated project than i had originally envisioned
5341523 theres a lot of wildlife out there but you just cant get close enough to photograph it we were lucky to have the canon hj40 without its telephoto capabilities and image stabilization we never would have been able to record what we did
5341524 there were two important aspects of this lens for shooting odell creek
5341525 number one is that its a very long lens capable of zooming in very tight number two is the built in stabilizer without a stabilizer in order to get a decent image on a long lens you need a heavy tripod a good camera head and an extremely stable platform but with canons built in stabilizer i was able to get on top of my truck which shakes in the wind zoom all the way in and like magic the shimmering stopped and i got rock solid images this makes it ideal for recording wildlife where youre in remote areas and you need to travel light the hj40 is light enough to be easily carried around in the field in addition the bracketry is solid and well designed including a sliding balance plate this made changing lenses in the field an easy task to accomplish
5341526 all the buttons are exactly where your fingers have to be its very well laid out canon really did think this through all of the controls are very intuitive and thats really important when youre outside its freezing cold and youre trying to capture hd video of an animal that youve been waiting all day to see
5341527 it can be a battle to record wildlife in a harsh environment but canon gave me everything i needed to capture these shots

5341554 a month after promising to quickly seek dredging proposals the rivanna water amp sewer authority revealed today that its letting the dredging process wait for guidance from a task force led by an adamant dredging opponent
5341555 the task force is to keep us from knowing the cost of dredging in time to make it part of our water supply
5341556 i did poll the individuals on the board and you all did agree
5341557 were using less and less and less for six years
5341558 but rivanna is actively planning for us all to be water hogs

5341561 the purpose of the public comment period is really to get the comments on the public record
5341562 there has been a dramatic increase in requests this organization takes the publics right to know very seriously
5341563 lounging by a pool in the hamptons in a leopard skin swimsuit with her flaxen hair gathered in bunches paris hilton this week gave her tart response to being dragged into the us presidential campaign by john mccain
5341564 im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5341565 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
5341566 i think it was a very wise response for someone not always associated with wisdom because she laughed at herself
5341567 pariss brand is about being hot and men and sex and fashion and fun she is a beautiful girl with a rockin body and that never hurts

5341572 i used to find her insufferable and representative of what i thought young women were being conditioned into to sexualise themselves and not rely on their brains now she just bores me

5341579 the maze of narrow alleys and dingy cobblestone streets that surrounds the red light district in hamburg germany has been attracting revellers for years
5341580 there was a time when real estate developers would not have considered building in an area with this kind of reputation
5341581 now we see more and more of them doing it and i really dont believe it will stop any time soon
5341582 its not at all surprising to see developers targeting these areas
5341583 particularly in older cities in europe and asia the red light district is where you often find many historic buildings and architectural landmarks and thats a very attractive selling point to builders and investors
5341584 home prices in the district have risen about 40 per cent in just the past year and a half
5341585 when one or two well regarded developers go into areas like this buyers and brokers begin recognising its potential
5341586 in years past you had a much wider distribution of property prices when developers ventured into undesirable areas
5341587 property developers see financial opportunity in these areas so they invest with the idea of actually getting a better than expected return on their money
5341588 the aggressive escalation of investment in these areas is a considerable shift for developers
5341589 they are beginning to see an opportunity and trying hard to exploit it
5341590 the developers dont care about the integrity of the area or its people
5341591 clients who come to us dont come here for expensive hotels and houses
5341592 there are very few brothels here that attract wealthy men so these new buildings will be out of place and probably hurt our business
5341593 just a few years ago the place i bought was abandoned
5341594 the area is changing fast and i really felt that if i waited longer to buy something id probably be priced out of the area
5341595 a red light district may seem trendy now but what happens in a few years when home prices dont appreciate
5341596 buyers wanted to get in on the ground floor of these projects but today i think some of them are worried about their investments

5341610 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5341611 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5341612 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5341613 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5341614 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5341615 theres not a lot of moisture in the forecast and its definitely dry in some spots in ohio michigan parts of indiana and minnesota
5341616 the crops will continue to fill under very little stress
5341617 this warmer weather could push crop development a little ahead
5341618 there isnt much bullish momentum so we will probably stay pretty volatile
5341619 the more mature the crop the more were measuring the actual yield the less mature the more potential were measuring and when you start measuring yield potential you start running into potential problems

5341623 i know how tough it is how unpredictable it is the current the cold the waves the chop theres so many challenges
5341624 once you get out there you cant think about how far youve got to go other than i think ok im gonna get a water break in 20 minutes im gonna swim to that water break take it and then go to the next one thats how you will yourself through it
5341625 you need to record something like this because its not every day you find something that looks like this running around out in the middle of the county
5341626 you know its just kind of one of those things to hear about and talk about but to actually see something on video that may actually be a live one thats pretty amazing
5341627 maybe its better to just think it is the chupacabra and just leave it at that

5341632 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5341633 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5341634 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5341635 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5341636 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5341637 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5341638 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5341639 the great difference is that i intend to win it first

5341717 any great nation needs to rely on creativity and innovation in order to leave its mark on history as well as to drive its economy for chinas economic miracle to continue it is imperative to re discover its native sense of inventiveness the same inventiveness that created china itself however the countrys leaders know that a truly creative and free thinking population will also be much more likely to demand innovation in politics as well as industry meaning the party remains wary of too much reform democracy is a great energizer of invention but is a step too far for the present government instead the party has sought to channel national innovation into paths that will bolster its own hold on power rather than allow any form of blue skies thinking that is free and undirected scientific enquiry the party directs innovation and a huge amount of finance into politically impressive projects such as its space program whereas in the united states cash and ingenuity results in creativity as in the case of microsoft for example in china the governments money directs all things which usually dampens the sparks of innovation

5341725 we have several players who have not seen a lot of court time and we look at that as a positive because what you get from that is an excitement and a competition level where you can push your players to be better because there is something to fight for
5341726 theres no set lineup where you have a certain six players are guaranteed to be in the game and thats what i like i want them to fight for positions on the court i think it gives everyone a chance to play and its exciting to see what the team will do and how they push themselves to succeed so theres no limit to what we can do
5341727 laura is great at controlling the flow of the game
5341728 her biggest strength is that having been a three year starter for the tigers she knows the conference well and she knows her opponents which could be an advantage for our young squad shes excited about the challenge of leading this young team
5341729 annes knowledge of the game and experience is invaluable to our coaching staff
5341730 its always good to be able to discuss ideas with her and know that no matter what the situation she has seen it

5341739 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5341740 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5341741 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5341742 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5341743 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5341744 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5341745 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5341746 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5341747 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5341748 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5341749 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

5341751 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5341752 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5341753 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5341754 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5341755 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

5341761 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5341762 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

5341769 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5341770 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

5341777 strategy includes a national effort to build latrines educate community members on trachoma prevention and train rural eye care workers to distribute antibiotics and perform sight preserving eyelid surgeries these interventions cost very little but contribute immeasurably to an individuals quality of life
5341778 developing nations spend 500 million to educate health care workers who leave to work in north america western europe and south asia

5341957 we asked for your help we asked for the chance to take this business and turn it forward to get out from under the weight of immediate costs that were threatening to close our doors forever and begin the task of paying down debts that were accrued in our original location and you responded thanks to you all we are still here we have raised enough capital to cover necessary operating expenses and give us a clear sight into the fall
5341958 there is still much for us yet to do we have operating expenses caught up and have made some traction into tomorrow but we will still be working on paying down our debts for the foreseeable future i would be remiss to state that all is well and that we are completely in the clear though we are at least now in a position to address our concerns i am still working to secure the long term future of the bookstore and will be open to investment of any level up to that of a partnership in the business

5341963 basically the ferrari has more of a tendency to understeer than the mclaren
5341964 the mclaren is a little bit oversteery when the tyre has good grip the car with the oversteer tendency will be quicker over a single lap than a neutral or understeering car
5341965 but when you think about racing conditions especially with the temperatures we had at the hungaroring then an oversteering car will have heat generating at the rear much higher than the understeering car
5341966 looking at hungary and lewis hamiltons car behaviour after a few laps he struggled with oversteer so he was making lots of counter steering movements on the other hand the ferrari had a good balance after a few laps

5342008 the cantons currently work together in really varied areas from education and justice to environmental protection
5342009 there are already many government conferences where the specialist directors of the individual cantons meet to coordinate their various efforts the house of cantons is simply an organisational structural measure to improve and facilitate this coordination to make the cooperation more efficient
5342010 it could even be the case that the intensification of cooperation could lead in the long term to the abolition or a reform of the current cantons many cantons are currently too small to fulfil all their functions
5342011 and on the other side the population has become more mobile and needs coordination just think of the various education systems
5342012 the new constitution introduced in 2000 in particular cut back in certain areas the participation of cantons in national politics
5342013 cantons together with the voters build the foundation of switzerland
5342014 historically the cantons wanted to build a common state it is therefore important that the cantons can better defend their interests
5342015 the government has received more authority signing bilateral treaties with various member states that would actually come under the jurisdiction of the cantons for example the police data protection schengen abolition of border controls and so on the cantons are then obliged to implement these treaties which they themselves have perhaps not signed
5342016 but this weakening of cantons powers was recognised in the nineties and the cantons right to participate particularly in treaties was addressed at a governmental level

5342020 motion capture is data driven you just capture the data and play it back says sueda our approach is a simulation in which the starting point is the physics of muscle and tendon movement suedas team also clothed their virtual muscles and tendons in a layer of skin just like real skin its shape depends on the anatomy beneath it the parameters to control the deformation of the skin arent biomechanical its just cosmetic says sueda but because the underlying controlled muscles and tendons are accurately placed the result is a hand animation that is highly realistic
5342021 we describe an automatic technique for generating the motion of tendons and muscles under the skin of a traditionally animated character this is achieved by integrating the traditional animation pipeline with a novel biomechanical simulator capable of dynamic simulation with complex routing constraints on muscles and tendons we also describe an algorithm for computing the activation levels of muscles required to track the input animation we demonstrate the results with several animations of the human hand
5342022 we have developed a method for efficient biomechanical simulation of subcutaneous tendons and muscles the simulation is incorporated into a traditional animation pipeline and can automatically generate secondary motion of the skin we are able to produce dynamic simulations with complex routing constraints that were previously not tackled in either the graphics or the biomechanics communities we have also developed a novel controller that automatically computes the muscle activation levels given some target movement of the skeleton we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by simulating the musculotendons of the human hand
5342023 other than the hands our method should work well with areas where muscles and tendons are near the surface with little subcutaneous fat such as the feet neck forearms and hamstrings however more work needs to be done before it can be applied to areas of the body with volumetric muscles such as the shoulder or the spine

5342078 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5342079 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5342080 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5342081 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5342082 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5342083 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5342084 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5342085 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5342086 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5342087 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5342088 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5342089 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5342090 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5342091 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5342092 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5342100 the one is the global and the other is about domestic politics the student protests that took place in paris earlier that year influenced the students at uct
5342101 up until that year and for about 10 years before that nusas and the student movement had engaged in ritualistic protest
5342102 it had been a period of polite reactive protest but after the occupation on campus students took the struggle way beyond campus this had a long term impact and it is good to see this past event being recognised for doing that

5342162 the board is considering the proposal and does not have any comment with respect to the proposal at this time
5342163 zis refusal to negotiate is perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week
5342164 we continue to believe in the merits of our proposal for zi shareholders and remain committed to pursuing a transaction in fact it is hard to imagine that the zi boards unwillingness to negotiate with nuance and to provide information that would support a basis for a higher offer is consistent with the zi boards fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of zi and its shareholders

5342189 this gentleman knows this about himself and is in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5342190 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5342191 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5342192 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5342193 aig said that had they known that andrew white had a car accident when he was 16 years old they never would have written the policy to begin with
5342194 they have gone back and searched for any reason whatsoever to deny the claim rather than look for a valid reason
5342195 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5342196 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5342197 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5342198 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures
5342199 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor
5342200 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
5342201 its possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else
5342202 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5342203 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5342204 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5342205 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5342206 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5342207 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5342208 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5342209 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5342210 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5342211 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5342212 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5342213 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5342214 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5342215 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5342216 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5342217 global scale shared computer capable of hosting the entire internet as an application
5342218 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5342219 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5342220 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5342221 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5342222 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5342223 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5342224 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5342225 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5342226 i didnt know if they were going to call it
5342227 solving the prisoner problem paves the road to solving other issues in peace negotiations
5342228 im afraid to close my eyes i havent slept waiting for him to come through the door i cant wait to hold him
5342229 when israel releases prisoners it is not seen as a concession but as a weakness
5342230 this is a decision that broadcasts weakness and complacence with the current situation
5342231 prisoners are happy for everybody who is released especially if they conducted attacks inside israel and killed people
5342232 the government will make every possible effort for the release of prisoners from israeli jails
5342233 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5342234 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5342235 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him
5342236 innocent civilians on independence day the terrorists showed their hostility to the freedom of the afghan people
5342237 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5342238 paved the way for placing the first iranian satellite in orbit
5342239 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5342240 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of international atomic energy agency discussions and are inconsistent with their u n security council obligations
5342241 israel has crossed a red line by deciding to release the perpetrators of murders against israelis
5342242 if youre here for the quick fix then this surgery is not for you
5342243 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5342244 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
5342245 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
5342246 the removal of musharraf would result in the military playing a more autonomous role on issues of relations with india including policies on kashmir support for the taleban and control over nuclear weapons
5342247 we have never interfered in pakistans internal matters pakistan should do the same
5342248 is it prime minister geelani nawaz sharif asif ali zardari or army chief general kayani
5342249 mccain also said he wanted to open up negotiations not that the lower colorado states deserved more water
5342250 mccain doesnt need to worry about our electoral votes so much if he gets californias
5342251 there is no reason that we use the same drinking quality water we use to make our food to flush our toilets
5342252 for their sake i hope we can have an apartment close to doctors surgeries because in our village they are a long way from where we live
5342253 i want someone to help me provide them with food and clothes their father is a farm worker so there is no one to help me looking after them
5342254 i want them to get education and be successful i dont want them to be farmers i want them to be educated and well off
5342255 initiated a genocide probe based on reports of actions committed by georgian troops aimed at murdering russian citizens ethnic ossetians living in south ossetia
5342256 the situation when one who committed thousands of crimes is characterised as a terrorist and another as a president of a sovereign state is very strange
5342257 they have found one wing and the tail and they are hoping to find even more as they go
5342258 what they have to do is mark out where they found everything it will be recorded and taken away for evidential purposes
5342259 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5342260 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry the collision took place around one minute from touchdown
5342261 they were all our employees that we have known in some cases for many years its a very difficult situation for all of us this is the first serious accident that the group has been involved in for over 20 years we are all extremely shocked at the unexpected tragedy
5342262 its sad when they are named i suspect we will find that we know them
5342263 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5342264 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5342265 unfortunately when the emergency services got to the casualties nothing could be done for them
5342266 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5342267 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5342268 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5342269 two women came in said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5342270 its horrifying that a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5342271 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa
5342272 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5342273 the club is working hard to ensure blah blah blah

5342278 god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
5342279 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
5342280 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more just sayin
5342281 jon voight is a frightened little girl in a pink ballet tutu who acts like obama just wandered in from the rain forest with a bone thru his nose and a communist pamphlet in his loincloth
5342282 ja ich mache fotos von den auslagen und bersichtsfotos vom gesamten flohmarkt da frage ich doch keinen
5342283 nein d rfen sie nicht sie haben mich nicht gefragt
5342284 mir egal wenn sie das nicht wollen sollten sie ihr waren nicht ffentlich pr sentieren
5342285 im so excited to be living in my own home
5342286 even if he wants publicity hes still a great guy
5342287 to be able to save more money for seeing the sights well go sleep in a tent or a train station
5342288 im on unpaid leave but its worth it there are so many people who have no chance to watch the games
5342289 but its all about the atmosphere i just wanted to bring them here and surely they know about liu xiang and the hurdles
5342290 not bad i feel really terrible about liu xiang though
5342291 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5342292 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5342293 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5342294 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5342295 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5342296 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5342297 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5342298 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5342299 we really want to get the message out to people
5342300 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5342301 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5342302 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5342303 i am shocked by this senseless and barbaric attack on one of our staff

5342320 but i tell you truly there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of god
5342321 in mark 9 1 this same thing is stated in this way

5342324 at any rate whatever his appearance may have altered into we can be certain that it was an amazing sight indeed
5342325 so what they saw was not something that was actually taking place but was a vision
5342326 16 for we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty 17 for he received from god the father honor and glory when such a voice came to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased 18 and we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain
5342327 master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for you one for moses and one for elijah
5342328 when we did not know how the bumble bee flew was that an adequate ground for positing god as the answer or was it instead cause for further scientific investigation aimed at finding out the natural explanation all of science is the result of choosing the latter approach once there was a time when nothing was explained since then everything which has been explained has been found to have a natural not a divine explanation although this does not prove that all future explanations will be of like kind it shows that it is not at all unreasonable to expect this and it is not a very reliable bet to expect the opposite
5342329 you cant prove that jesus didnt rise from the dead
5342330 people do not rise from the dead after three days
5342331 hitler thought his ideas were the best thing for humanity too

5342338 when two hydrogen get fused into helium in the sun they should create a nearly massless particle called a neutrino these will be difficult to detect since they are so small that they should very seldom interact with other matter in order to detect them we have filled this container with chlorine and have placed it in a mine to shield it from cosmic rays when the neutrinos strike the chlorine it should create a molecule of argon and we can monitor how much argon is created we do not want to rely on this experiment alone so we have also set up a lab to watch heavy deuterium water a few miles beneath the surface of the earth when neutrinos force molecules of such water to eject an electron we should be able to measure it via cerenkov radiation as expected the results from both experiments are consistent with each other
5342339 we know jesus is lord because he performed miracles like walking on water
5342340 95 of the people in the world believe in god surely they cant all be wrong
5342341 to set up a straw man or set up a straw man argument is to describe a position that superficially resembles an opponents actual view but is easier to refute then attribute that position to the opponent for example deliberately overstating the opponents position

5342383 we did not say that we are champions of the world all we said was that we would like our teams to win which is not unreasonable why else would we go there
5342384 it shows a frankly unflattering and rather harsh light on the different attitudes that we have as canadian citizens about mental health and behaviour in general

5342416 with visual voice mail were able to offer customers more options to help them better prioritize voice mail messages from family friends colleagues and business partners in a more timely and effective manner
5342417 but the phone was ringing off the hook so i didnt focus on motivating employees
5342418 americans were afraid to travel and that meant they didnt need limos to take them around washington
5342419 i heard them talk about playing games to team build and a light bulb went off
5342420 its not that i didnt know about the benefits of team building dozens of companies used our limos and vans to transport their own employees to nights out on the town or other adventures it just never dawned on me that it was so critical
5342421 we divided the staff into six teams and each group took a limousine into washington d c they had to fill a small bottle with water from the reflecting pool and buy a gift from fords theater among other tasks
5342422 the outing made me realize that having fun was truly the key to success
5342423 i learned that if you invest in making your employees happy it comes back 100 times
5342424 she is one of those people who is always there when you need her someone who goes beyond friendship and is truly a sister i watch her share her money her time and her laughter with people and it always makes me smile even when things get a little rocky she always has a smile on her face and a kind word to say shes a straight shooter but is also someone who never ceases to see the bright side of things kristina is one of those women you are honored to call your friend
5342425 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5342426 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5342427 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5342428 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5342429 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5342430 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5342431 parents have told us they appreciate the notification features chaperone offers because it gives them the security of knowing where their children are and the ability to locate them when they are carrying their wireless phones
5342432 now with chaperone 2 0 we have added new capabilities that make the service even more useful for parents and for kids
5342433 it was increased in december by 1 per pound on selected items
5342434 nobody really noticed though i think at this point people are just so used to it now they arent even blinking
5342435 mostly our effect has been the cost of getting goods shipped to us
5342436 thats where weve been seeing a price increase and also when we ship goods out using carriers like ups and fed ex
5342437 i really dont want to increase my prices because i really enjoy the loyalty of the customer and i really enjoy customers coming in here and not feeling pressured when they see the products gone up 1 or 2

5342440 the claim it was a gun free zone was sort of a misnomer
5342441 what were trying to stop is people carrying loaded guns in a concealed manner in the nonsecure areas
5342442 this is a gun free airport which means it is illegal to have loaded concealed weapons at the airport
5342443 how long would it take somebody to take a glock a pistol out of its case and load it right at the ticket counter if you are a terrorist thats how you would do it anyway

5342446 fire eagle is about making everything on the internet more useful fun or interesting by adding the element of location
5342447 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
5342448 the combination of outside ins new radar feature and fire eagles amazingly simple and powerful api means that our users can now see all the news and buzz within 1 000 feet of their current location updated from any number of applications and devices
5342449 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
5342450 pownce users can now say where they are and geotag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
5342451 we can find partners spread the risk and improve our ability to address these markets
5342452 this new strategy gives very talented people in ibm an outlet for their work
5342453 what an inspiring event the timing couldnt be better to be inspired during a time of adversity
5342454 he was always such a bigger than football kind of guy
5342455 he wasnt just going to hang in the locker room and shoot the bull he was always on to something else community service or a meeting of some sort he understood before most of us did that there was going to be a life after football
5342456 thats the whole fight but the game hasnt even started yet everything is to make it heal to re implant the knee thats when the game starts thats kickoff
5342457 he was a great player for us for a long time and i consider him not only a significant part of our history but also a personal friend
5342458 unfortunately im being treated like any other player that ever played for the bengals
5342459 maybe the team can walk away from that but i cant walk let alone walk away
5342460 i saw the sons and daughters of the most affluent families in america the most well connected political families in america and i had a chance to compete with them on equal footing and hold my own
5342461 he was obviously one of the highest recruits they had ever had but he related to others extraordinarily well
5342462 he was always admired for his natural leadership by example and by what he had to say he always had that presence he was someone that others looked up to
5342463 before my first preseason game in cincinnati i remember reggie beating up the bathroom
5342464 he was just beating it up yelling hitting things throwing stuff
5342465 i was getting rocked and having to get out of the huddle and make a play
5342466 while controversial and aggressive no one ever questioned his integrity or his conviction and passion about what he was doing
5342467 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5342468 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system
5342469 seventeen years of sport at the highest level is a long time
5342470 we are approaching a pull the plug kind of decision
5342471 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all we are doing is wasting money
5342472 if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
5342473 the whole stadium was there just for me that was just so cool
5342474 i felt that i could not go out with the world record because of the support the crowd gave me
5342475 we saw the pain but liu was determined to run liu would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable or there was no way out
5342476 our group has been working on understanding heparin biosynthesis for almost 30 years
5342477 we are working on what might be the next generation of heparin production with no animal source
5342478 we treat it to reduce the molecular size then subject it to enzymatic steps to convert it to heparin
5342479 we use recombinant enzymes that are part of the natural pathway for heparin synthesis
5342480 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible
5342481 we have talked to a number of them they all are interested in the approach but want to wait
5342482 but those drugs are a thousand times more expensive than heparin also they are not as good as heparin it has multiple activities many of which benefit patients those drugs are very specific they work well only for a small number of applications
5342483 we believe that the heparin market is here to stay
5342484 some people experience a serious mood change when the seasons change they may sleep too much have little energy and crave sweets and starchy foods they may also feel depressed though symptoms can be severe they usually clear up
5342485 when i try to raise my thoughts to heaven there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp knives and hurt my very soul i have no faith
5342486 i am a child of doubt and unbelief what terrible suffering it has cost me and still costs me this longing to believe which is so much the stronger in my soul as more arguments against it rise up within me my hosanna has passed thorugh the crucible of doubt
5342487 theyre trying to buy some gucci im trying to buy the mall
5342488 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5342489 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5342490 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5342491 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5342492 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5342493 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5342494 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5342495 eric is a seasoned leader who brings strong global management experience and a successful track record to this new very important role

5342503 the law is very clear that each state will have its own police force with a dgp if you make these police forces efficient only a few crimes can be given to cbi the cbi is our fbi
5342504 you can give some offences to the cbi for probe which have to be investigated under the treaty obligation like terrorism money laundering as also drugs related offences for which we already have narcotics control bureau
5342505 we have ignored the police force for decades many reports on improvement of working conditions have not been implemented and the quality of police officers has not improved training programmes like this would help

5342513 this defendant preyed on the most vulnerable among us to make a fast buck using fear violence and intimidation he forced women and children into the tragic world of prostitution and drugs
5342514 the prison sentence handed down today denies webster the freedom he denied his victims and those who commit similar crimes should expect to be prosecuted
5342515 evil takes many forms don webster a k a jerry starr embodies several of them
5342516 he is a drug pusher who used both cocaine and crack to enslave his victims he is a disgusting bully who manipulated women and children he is a physical abuser who forced his will upon weaker people with threats of burning them with boiling water confining them to a closet beating and raping them and even choking a woman to the point of unconsciousness in the presence of two other women and a child he is a thief who stole their dignity and hope he is a violent predator who deserves the sentence imposed today there are people in our world who need to be locked up and put away for a long time jerry starr is one of them
5342517 from 8 p m on august17 to 8 a m on august 18 480 trucks carrying various commodities like meat lpg tankers and essential products traveled from jammu to srinagar
5342518 jammu and kashmir is not an international issue it is an internal issue but unfortunately pakistan and people with secessionist tendencies have unfortunately tried to internationalise this issue and there is no doubt that it is our internal issue
5342519 we are very happy to announce that after an afternoon faculty review meeting of all available data we found out that none of the deaths can be attributed to drugs

5342527 theyve always got this phone in their hand texting is something that they are very comfortable with its really their preferred means of communication for a lot of them so we wanted to provide information to them this way

5342530 i will offer a middle class tax cut so we can lift up hard working families and give relief to struggling home owners
5342531 we watched 50 pounds about 23 kilograms of flour go in successive weeks from 13 to 26 to 36 dollars for a sack of flour so the prices have really jumped up everybody is really worried about how they are going to buy food
5342532 people cannot afford that what about the people who have to drive far to work everyday and they cannot afford to
5342533 people are losing their homes jobs and a lot of things are facing us as challenges as americans we are all ready for a change
5342534 as the gas prices climb and i am not being sarcastic if they go up a dime 10 cents i lose two or three regular customers
5342535 the second tier is composed of international issues mainly iraq secondarily afghanistan and the overall war on terror
5342536 now having said that and it seems likely that those are the major issues there are tertiary third ranking issues that matter the environment education
5342537 national security defending us from those that want to destroy us i believe there are those people and the way to stop those is to be diligent to follow them and track them down but also to bring freedom and democracy that do not have it and i want to see either president do that
5342538 i have family and friends that are over there and they shouldnt be over there
5342539 well of course the economy and then education this democracy cannot work if the population is not educated
5342540 we dont have anybody else to turn to but god
5342541 we have to turn these problems over to god and not to man
5342542 prayer is the answer to every problem in life said twyman founder of the pray at the pump movement whose followers huddle around gas pumps and ask the almighty to lower gasoline prices

5342550 we saw a range of all new mainframe clients this year across the world particularly in emerging markets such as china and india
5342551 many companies are facing both space and power constraints in their datacenters and are clamoring for increased datacenter efficiency
5342552 clients want datacenters that are designed for specific processes that can help them consolidate servers and improve their energy efficiency
5342553 the mainframe has been completely redesigned and is as modern if not more modern than any other platform out there
5342554 trusty mainframes are alive and kicking and remain critical components of a companys it infrastructure especially for mission critical high volume transactional environments like financial services where the mainframe has proven itself to be a trusted platform for housing large amounts of data in a secure and centrally managed environment
5342555 we suspect that much of this growth is coming from existing mainframe users who are either upgrading or growing their mainframe usage
5342556 scale up the performance of sophisticated data analysis and other bi functions against larger volumes of data
5342557 bi is still a growing market pushing the software onto the mainframe helps companies to both protect and leverage their mainframe investments that is using bi to drive legacy modernization without replacement of the mainframe
5342558 classic mainframe myths still exist today mainframes have traditionally been associated with high total cost of ownership lack of advanced applications inability to support real time low latency processing poor back end data integration support a shortage of mainframe skills and steep and inflexible development and maintenance curves
5342559 there are simply not enough young bright people wanting to learn mainframe skills over php java flash and other hip web 2 0 technologies

5342566 i have a 5 year old daughter and at that moment i thought im really glad she didnt come with me
5342567 the adults gasped and almost all the young children started crying
5342568 im sure some rational thinking scientists think its a bad thing
5342569 of course its fun but thats not really the ultimate goal
5342570 its engaging visitors to see other things in the museum and experience the real thing
5342571 they were taking it through its paces and it was mind boggling
5342572 we were creating what the story could be so you could build scenes with action rising to a climax and a resolution
5342573 they like being in on a unique one time thing
5342574 it is a big dinosaur but it isnt school bus sized
5342575 a little archaic in their movement because in general we now think dinosaurs were all very active and agile creatures

5342577 whoever is elected president will have the power to fundamentally transform the future of abortion politics
5342578 if he selects tom ridge hes going to inflict a mortal wound on his campaign
5342579 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5342580 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5342581 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5342582 hes kind of acknowledged as the individual that founded the specialty of healthcare law
5342583 hes been a real driver and force in the industry
5342584 thousands of healthcare cases and clients almost single handedly creating a legal specialty that is now so highly populated by busy lawyers he joked about having his own personal alumni association
5342585 when he started practicing in 1940 there was no specialty of healthcare law
5342586 it was lawyers who served on boards of directors of hospitals who did the work pro bono now for example the national health lawyers assn has grown to 10 000 members
5342587 hospitals were represented like churches it was pro bono work because of the amount of time i spent on it i established the pattern of being paid for it
5342588 you only had a relatively few hospitals back in those days back then you didnt have organized medical groups or integrated medical groups you didnt have medicare or medicaid
5342589 it was just a hell of a lot simpler back then now a hospital has every legal problem that a business has plus a medical staff which complicates things very much
5342590 without his leadership our members certainly would not have the same rich specialty in which to earn their living and contribute to society
5342591 healthcare is a cause at least it became a cause for me and thats the way most people in this industry feel its really been a great career

5342621 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked
5342622 the approval of excessive transfer credits and excessive units for independent study in lieu of coursework
5342623 we always take any issue regarding academic integrity very seriously

5342627 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5342632 we have a 100 billion space station and in theory we couldnt even get people up there
5342633 there is the concern that these near misses are not being treated as educational experiences

5342641 committed to continuing the successful implementation of the offender management model and to ensuring that offender managers have access to the necessary information to allow them to effectively manage offenders within custody and in the community
5342642 replace unstable at risk it systems across the probation and prison services
5342643 a programme of work will begin to replace those case management systems which are most at risk in the short term with a system delius already successfully in use in the two largest probation areas and then to address the technical assistive technology and ergonomic problems with the legacy system crams that most areas now use
5342644 given the scale of the implementation and technical issues with performance implementation has led to courts experiencing slowness and downtime
5342645 although on launch the sms supplier management system operated well with low user levels problems arose as the users increased and as a result was withdrawn for external users

5342648 he more than anyone opened my eyes about current affairs and sociological trends
5342649 they had all the great broad coverage but not the local
5342650 so they asked me to organize the suburban area and add zoning to what they were doing
5342651 so we have to re aggregate these audiences through many different channels thats the way were going to collect audiences in the future it may be through multiple newspapers web sites and mobile news operations
5342652 there will be a transitional period where the operation has to exist on a different scale
5342653 that means well have fewer people than we have right now well still have in chicago the largest news gathering operation by far and well have to make the best use of those people and those dollars than we ever have before
5342654 really understand what people want and how to give it to them i place a premium on curiosity versatility and being able to work in a variety of different media
5342655 theres never been more media than there is now and people are consuming more of it than ever
5342656 within this are huge opportunities but you will have to be adaptable and be willing to innovate and create all the time on your own you cant just stand back and not be a force for change
5342657 im really in love with you and ive already told you i wouldnt hurt you and i mean that but im not going to keep holding on forever you could lose me

5342665 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5342666 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5342667 oh my god he hates me and im so terrible etc etc
5342668 he cant stand the way i look and i repulse him
5342669 i set out to do that but to put it into practice and actually do it is another thing
5342670 i dont think anyone saw that time coming through its pretty special
5342671 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5342672 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5342673 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5342674 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5342675 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5342676 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5342677 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5342678 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5342679 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5342680 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5342681 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5342682 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5342683 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5342711 jay nixon after having three years to figure out how hes going to run for governor and the first major policy he runs out on health care has a 265 million mathematical error
5342712 he cannot ever be trusted to speak authoritatively on health care ever again
5342713 it would grow exponentially and you have to find that money every year going forward if he says he can do it with anything other than a tax increase hes lying
5342714 our opponents slashed health care for hundreds of thousands of missourians and they still havent corrected it
5342715 if your basic principle is that government should do the minimum youre not going to be developing a lot of new ideas for a government role
5342716 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5342717 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5342718 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5342719 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5342720 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5342721 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5342722 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5342723 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5342724 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5342725 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5342726 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5342727 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5342728 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5342729 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5342730 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5342758 this bill will end the practice of unwilled dead body trafficking
5342759 as an asian american i know that few people from my community would voluntarily donate their organs or bodies due to the strong cultural preference of leaving their body intact for burial after death

5342800 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now
5342801 but the fact that commodities are declining is overall good for consumers and good for the market
5342802 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5342803 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5342804 you saw last year we finished eighth and we managed to get beaten in the first final
5342805 its nice to get into the finals but if we play finals this year it will be good to play them in good form
5342806 if you limp into them you have then got to determine do you make sure kieren jacks playing in the finals and patrick veszpremis playing in the finals and at least get some experience for those young players
5342807 we might have to bring some young players back in for this week because if you do lose or youre not playing well at least youre gaining something from it
5342808 theres not a lot to be gained losing with the same sort of team at least this year weve introduced a lot of new players
5342809 its all relative if we dont make the eight and we blood some young kids then its a positive
5342810 every team says they have to make the eight at the start of the year and were still in the mix and thats an important factor at this time of year
5342811 id certainly rather be playing games that have a degree of pressure and the young kids are learning something rather than 13th versus 16th or whatever so its good to be involved in the finals and i said that to the players before the game and hopefully they do feel that excitement with two weeks to go
5342812 my focus this week is no different to what it was last week
5342813 i knew last week we needed to win at least another game to play in the finals but that didnt change what we wanted to do against geelong so it doesnt change this week at all weve got to play a lot better this week regardless of where we sit or whats happened with the other teams
5342814 if you are a poor starter you can break and make sure the entire field is on its last chance
5342815 we want the sport to be as well presented as possible
5342816 at the moment its taking 10 minutes to get underway in a race that only takes 9 69sec
5342817 its not surprising the iaaf is looking at this obviously over the years there have been a number of changes and modifications made but they still dont seem to have achieved the intended outcome
5342818 it would be up to our congress if it comes in there will be a hue and cry just like there was in swimming but then people accept the rule and settle down

5342836 i want to see why michael phelps can get up eight times i want to know why that happens
5342837 i talked to bob bowman his coach about that for a little while yesterday but i want to talk to him some more to see how he did that because i saw phelps yesterday after his eighth event and he was emotionally drained and physically drained too but he was able to get himself in a space where he could repeat and repeat and repeat and i want to learn more about that

5342858 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5342859 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation

5342872 zis refusal to negotiate is perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week
5342873 we continue to believe in the merits of our proposal for zi shareholders and remain committed to pursuing a transaction in fact it is hard to imagine that the zi boards unwillingness to negotiate with nuance and to provide information that would support a basis for a higher offer is consistent with the zi boards fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of zi and its shareholders

5342900 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5342901 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5342902 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to under cut john mccain
5342903 the surge has succeeded and yet senator obama still cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5342904 nor has he been willing to heed the guidance of general petraeus or to listen to our troops on the ground when they say as they have said to me on my trips to iraq let us win just let us win instead senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight even in hindsight he would oppose the surge
5342905 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5342906 before al qaeda in iraq is defeated and before a competent trained and capable iraqi security force is in place and operating effectively
5342907 there will be no place among g 8 nations or in the wto for a modern russia that acts at times like the old soviet union the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5342908 recently mccain responded to mitt romneys statement that he understood the economy based on his many years in the private sector by claiming romney had said a military career is not a real job
5342909 mccains neurotic boast that he is the only republican who supported the surge is beginning to sound as insane as bill clintons claim to being the first black president although less insulting to blacks
5342910 and yet for the 4 billionth time at the jan
5342911 a review of contemporaneous news stories about the surge clearly demonstrates that the only republicans who were so much as skeptical of the surge consisted of a few oddball liberal republicans such as sens gordon smith norm coleman and olympia snowe
5342912 they certainly werent attacking mccain their standard bearer in liberal republicanism but even if they were it was a low point for mccain being criticized by the likes of olympia snowe
5342913 like the democrats mccain thinks if he simply says something over and over again he can make people believe its true thus again at the south carolina debate on jan 10 mccain was proclaiming that he was the only one on this stage who supported the surge
5342914 mr straight talk announced one of the reasons why i won in new hampshire is because i went there and told them the truth that and the fact that democrats were allowed to vote in the republican primary
5342915 even in the florida primary allegedly limited to republicans mccain lost among republicans seventeen percent of the republican primary voters in florida called themselves independents
5342916 at least under president hillary republicans in congress would know that theyre supposed to fight back when president mccain proposes the same ideas tax hikes liberal judges and social security for illegals republicans in congress will support our president
5342917 it is incontrovertible multiple sources confirm that they remember it the same way and they are not john funds source as novak reports
5342918 mccain long after the fact repeated what the ted kennedy moveon people for the american way crowd said about alito
5342919 it makes no sense but he said it whether he remembers the specific comment or not he did say it so we need to try to understand it or at least get some pretty detailed commitments from senator mccain going forward i hope he and others will understand why this is necessary a president who confuses adherence to judicial restraint with conservative political decisions is very confused about how to select judges it is one thing to vote for and even praise judges some other chief executive has picked especially when it would be political suicide not to it is another to discern good supreme court appointments just ask ronald reagan or george bush pere or fils take your pick
5342920 senator john mccain as recently reported and discussed here and on the corner has said privately that he would not appoint jurists like justice samuel alito because he wears his conservatism on his sleeve
5342921 to refresh recollections many of justice alitos former law clerks fellow article iii judges and others a good number of whom were liberal democrats testified during his senate confirmation to the exact opposite proposition that justice alito did not wear any political ideology or convictions on his sleeve
5342922 but does russias behavior cause obama to rethink reliance on soft power dialogue disapproval diplomacy economic carrots and sticks which putin considers almost an oxymoron
5342923 does russias resort to military coercion and its arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles cause obama to revise his resistance to missile defense

5343147 mccain has used the past month to really get back into the game
5343148 this vacation allowed mccain to gain a bit of ground even if obama got some rest and out of the media eye and that means this contest is a bit more uncertain than democrats want it to be

5343239 how much classifying becomes necessary in a war im sure your father was right about dogs but that was in peacetime
5343240 if everyone started putting dog notions onto application forms i am fully in sympathy with you because i know how hard it is nowadays to define just what one really is our fathers or mothers whichever they were had no such problem to face it existed of course but it was not yet recognized but this is not a defined age such as theirs was which means that we who live in it must be all the more definite if were are going to achieve any kind of stability

5343244 we are dealing with the patient registry in a timely manner and with new incentives in the master agreement with island physicians the numbers are dropping our hope is that they will continue to do so
5343245 we are encouraging islanders who do not yet have a family physician to contact the patient registry
5343246 to get a more accurate picture of how many people need a family doctor and to assist those in acquiring one islanders who have not previously registered on the patient registry should call the patient registry number

5343271 drei rzte k mmerten sich um ihn im aufw rmbereich doch was sie auch versuchten es war zwecklos denn die verletzung ist an der rechten ferse also am startfu wo der meiste druck entsteht
5343272 ich berquerte danach die linie und nahm an er sei da aber dann schaute ich r ber und er wars nicht ich war erstaunt
5343273 die gesundheit geht vor wir haben daf r verst ndnis

5343291 he has made everything beautiful in its time he has also set eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what god has done from beginning to end
5343292 for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened

5343306 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
5343307 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
5343308 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
5343309 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
5343310 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
5343311 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
5343312 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
5343313 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
5343314 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
5343315 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
5343316 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
5343317 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
5343318 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
5343319 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
5343320 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
5343321 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
5343322 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
5343323 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular

5343341 what do you really know about the gifts of the spirit
5343342 those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires
5343343 by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
5343344 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
5343345 by what hath been said we may define what are the grand uses of speech viz the glorifying of god and the benefiting of men and this helps us to an infallible test by which to try our words for since everything is so far approvable as it answers the end of its being what part soever of our discourses agrees not with these primitive ends of speech will not hold weight in the balance of the sanctuary it will therefore nearly concern us to enter upon this scrutiny to bring our words to this touchstone for though in our depraved estimate the eloquence of language is more regarded than the innocence though we think our words vanish with the breath that utters them yet they become records in gods court are laid up in his archives as witnesses either for or against us for he who is truth itself hath told us that by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned mat 12 37
5343346 may you be covered in your rabbis dust and may you thirstily drink his words

5343352 everything about the wendy preview clicked for our stations from conception to promotion to hitting the air it completely broke the mold the show is now a proven winner and we cant wait to see it debut across the country next year
5343353 our plan has always been to offer stations a proven performer with broad appeal to todays viewers as well as a production that has been perfected over the course of 30 preview episodes now they will have the chance to launch wendy far ahead of the crowded pack of new talk shows on tap for fall 2009
5343354 doing the daily show for the past six weeks has really been one of the most exciting times in my life it has given me the chance to be myself while living out my dream and connecting with my fans on a whole new level i am incredibly excited about coming back next year and want to thank the fox television stations group and debmar mercury for all their help in getting this show on the air and making it a true phenomenon this summer

5343363 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5343364 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5343365 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5343375 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
5343376 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration

5343381 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
5343382 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
5343383 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
5343384 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
5343385 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
5343386 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
5343387 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
5343388 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
5343389 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
5343390 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
5343391 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
5343392 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
5343393 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
5343394 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
5343395 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
5343396 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
5343397 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
5343398 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
5343399 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
5343400 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
5343401 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004 representing the federal governments third largest reported liability it represents a significant future outflow of funds at the same time as many other competing demands for federal dollars but is currently not auditable

5343419 we recently refined our strategic focus to narrow our target audience to the 6 17 year old demographic and their co viewing parents
5343420 we seek to enter into contractual relationships with publishers that we believe appeal to a similar target audience under which we assume responsibility for selling their inventory of available advertising opportunities as well as syndicating video content to them our revenues have generally increased as a result of implementing this change and we expect our revenues to continue to grow during the remainder of fiscal year 2008
5343421 the significant increase in revenue for the second quarter was a direct result of the growing demand from brand advertisers for gofishs coveted target audience immersive advertising products and turnkey solutions
5343422 the companys potential to continue growing rapidly is further exemplified by the increase in bookings we experienced in the second quarter we believe that leading national brand advertisers are increasingly underserved in digital media

5343428 rimango esterrefatto davanti allepisodio avvenuto ieri che ha visto protagonista suo malgrado antonio conte fatti simili non hanno nulla a che fare con il calcio e la eventuale sana rivalit che ne pu scaturire ma sono dei puri e semplici atti di violenza
5343429 gli autori di tale gesto non si possono nascondere dietro al fatto di essere presunti tifosi giallorossi ma devono essere identificati per quello che sono e cio dei teppisti sono vicino come uomo e come presidente dellu s lecce ad antonio conte e credo di interpretare il pensiero di gran parte dei cittadini leccesi che nulla hanno a che spartire con chi si reso protagonista di questo vergognoso atto di violenza

5343434 one of two things causes a man to change his mind and reverse his plans want of foresight to anticipate everything or lack of foresight to execute them but as god is both omniscient and omnipotent there is never any need for him to revise his decrees
5343435 to say that god is immutable is to say that he never differs from himself the concept of a growing or developing god is not found in the scriptures it seems to me impossible to think of god as varying from himself in any way for a moral being to change it would be necessary that the change be in one of three directions he must go from better to worse or from worse to better or granted that the moral quality remain stable he must change within himself as from immature to mature or from one order of being to another it should be clear that god can move in none of these directions his perfections forever rule out any such possibility one who can suffer any slightest degree of change is neither self existent self sufficient nor eternal and so is not god

5343453 marriage is a civil right and sexual orientation is not a
5343454 while we appreciate senator obama for his support for civil unions it is unfair and un american for same sex couples to be relegated to a separate and unequal system of civil unions
5343455 we further applaud senator obamas opposition to proposition 8 which would change the california constitution to eliminate the freedom to marry for same sex couples he rightly characterizes proposition 8 as a divisive and discriminatory measure

5343457 whats the best way to get from here to there
5343458 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5343459 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5343460 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5343461 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5343462 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5343463 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5343464 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge

5343474 lautorita riposa prima di tutto sulla ragione se tu ordini al tuo popolo di andare a gettarsi in mare fara la rivoluzione ho il diritto di esigere lubbidienza perche i miei ordini sono ragionevoli

5343482 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
5343483 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
5343484 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
5343485 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
5343486 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
5343487 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5343488 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5343489 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5343490 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5343491 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5343492 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5343493 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s

5343570 i expect the rupee to move both ways we will continue with our current policy of hedging for two quarters because there is no long term visibility i expect the rupee to be in the range of rs 42 43 for the next 5 6 months
5343571 the rupee will keep swinging as oil prices soften and inflation comes down the rupee will gain but on the other hand the trade deficit is widening and there are no fresh fund inflows the recent currency movements are primarily in response to oil prices
5343572 if oil comes off prices fall then the rupee could go to rs 41 50 i expect range bound volatility between rs 41 50 rs 43 50 in the next one to two quarters
5343573 when the rupee was appreciating they said it would to go to rs 37 and when it was depreciating the figure was rs 47
5343574 for instance i dont think they will let it go to rs 45 or let it appreciate to rs 39
5343575 as long the macro economic environment remains uncertain nobody can say for sure which way the currency will move we are not increasing or decreasing our hedges at this point a lot of companies cancelled their hedges 3 4 months back they could now increase their hedges but we are not one of them

5343582 en tsjinvali ustedes no pensaron en si mismos ya que entendieron que eran la ltima esperanza de los civiles indefensos
5343583 rusia ha finalizado la operaci n sobre el fin de la agresi n de georgia contra osetia del sur
5343584 sobre una mayor cooperaci n sobre la posici n de ambas partes desde la retirada de las tropas hasta los esfuerzos humanitarios
5343585 si llaman a esto retirada entonces no entiendo el significado del mundo
5343586 rusia no permitir que se asesine impunemente a sus ciudadanos
5343587 para ello todas las posibilidades econ micas pol ticas y militares
5343588 pr cticamente no hay ninguna ocasi n en la historia del estado ruso o sovi tico en que nosotros empez ramos primero acciones militares
5343589 nosotros no atacamos a nadie simplemente garantizamos los derechos y dignidad del pueblo como fuerzas de paz
5343590 para ello es necesaria una retirada incondicional de vuestras tropas
5343591 nous sommes vigilants sur le respect des engagements pris en particulier sur le retrait des troupes russes et videmment sur le libre acc s des organisations humanitaires aux populations civiles
5343592 ce point ndlr le retrait nest pas n gociable mes yeux il doit concerner toutes les forces russes qui sont entr es en g orgie depuis le 7 ao t si cette clause de laccord de cessez le feu n tait pas appliqu e rapidement et totalement je serais amen convoquer un conseil europ en extraordinaire pour d cider des cons quences en tirer
5343593 jesp re quil a cette fois lintention de tenir son engagement
5343594 nous exigeons le retrait sans d lai des forces doccupation russes
5343595 ensuite commen ons r fl chir n gocier sur la mani re d viter un divorce d finitif entre nos deux pays
5343596 cherchons r gler les probl mes par des m thodes civilis es
5343597 la seule condition pr alable est le retrait imm diat et inconditionnel des forces russes et la fin compl te de loccupation de la g orgie
5343598 la g orgie ne se rendra jamais ne tol rera jamais la perte de la plus petite parcelle de son territoire

5343601 hes a brother in deed and a brother in need
5343602 i was willing to go a bit more but 750 000 well stop there
5343603 i think its a huge win for the game we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5343604 its a tough climate out there and sponsorships are hard to get simple as that
5343605 its probably pending theyll leave but we havent got final confirmation
5343606 our position remains his prospects of coming back to the nrl ever are not good

5343610 theres nothing like running scared from the rest of the field
5343611 it definitely played through my mind and how close loretta came in athens
5343612 i call her the queen because shes the greatest female triathlete weve ever seen
5343613 to do it under that much pressure with that much expectation just shows what a quality athlete she is
5343614 its a terrible shame but we can understand he must have done everything he could
5343615 liu how come youre so good at shooting adverts for tv but now you cant run time for you to step off the stage for ever
5343616 this is the darkest of our olympic days all our 1 3 billion people have lost face liu you should have crawled to the finish line
5343617 xiang xiang it is you whom we love not gold
5343618 liu has the right to be injured the expectations of our people should not be carried by him alone they are too heavy to be borne by such a young man lets share the burden the momentum to make our country great
5343619 is a great athlete hes unique his psychological qualities are also great
5343620 they seemed to use us as a bit of a springboard but i wouldnt be jumping out of my skin if i were them thinking theyre back
5343621 i think our performance tonight was reasonably dominant before the game we didnt talk about the fact weve won the last seven times against them we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
5343622 referees boss robert finch knows my thoughts on cecchin they havent changed
5343623 ill leave it at that you wont drag me in on that
5343624 if we stay healthy and keep our composure i dont see why we cant be
5343625 at the moment when we get it right were a very good side its just that we havent been getting it right all year
5343626 instead of panicking when we get into decent scoring situations were listening more to halfback brett finch and five eighth kris keating and it seems to be working pretty well
5343627 i feel very proud and very honoured to be an australian and to have the gold medal around my neck at the olympic games
5343628 we came so close in sydney and athens this makes up for those very close silver medals its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home the gold medal and do your country proud
5343629 i thought it was better to hurdle the barricade than the car
5343630 i call her the queen shes the greatest female triathlete we have ever seen
5343631 to do it under that much expectation and pressure takes a quality athlete she knocked on my door eight years ago and she was a little tiny girl but she was incredibly determined
5343632 i didnt want to leave anything behind on that 10km run
5343633 theres nothing like running scared from the rest of the field to give you motivation
5343634 i felt every kilometre of that race today it was extremely hard but in training there are so many days when you are tired and you are hurting and you are in a world of pain and thats when i practise for days like this the race is only two hours
5343635 it was tough but i had a little plan to pace myself for the first two laps then give it everything
5343636 i didnt expect to come away with a medal the bronze means the world to me
5343637 the medal is silver but its like gold to me because portugal is a little country that didnt get into triathlon that early i think its good for portugal and europe to put a girl in the top three
5343638 we were nice and relaxed and it ended up all right
5343639 i think i got about nine hours sleep my best sleep of the week
5343640 when the first boat went through the line and the gun went off we just looked at each other and thought weve just got to get through that line
5343641 we knew we had it but to actually come through the line with gold made the past four years worth it
5343642 its a pretty nice feeling to have an olympic medal around my neck
5343643 we have won five world championships before we waited a long time for this medal
5343644 all the efforts that we put in finally paid off and we got what we waited for
5343645 we saw all the boats behind us at one point and we thought to ourselves we might as well win our only olympic medal race
5343646 it does go a long way dont worry about that she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5343647 we knew how to control it and what we needed to do
5343648 we knew you didnt have to go out and win every race
5343649 if you were consistent enough you would be fine at the end of the day
5343650 comptia certifications provide it workers with internationally recognized respected credentials that validate their technical proficiency and professionalism
5343651 we are extremely pleased to be working with onforce to further build on the strong skills and qualifications their service professionals already have
5343652 comptia is the industry standard for technology education and certifications so they were the ideal partner for onforce in providing our community with best in class learning opportunities

5343657 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5343658 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5343659 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5343660 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5343704 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
5343705 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
5343706 the fastballs beckett threw ran back over the middle they were elevated
5343707 we spent the majority of the day doing that they were pretty consistent in scoring
5343708 stop me if you think youve heard this one before
5343709 the moment we put our boat on water and started the warm up i think everyone in the boat would agree we had absolute confidence in our ability to perform it was an absolutely incredible feeling
5343710 come on boys five more strokes and you guys are going to be olympic champions
5343711 you cross the finish line and youre completely exhausted completely tired but the thrill of victory erases the pain and suffering you endured during the race
5343712 we bond pretty tight because we spend so much time together we train three times a day six times a week we travel we room together and were really close
5343713 id say its a distant memory athens definitely hurt at the time when i think back to it but leading up to the race we didnt really think about it that much
5343714 we just recognized that we had a really excellent opportunity to perform and to seize gold and i guess having failed before and having worked that much longer for victory that makes reward that much more sweet
5343715 ich finde es klasse dass bmw sich in der heutigen zeit gedanken ber den umwelt und klimaschutz macht und eine gute kombination zwischen wenig spritverbrauch und schadstoffaussto entwickelt hat davon profitiert nicht nur der autofahrer sondern auch die ganze umwelt

5343735 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5343736 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5343737 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5343738 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups

5343740 ms barker was a pioneer in leading the fight against the riaas unwarranted making available theory and by challenging it and winning on that point she performed an important public service by helping to preserve the intent of the legislature in the us copyright act
5343741 and although ms barker did admit in her answer that she had used kazaa file sharing software i believe that she had important affirmative defenses which would have been successful
5343742 now that ms barker has laid down her sword and shield i hope other defendants will pick them up and carry them into battle

5343745 unvergesslichen und bewegenden feier die die ausdruckskraft originalit t und kraft der spiele von peking zelebriert hat
5343746 ich wollte heute abend unbedingt den weltrekord holen und bin so happy dass es geklappt hat
5343747 ich hoffe ich kann in peking in einen russischen hintern treten
5343748 die 4 70 meter waren knapp aber ich bin mit dem siebten rang bergl cklich
5343749 ich hoffe ich kann in peking in einen russischen hintern treten
5343750 ich habe mich wie eine s ngerin gef hlt die allein vor ihrem publikum stand
5343751 mein ziel sind 35 weltrekorde wie sie sergej bubka geschafft hat
5343752 ich denke dass ich bald h hen von 5 15 bis 5 20 meter springen kann es w rden dann etwa 35 oder 36 rekorde sein
5343753 and i think the writers made a very bold choice and took some risks with their writing and unfortunately it didnt connect with the audience as we thought it would
5343754 all of us humans have choices that we make and those choices lead us to the path of evil or good
5343755 this season is about villains becoming heroes and heroes becoming villains and what makes a villain and what makes a hero
5343756 and in order to do that and not have it be cheesy youve got to do it in a very organic way and i think its really cool and clever how the writers did it
5343757 the show certainly rivals if not betters the first season my character has always been on the outside looking in and this season he does find a way in and finds a way to understand these people but there are severe consequences to all of his actions and he goes down a really dark road
5343758 there is that dark side to all of us and there are these situations that will bring us either into the light or into the darkness and peter will have to battle his own demons and everything he fights so hard against
5343759 to be cut off is of course going to be jarring but i think it really did help the show
5343760 we had a tough season we had a tough year there was a lot of criticism as to what was going on with the characters and what was going on with the stories in retrospect i think the writers strike helped us stop assess and regroup and really get back to that sort of amazing fun heartfelt storytelling of the first season
5343761 las posibles implicaciones m s amplias para la estabilidad euroatl ntica
5343762 la sensaci n de velocidad dentro del habit culo es
5343763 nous ne permettrons jamais quon tue impun ment nos citoyens si on essaie nouveau la riposte sera crasante
5343764 nous avons toutes les ressources n cessaires politiques conomiques et militaires quiconque a encore des illusions ce sujet doit les abandonner
5343765 je peux dire avec certitude quand viendra le nouvel an mais je ne peux donner de date pr cise pour lach vement du repli de nos troupes de la zone de conflit

5343767 ne semons pas la discorde pour les g n rations futures
5343768 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix
5343769 the team has worked hard to prepare for this race because it is a new track for all of us but from a drivers point of view the important thing is to drive it for the first time and then you can start to understand more about the circuit i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that
5343770 even though this is a new track for us i know valencia pretty well from all the testing we have done at the other circuit there
5343771 it is a lively city and there always seems to be something going on so it should be a fun weekend i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5343772 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5343773 we have all the necessary resources political economic and military if anyone had any illusions about this they have to abandon them
5343774 dieser anschlag zeigt dass in unserer gesellschaft bei allen erfolgen die wir erreicht haben in dem prozess der anerkennung und der aufhebung von diskriminierung noch viel zu tun ist
5343775 er zeigt dass heute leider immer noch gek mpft werden muss um das was eigentlich selbstverst ndlich sein m sste dass jeder den anderen respektiert so wie er ist

5343777 mr mohamed had only recently joined us and of course somalia is an extremely dangerous part of the world anyway whether youre an aid worker or simply living in somalia he was traveling in a car that was not maked in any way it was a private car and he was not carrying out wfp duties
5343778 we make out of the quarrel with others rhetoric but of the quarrel with ourselves poetry
5343779 the obvious application for this spectrum is for internet connectivity everywhere all the time
5343780 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs
5343781 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5343782 so we took it upon ourselves to take advantage of that and go get it ourselves
5343783 white space opens that up it drops the cost of end user equipment it increases the ability of us to broadcast to not have intermediate repeating towers to support going through a grove of trees
5343784 because expanded access to the internet hopefully means more users using google and more users using google means more people hopefully clicking on the ads
5343785 changing the rate of a given type of business in the revenue during the next 3 years
5343786 improving it productivity of 5 during the next 3 years
5343787 its an historic opportunity and i think it hearkens back to the values people had when the wilderness act was first published in 1964
5343788 an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is a visitor who does not remain
5343789 were very concerned with this big mass push for wilderness thats going on right now
5343790 there are better choices in todays world for protecting that land and preserving the access thats so needed for recreation
5343791 chose to ignore wilderness proposals even when there was a great deal of consensus in support of them
5343792 to ensure that the land is preserved as god intended
5343793 you have ideal conditions for wind and solar energy across the state
5343794 starting the efforts in las vegas will help to to raise the capital
5343795 a can of red bull may not be a health risk
5343796 but three or four drinks would be the equivalent of sitting in a sauna or dancing on a dance floor
5343797 where you might see discussion or controversy we see potential opportunity
5343798 not going to make the world sustainable particularly when we have this big gorilla sitting out here called climate change that may be the problem of our generation and its closely followed by potable water food and the 4 billion people who live in poverty
5343799 the environmental community made a huge contribution in moving the industry in the early days
5343800 but many of them including greenpeace in the u s have petered out the smarter ones are looking at industry and helping it to change
5343801 what became clear to us in our strategic thinking process was that the world and the stakes were changing and changing very rapidly
5343802 the world had changed and our approach had not we started to think we needed some outside help
5343803 retailers had been pushed really into declaring a ban on pvc in the products they sold and in discussions it became clear that they didnt understand why
5343804 but the debate has moved on its no longer adequate simply to deal with the environment we must take into account economic and social development as well
5343805 intensively assessing our use of pvc and the viability of alternatives
5343806 what i found is that architects are bound by the questions that clients ask
5343807 i was hoping their questions would be about community and public benefit but many of them werent interested in those questions
5343808 weve expanded the definition of design to chemical products at the molecular scale
5343809 its our firm belief that we can get to the best answers if we dont jump to conclusions
5343810 rather than say one material is better or worse we help decisionmakers understand the options
5343811 i have no doubt that many of the firms in spc wouldnt be doing it without advocacy organizations legislators et cetera to push them there
5343812 advocacy organizations dont see it as their job to help with a solution their job is to identify a problem
5343813 this team has allowed us to gain more control over the quality and consistency of packaging and to directly affect everything from right sizing and minimizing packaging to using alternate raw materials
5343814 the engineers worked with one of our key packaging suppliers to develop a fully corrugated window box
5343815 we try to consider everything we dont just look at the quickest and cheapest way to make something we try to find the best way from a direction that does not negatively impact the consumer the worker or the environment
5343816 waste has more potential uses if the toxic footprint isnt too prohibitive
5343817 better selection of dyes and finishes can improve water quality
5343818 across many industries the environment is being taken more seriously
5343819 there is a greater realization that greener can be a business opportunity
5343820 it required more precise tooling different tack times and a change to process flow and times
5343821 critics should think about making certain uses of a chemical safer rather than trying to take out the chemical altogether
5343822 more than 95 of industrial products have chemicals in them if you want change youve got to have chemical companies that produce the alternatives
5343823 im really convinced we have done our homework on environmental health and safety issues
5343824 but basically i think these battles are the battles of the past
5343825 chemicals is the key industry that helps us meet the challenges of climate change and world food supply
5343826 at the time we were focused on our own footprint and we had a huge footprint
5343827 we spent most of the 1990s focused on this but after youve done that for a while you learn things business opportunities evolve we changed our focus from doing less bad to doing more good
5343828 we did a lot of work in the 1990s on energy efficiency it may have cost us money back then but its paying off big time now
5343829 one thing that the ngos have recognized is that companies that are financially successful will be able to do this kind of work
5343830 taking steps to improve their practices and that recognize that a change in policies that influence behavior are needed
5343831 but at least theres an effort to acknowledge that the landscape is changing and they need to be responsive to demands for more information
5343832 the jury may be out on the risk of bisphenol a
5343833 but the fact that we allowed a chemical into such widespread use while knowing so little about it that is the telling issue
5343834 that part of their business is too small to be taken seriously
5343835 manufacturers should get the message that theres a great deal of money to be made in green chemistry
5343836 but a lot of inertia exists in companies its ironic that companies that brag about their innovations and patents suddenly go into mode
5343837 dont use them as a place to dump chemicals you cant use in toys
5343838 your average consumer believes the chemical industry is the root of the problem and in some ways they have a lot of good evidence that thats the case
5343839 we need to take leadership and say the only way to maintain the quality of life we lead today and be sustainable is if the chemical industry provides solutions
5343840 its the biggest opportunity since the industrial revolution what better challenge for the chemical industry to step up to and lead instead of fight every regulation or every attempt by society to try to right the wrongs that some chemicals or poor uses of chemicals have led to
5343841 innovation is going to be absolutely critical to real progress in sustainability
5343842 its been innovation that in some ways has led to the buildup of many materials in society its going to be innovation from companies like rohm and haas that will change those materials in a way that makes the world more sustainable
5343843 energy demand is the single most critical challenge facing humanity
5343844 short of a worldwide catastrophe that wipes out billions of people science and technology will be required to find energy solutions
5343845 to inspire chemists to take on sustainability challenges questions and issues and make advances that will positively impact society and influence fields ranging from energy and pharmaceuticals to biomaterials and agrochemicals
5343846 sustainability is a beast that is hard for people to wrap their arms around
5343847 its hard to define sustainability in a single chemical concept or with a top 10 list as there are hundreds of areas that chemists and chemical engineers can work in that are related to issues of sustainability
5343848 but we still need to sharpen our attention to sustainability the connection between chemistry and sustainability needs to be stronger and all scientists need to be considering how to best translate their research into sustainable solutions
5343849 scientists need to be educated and educate others about sustainability to provide the molecular perspective that is important in evaluating the merits of chemical products and processes for their macroscale impact on society
5343850 the challenges of sustainability are among the most complex and daunting ever faced by society
5343851 it may well be that only by working at the most fundamental level the molecular level that we can address these complex global issues in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner
5343852 there are many things people can do to build a sustainable future
5343853 green chemistry is the part that chemists have to do
5343854 we need armies of students to go into fields of chemistry chemical engineering and materials science
5343855 they must learn how to make more sustainable products its our job to manipulate molecules and be at the front end to provide alternatives we are on the supply side of the sustainability curve
5343856 green chemistry does not stand for the old model of regulation that industry fears
5343857 regulation is a means of trying to fix something that is already broken
5343858 green chemistry and engineering is about making sure we dont create problems from the beginning we are attempting to make regulation obsolete co 2
5343859 but we cant let being perfect get in the way of being good enough and slow us down its better to get started learn as we go and make modifications along the way to be like nature and evolve nature is very good at keeping what works and getting rid of what doesnt work over time that is what we have to do as scientists and engineers to solve sustainability issues and green chemistry is a process a framework for helping us to do it
5343860 the more perspectives we can bring to the dialogue the more robust the solutions are going to be
5343861 green chemistry and engineering is about making sure we dont create problems from the beginning we are attempting to make regulation obsolete
5343862 no one is arguing that green chemistry alone will lead to sustainability
5343863 however with green chemistry as an essential guide the path toward sustainability can be traversed without the engagement of green chemistry the existence of a path is not clear
5343864 we still need to invent or reinvent the other 65
5343865 to show students how inefficient chemical processes in the fine chemicals industry actually are
5343866 fine chemicals and pharmaceutical firms always knew that their manufacturing processes were generating substantial quantities of waste
5343867 but putting a number to it via the concept of the e factor really brought the message home
5343868 the take home message is that water and some consumables usage could be reduced perhaps significantly if we pay attention to improving manufacturing technology
5343869 we can create a framework within which biologics manufacturing can be analyzed from a green technology and sustainability perspective
5343870 there are many things people can do to build a sustainable future green chemistry is the part that chemists have to do
5343871 chemists who are designing and creating new molecules generally do not receive any training in toxicology even though the chemicals they create ultimately may have unintended consequences on human health and the environment
5343872 our intent with the summit and follow up meetings is to remedy this situation by bridging the gap between chemistry and toxicology and harnessing the collective efforts of these two disciplines to design safer chemicals
5343873 this is a great opportunity to design and manufacture new products right the first time theres no compromise necessary we can have the high performance and technological advantages that we want using less expensive economically viable processes and materials that are greener and dont cause harm to human health and the environment and there are real solutions that are available right now to make this happen
5343874 it is not the energy per se but the services that we receive from energy that we value
5343875 the energy services that we value are heat to keep us warm electricity for light to let us see and to power thousands of gadgets and mobility to transport both ourselves and our goods around
5343876 free digital texts begin to challenge costly college textbooks in california
5343877 part of my initial focus is to transform our leading edge cargo dimming and security based systems into intelligent expert systems
5343878 these highly functional self diagnosing systems will be even more robust and informative than todays systems resulting in higher roi for our customers over the next 12 months we will be introducing an array of innovative solutions for every segment of the industry
5343879 there is no greater risk of being struck from the rear when the subject vehicle is maintaining less than two seconds than having greater than two seconds following distance
5343880 incidents involving the subject rear ending the lead vehicle where the subject vehicle had less than two seconds of following distance was almost three times as common as those where the driver was maintaining a distance of two seconds or greater
5343881 this is partially due to the fact that more of the roads had only one or two lanes of same direction traffic
5343882 however it may also be due to the fact that the center lane has fewer traffic flow disturbances

5343889 desenvolvimento de estudo e adequa o do projeto arquitet nico existente referente a edif cio em maring
5343890 but ought it to the answer is a fairly clear no
5343891 it should also give some room for thought in the united states as to how do we take care that our companies do not lag in this green revolution
5343892 if you are worried about job creation then maybe what ford is experiencing an us 8 7 billion loss in one quarter is not the trail to follow
5343893 ok scott we get it the cows dry move on
5343894 from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
5343895 he who is alone with his sin is utterly alone it may be that christians notwithstanding corporate worship common prayer and all their fellowship in service may still be left to their loneliness the final break through to fellowship does not occur because though they have fellowship with one another as believers and devout people they do not have fellowship as the undevout as sinners the pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner so everybody must conceal his sin from himself and from the felloowship we dare not be sinners many christians are unthinkably horrified when a real sinner is suddenly discovered among the righteous so we remain alone with our sin living in lies and hypocrisy the fact is we are sinners
5343896 but it is the grace of the gospel which is so hard for the pious to understand that it confronts us with the truth and says you are a sinner a great desperate sinner now come as the sinner you are to god who loves you
5343897 in confession the break through to community takes place sin demands to have a man by himself it withdraws him from the community the more isolated a person is the more destructive will be the power of sin over him and the more deeply he becomes involved in it the more disastrous is his isolation sin wants to remain unknown it shuns the light in the darkness of the unexpressed it poisons the whole being of a person in confession the light of the gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart the sin must be brought into the light the unexpressed must be openly spoken and acknowledged all that is secret and hidden is made manifest it is a hard struggle until the sin is openly admitted since the confession of sin is made in the presence of a christian brother the last stronghold of self justification is abandoned the sinner surrenders he gives up all his evil he gives his heart to god and he finds forgiveness of all his sins in the fellowship of jesus christ and his brother
5343898 im ok the enemy just found a way into our camp
5343899 britain has been strangely absent from the russo georgian conflict
5343900 to the extent that we have had anything to contribute we have contributed it through the council of europe and the eu
5343901 we have in other words been represented by nicolas sarkozy and while the french president has admirable qualities his interests are not identical to britains
5343902 the truth is that a common european foreign policy is already upon us britain could no more act unilaterally in georgia than in the world trade organisation
5343903 the eu has a foreign minister javier solana and an accompanying diplomatic corps known as the european external action service
5343904 the debate about whether or not there should be a common foreign policy is being conducted decades too late
5343905 n o h sinais at agora que as for as russas estejam se retirando

5343908 queria precisar termos existe o conceito de retirada e o de recuo na conversa do presidente da r ssia dmitri medvedev com o presidente da fran a nicolas sarkozy s se falou de recuo
5343909 espero que tenham percebido isto n o se trata de uma retirada
5343910 estamos convencidos de que dali gori n o emana nenhum perigo e por isto nos retiramos a partir de hoje

5343932 similar to mineral resources there is a continuum of resource grades from shallow high temperature regions of high porosity rock to deeper low porosity regions that are more challenging to exploit
5343933 so a global response to climate change must involve a move to carbon free sources of electricity
5343934 really youre blowing pieces of napkins at each other it seems kind of boring to me
5343935 didnt your mother ever let you have fun when you were a kid
5343936 why cant that lady with all the costumes and fun be my mommy
5343937 the man who really counts in the world is the doer not the mere critic the man who actually does the work even if roughly and imperfectly not the man who only talks or writes about how it ought to be done
5343938 ya nos ha ocurrido simplemente dejan de funcionar y se mueren
5343939 estamos tratando de comprender qu est ocurriendo dentro de este material de cerebro que pueda tener implicancias directas para la salud humana
5343940 es evidente que las neuronas han evolucionado para reconectarse bajo casi cualquier circunstancia que no las mate
5343941 yo los interpreto como un comportamiento de tipo apopl jico
5343942 creo que el estallido es una funci n de privaci n sensorial
5343943 sin un aporte sensorial estructurado la hip tesis es que se obtienen actividades arbitrariamente aleatorias y muy a menudo perjudiciales porque todas estas c lulas piden alguna clase de direcci n
5343944 parece que un est mulo sensorial est fijando el nivel b sico de actividad dentro del cerebro
5343945 una secuencia de pulsos el ctricos puede hacer que el cultivo cerebral cambie el comportamiento del robot
5343946 es como entrenar a un animal a hacer algo por incrementos graduales
5343947 este sistema es un modelo todo lo que hace es simplemente similar a lo que ocurre en un cerebro no es realmente lo mismo podemos aprender sobre el cerebro pero puede enga arnos
5343948 si esta clase de trabajo puede lograr una diferencia del 1 en la vida de un paciente de alzheimer valdr la pena
5343949 en la escala de distancia del radio nuclear es justo considerar a los antiprotones como part culas destructivas
5343950 la probabilidad de encontrarse dentro de una distancia tan peque a del n cleo es varios rdenes de magnitud m s peque a que la probabilidad de ser desviado
5343951 la gente no se da cuenta de cosas tan obvias hasta que realmente tropieza con algunos fen menos y piensa mucho en ellos
5343952 por un lado las acciones deber an ser las respuestas m s sensibles a los actuales valores del sensor
5343953 que son la manera m s natural de moverse y actuar
5343954 no sabe nada pero prueba los movimientos que son naturales para su cuerpo media hora despu s est rodando y saltando
5343955 usa la evoluci n artificial para alcanzar comportamientos pre especificados mientras nosotros usamos la pura auto organizaci n sin ninguna meta ni objetivo lo cual le da a cada agente una vida propia
5343956 estamos en la auto organizaci n del comportamiento de los robots desde el principio de modo que lo que obtenemos es esencialmente el robot juguet n
5343957 los resultados espec ficos como caminar aparecen s lo en los bocetos mientras que otros como las situaciones de lucha aparecen libremente
5343958 occasionally you have to get rid of someone whos not doing his or her job
5343959 i hate the washington dc approach you might hate the washington dc approach so why do you do the exact same thing this aint washington dc
5343960 they fired me because i didnt do my job thats a violation of my constitutional right to political favors or nepotism
5343961 citizens have no right to display political signs on their lawns

5343964 furthermore the recent cba and bendigo and adelaide bank results show clear upward pressure on retail deposit rates as a rated banks with less access to wholesale debt markets aggressively price retail deposit rates and the aa rated banks are forced to respond
5343965 after such a period of sustained underperformance relief rallies should be expected
5343966 maybe the olympics will burnish the chinese image for some but my takeaway from it so far is that
5343967 esta idea abre todo tipo de posibilidades sobre c mo interactuaremos con los dispositivos de esa clase
5343968 explica justin c s nchez uno de los autores del estudio
5343969 las mismas t cnicas de la terapia g nica pueden usarse no para curar enfermedades sino para modificar rasgos de la persona
5343970 y el deporte donde lo que se busca constantemente es mejorar es el mbito ideal para poner a prueba esta idea
5343971 para el tama o de los m sculos y la fuerza la hormona de crecimiento para la generaci n de sangre la hormona eritropoyetina epo
5343972 pero el entrenamiento de elite puede ser muy caro y estar incluso menos disponible que las sustancias que dopan
5343973 la llegada de nuevas formas de mejora humana en nuestro horizonte tecnol gico no implica como muchos han anunciado el fin de la humanidad es s lo el paso siguiente en el proceso continuado de la evoluci n humana
5343974 muchas terapias podr an resultar en mejoras adem s de en tratamientos ser a inaceptable su uso s lo porque son demasiado efectivas
5343975 una vez que la tecnolog a se haya demostrado segura renunciar a usarla tambi n es decidir sobre el patrimonio gen tico de nuestros descendientes espec ficamente es decidir que ellos no disfrutar n de sus beneficios si pudi ramos erradicar una enfermedad grave para las futuras generaciones y decidi ramos no hacerlo dudo que nuestros descendientes nos lo agradecieran
5343976 hoy d a se pueden generar c lulas madre a partir de c lulas de la piel y esas c lulas madre se pueden modificar gen ticamente de ellas se pueden generar c lulas germinales y a partir de ah es la rutina de la fertilizaci n in vitro cada uno de estos pasos se ha dado con ratones y en principio no veo que no se vaya a poder hacer con humanos
5343977 hoy nadie duda en mejorar el sistema inmune de sus hijos con vacunas una mejora de por vida irreversible y decidida por los padres no por el ni o adem s las vacunas funcionan porque seleccionan determinados cambios gen ticos en los genes responsables de la inmunidad por la misma raz n s sabemos y as lo hemos demostrado por ejemplo nosotros con ratones que introduciendo unas copias extra de un gen en lo que luego ser n espermatozoides u ovocitos podemos literalmente eliminar la posibilidad de c ncer o de alzheimer o de enfermedad cardiovascular y sin efectos secundarios por qu impedirlo
5343978 estamos muy lejos de la manipulaci n gen tica para la mejora cognitiva
5343979 produce un cambio permanente en la organizaci n funcional del cerebro que afecta al procesamiento de informaci n
5343980 la tica de negar un beneficio a unos pocos hasta que todos puedan disfrutar de l es dudosa
5343981 lo que nos hace humanos es la capacidad de dar forma a nuestro destino de acuerdo con nuestros deseos y la gen tica y las otras t cnicas de mejora nos proporcionan los medios para ello
5343982 gemeinsam mit den mitgliedern der nato entscheiden wann und wie es aufgenommen wird
5343983 wir gehen davon aus dass die vermeintlich betroffenen eine verschleppung nur vorget uscht haben
5343984 georgien wird wenn es das will und das will es ja mitglied der nato sein
5343985 f r mich hat sich die lage an dieser stelle nicht ver ndert
5343986 some open source companies have not truly figured that out
5343987 this is why you buy from me rather than my competitor and rather than taking it from me for free
5343988 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5343989 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5343990 superficies curvas o partes m viles como las juntas del brazo de un robot
5343991 we saw a range of all new mainframe clients this year across the world particularly in emerging markets such as china and india
5343992 many companies are facing both space and power constraints in their datacenters and are clamoring for increased datacenter efficiency
5343993 clients want datacenters that are designed for specific processes that can help them consolidate servers and improve their energy efficiency
5343994 the mainframe has been completely redesigned and is as modern if not more modern than any other platform out there
5343995 trusty mainframes are alive and kicking and remain critical components of a companys it infrastructure especially for mission critical high volume transactional environments like financial services where the mainframe has proven itself to be a trusted platform for housing large amounts of data in a secure and centrally managed environment
5343996 we suspect that much of this growth is coming from existing mainframe users who are either upgrading or growing their mainframe usage
5343997 scale up the performance of sophisticated data analysis and other bi functions against larger volumes of data
5343998 bi is still a growing market pushing the software onto the mainframe helps companies to both protect and leverage their mainframe investments that is using bi to drive legacy modernization without replacement of the mainframe
5343999 classic mainframe myths still exist today mainframes have traditionally been associated with high total cost of ownership lack of advanced applications inability to support real time low latency processing poor back end data integration support a shortage of mainframe skills and steep and inflexible development and maintenance curves
5344000 there are simply not enough young bright people wanting to learn mainframe skills over php java flash and other hip web 2 0 technologies

5344002 the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services in addition to being merely descriptive the applied for mark appears to be generic in connection with the identified services and therefore incapable of functioning as a source identifier for applicants services

5344009 la evoluci n en s misma no parece que pueda hacer los saltos creativos que han ocurrido en la historia de la vida
5344010 es un gran proceso a refinar jugar etc pero la auto organizaci n es el proceso necesario junto a la selecci n natural antes de que se obtenga esa clase del poder creativo que vemos a nuestro alrededor

5344013 the response of envys expansion into the various texas markets has been extremely successful and well received and were confident well have the same reception in austin

5344015 maybe the olympics will burnish the chinese image for some but my takeaway from it so far is that
5344016 fehlzeitstudie 2007 belegt dass trotz des gestiegenen durchschnittsalters im ffentlichen dienst die krankenstandsquote nur um einen halben tag h her als in der privatwirtschaft ist
5344017 wenn man davon ausgeht dass ltere mitarbeiter l ngere krankst nde aufweisen als junge kann der ffentliche dienst hier absolut mithalten mit der privatwirtschaft
5344018 es gibt statistisch gesehen auch keinen blauen montag im ffentlichen dienst
5344019 die krankenstandstage bewegen sich nicht rund um den montag und freitag sondern sind gleichm ig verteilt
5344020 umso h her die qualifikation umso niedriger sind die krankenst nde
5344021 ich glaube aber auch dass die reformen unter schwarz blau nicht zur motivation der polizistinnen beigetragen haben
5344022 es muss das ziel eines vorgesetzten sein dass die mitarbeiterinnen gesund sind denn nur dann bringen sie volle leistung und fehlen nicht

5344046 brinker international will retain a minority ownership position in order to both maximize the value to brinkers shareholders and contribute to the success of macaroni grill as a stand alone entity

5344087 at a time when students with disabilities in new york are succeeding and meeting the same rigorous regents requirements as their non disabled peers it would be nothing short of immoral to derail their progress by passing an election year gimmick that would only harm our public education system and fail to bring any meaningful tax relief to new yorkers

5344102 whether it was voting against or voting present on issues related to stricter penalties on offenders of serious crimes or disallowing citizens to exercise their right to self defense obama demonstrated poor judgment on an important issue to his constituents
5344103 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5344104 im sure many of you will also recall from your experiences in war as i do from mine that when youre somewhere on the other side of the world in the service of america you pay attention to the news from back home
5344105 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president says mccain
5344106 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5344107 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen
5344108 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5344109 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5344110 i am leaving with satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did that with honesty
5344111 i am a human too i could have made mistakes i believe that the people will forgive me and if there were any shortcomings or any mistakes they were unintentional

5344113 were betting against it in part because he under performed as a presidential contender this year perhaps more so because james carvilles judas comment about him fair or not would simply add to the hillary clinton related headahces for no drama obama
5344114 intriguing he notes is obamas planned stop wednesday in martinsville va
5344115 what better place for obama to unveil virginia gov tim kaine as his choice
5344116 forfeit victory in iraq than forfet his election as president
5344117 surge of u s forces has done its job in iraq
5344118 hes got a lot longer track record than the 2004 campaign against sen
5344119 hes a legendary entrepreneur and one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5344120 everybody knows if we keep on going on the same track that were going and we are giving our wealth away were funding both sides of the war on terror
5344121 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5344122 barack obama knows we havent had a czechoslovakia for the last 20 years he knows that pakistan and iraq doesnt sic border each other he has shown now not only good judgment but hes shown the kind of ability you have to have to make the tough decisions you have to make as president of the u s
5344123 it is a fairy tale that the u s defense shield missiles would be aimed at pariah states
5344124 i think its very loose rhetoric and i think its unnecessary and frankly its empty rhetoric
5344125 the russians arent going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody because 10 defensive missile interceptors are located in poland so i think some of the leadership of russia needs to get a better handle on the leadership of some of the folks there
5344126 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5344127 pro life presidency he said so at the saddleback church in california last night
5344128 pro choice running mate such as former pennsylvania gov tim ridge right
5344129 my friend of 25 years is passionately pro life ridge said on f
5344130 he is also passionately a believer that the republican party must have a big tent
5344131 and i think frankly what he was just saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view ridge told foxs chris wallace today
5344132 hes not judgmental about me or my belief said ridge who also served as the first homeland security secretary under president bush and like mccain is a decorated war veteran and popular in a state where democrat barack obama apparently holds a narrow advantage over mccain
5344133 he just disagrees with me and theres no doubt in my mind no doubt whatsoever that there would be he would have a strong pro life administration no question about it

5344135 making voluntary contributions is a no brainer if you havent built up enough to get a full state pension when you retire
5344136 whether it is women who have had career breaks for children or anybody who has worked overseas for a considerable period buying back years is the most cost effective form of pension saving you can make
5344137 most people think 84 a week or 4 400 a year is nothing but they dont realise how much money they need to get this income when they are retired

5344140 unfortunately toronto doesnt lend itself as well to tailgating as some of the other nfl stadiums so were making the best of it
5344141 were taking what is a very singular you and your buddies sort of experience and creating a big party which is a bit of a different take
5344142 our audience is not america its the whole world theres only one word in the whole world that everyone understands sex you type the word sex you come to sex com
5344143 i thought it was a valuable piece of real estate
5344144 because we do not have a direct connection to the internet we request that you notify the internet registration sic on our behalf to delete our domain name sex com further we have no objections to your use of the domain name sex com and this letter shall serve as our authorization to the internet registration to transfer sex com to your corporation
5344145 its like someone forging the title to your house and then taking it over
5344146 its up to the two parties to work it out
5344147 he called and said he was a lawyer from the patent and trademark office and that i had no case
5344148 anything thats of a legal nature has to go through the attorneys
5344149 i thought that i made that real clear to you

5344151 at present the company is negotiating the acquisition of an entire island in the caribbean for the purpose of developing the ultimate fantasy island
5344152 imagine being able to buy your own condominium on fantasy island
5344153 but they didnt know their ass from a hole in the ground it was a little bit like me deciding to build an atom bomb when all ive got is the casing
5344154 he went around and threatened to sue a bunch of people who had sex in their domain name and a bunch of people gave him their domains
5344155 they were intimidated he basically strong armed them the guy is really kind of a scumbag
5344156 it cost me money to defend myself and it cost me a lot of grief eventually i decided it aint worth the fight
5344157 weve got lawsuits filed left and right for trademark infringement
5344158 were constantly filing new lawsuits constantly we have teams of lawyers at ocean fund who do nothing but file lawsuits
5344159 owns a whole ton of businesses everything from banking to hotels construction to sex
5344160 the depositors are happy with the returns but they dont want to know where its coming from
5344161 the companies dont exist except in name he created these shell corporations with p o boxes in other countries so its a real pain in the ass to serve him with subpoenas
5344162 nothing more than a hodgepodge of general and conclusory allegations thrown together with a generous portion of scandalous and irrelevant allegations directed primarily against defendant cohen for good measure
5344163 four years after it allegedly acquired ownership of the domain name sex com
5344164 online classifieds allegation that it was the owner of the sex com url has no basis in fact and is tantamount to perpetrating a fraud
5344165 thats not necessarily an argument that will hold up in every court microsoft got its domain for free does that mean it has no valid contract
5344166 its terrible its a major drain of attention and money
5344167 we wanted it to be kind of cute a fun thing to go to but we didnt want it to be cheesy
5344168 but can only put that in peoples books when its december and even then i always have to ask whether theyre christians as there really is no way that i know of to say
5344169 but i might just be able to get you some expert help with the gaelic
5344170 it is a members only event there is no charge for members however if someone wants to attend they can become a member two ways go to our web site and sign up there or pay at the door however both ways they must make a reservation so we know how many people are attending lowest membership fees are 20 a year for seniors and students 25 for others or a family membership for a couple with children 35 reservations 602 534 5208

5344179 the democrat party is ours we bought it and paid for it
5344180 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5344181 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5344182 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5344183 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5344184 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5344185 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5344186 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5344187 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5344188 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses
5344189 they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5344190 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5344191 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5344192 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5344193 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5344194 and i will not accept a situation in which veterans are denied access to care on account of travel distances backlogs of appointments and years of pending disability evaluation and claims we should no longer tolerate requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in one line for a ticket to stand in another
5344195 japan played very well they forced us to play the way we did and the good part about that is the way they knock it around and even though they scored first we stayed focused and we believed in what we were doing
5344196 we bounced back we dont have one star we have 18 it is a great feeling with these players on and off the pitch
5344197 we all knew we had to pick it up the team concentration is awesome and its all coming together
5344198 we lost to the usa four years ago in athens so we prepared for four years
5344199 although we lost tonight we made it into the top four which took us 10 years we lost tonight but we will maintain our dream of beating the usa
5344200 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5344201 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5344202 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5344203 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5344204 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5344205 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5344206 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5344207 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5344212 its monday or tuesday or thursday or friday and everyone knows thats the worst day to call anyone ill do it tomorrow
5344213 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
5344214 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5344215 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
5344216 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
5344217 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
5344218 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
5344219 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got

5344224 since frank wren and i both know how much people generally dont enjoy undergoing season ending surgery to begin with but we figured better safe than sorry
5344225 we dont want to see one player on the dl next year after this
5344226 season ending surgery must be a tough thing to going through
5344227 and it was so very kind of dr andrews to coming all the way out here to making us feel better about the whole process i feeling so much better about next year already i hitting ball gooder then
5344228 we feel this is the best direction to take the team
5344229 we talked it over and it was tough but it was just a matter of investing in our team and showing our guys how much we care about their health we told the guys the season ending surgeries were an early christmas present

5344241 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5344242 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5344243 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5344244 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5344245 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5344246 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5344247 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5344248 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5344249 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5344250 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5344251 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5344252 camera phones have already proven their worth within the news business
5344253 he was a very tall glass of water a string bean
5344254 he was a very tall kid and he was very awkward his ears were a little big people would tease him which was very difficult for michael
5344255 speaks of the immense hurt he was caused for his ears and how he used it as motivation to become the greatest olympian
5344256 michael phelps superstar what grace what style and what a set of magnificent ears
5344257 you might not think it but everything that comes up michael uses for motivation and look where its taken him
5344258 you had a laughter of grapes many loud green laughs
5344259 and hopes come to me like bold seafarers like the discoverers of continents coming to an island and stay for a day or two and rest and then they set sail
5344260 i was pretty fortunate to play on some pretty good teams with some pretty good players in my time but thats been a long time ago i havent even been around a football since 1972
5344261 it wasnt always this way but when i got to ohio state in 1960 woody was under a tremendous amount of pressure
5344262 he had won a national championship a couple of years before that but then people got to expecting that every year the year before i got there they had a losing season and that was just unheard of so it was very tough playing for woody in those days because he was really pressing
5344263 but i can also tell you that he wanted every one of his players to do the work that was necessary in the classroom he always said that if you go to ohio state and dont get a degree youve cheated yourself
5344264 now in my family i was the first to go to college i was the first one to graduate from high school but i didnt have good study habits i guess i was like most football players in that i just wanted to do enough to get by so i could play football
5344265 woody wouldnt have that he placed a tremendous emphasis on education and it was tough for me in the early going but that education meant everything to me after football and after me all of my family has gone to college i like to think that i set that standard for them and im proud of that but part of that was because woody challenged me to get that education
5344266 of course in those days there was no bowl if you werent going to the rose bowl
5344267 but i guess beating michigan three times and beating them in your last game is a pretty good way to go out
5344268 the giants had taken another running back joe don looney in the first round
5344269 they also still had frank gifford and alex webster and they wanted me to come in sit behind them and learn for a year or two i didnt want to do that i think you learn by doing and i saw the jets as an opportunity to play right away
5344270 we really had no fear of baltimore in that game
5344271 baltimore played a zone defense in the secondary that we knew we could beat we really thought very early in the week that we were going to win that game
5344272 when tight end pete lammons stood up and told jets head coach weeb ewbank dont show us any more of that were going to get overconfident i guarantee well beat those guys
5344273 a day later joe is out at some function and says the same thing of course he said it in public and thats when it hit the newspapers
5344274 that made three years in a row that i would have had to rehab the entire offseason
5344275 in those days we had to have other jobs in the offseason to supplement our incomes i just figured i was 32 years old and tired of rehabbing i just decided to hang it up
5344276 thats when i bought my daughter there to look at the campus she was getting ready to go to college and she was talking about all the places she was interested in i told her she had to at least go look at ohio state and she did
5344277 it was a really nice visit and i enjoyed it very much im usually not one to look back but that was real nice
5344278 were going to get this together im convinced of that were going to do it

5344290 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
5344291 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5344292 there seems to be absolutely no basis for this charge
5344293 in 2007 we measured a 23 percent increase in visits to the market and this grant is going to let us continue that work in a much bigger way we dont have the resources to do main stream conventional advertising and this grant will allow us to do that
5344294 theres a considerable distance between a religious test for public office and a voters inspection of a candidate
5344295 i believe in the separation of church and state but i do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is simply a worldview and everybodys got a worldview

5344297 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world
5344298 this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts it is slightly daunting but i am really excited at the same time
5344299 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5344300 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy
5344301 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity
5344302 they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5344303 when we heard that ray aced both his sat and act i just thought this is incredible getting a perfect score in just one of these college entrance exams is nearly impossible but to get perfect score on both ray is an exceptional young man
5344304 the will to win is meaningless without the will to prepare

5344306 if you are bored with life if you dont get up every morning with a burning desire to do things you dont have enough goals

5344316 if youre a bad guy and you try to get between me and the safety and lives of american citizens youre going to lose
5344317 for me it is a logical progression to go from serving ones country in the armed serves to serving ones country in a different uniform a civilian suit
5344318 because you have taken an oath to the constitution and you know what it means to sacrifice for the country and you believe in something that is bigger than yourself
5344319 weve got to get back to the basic conservative principles
5344320 understanding our national security fiscal conservatism social conservatism and tying ourselves to what it is in the constitution
5344321 if its about the lives of my men and their safety id go through hell with a gasoline can
5344322 to make sure we are setting up our soldiers and airman and marines for success on the ground instead of having them in these situations where they can be exploited by the enemy
5344323 they are in a quandary about who they are and what they want to be as opposed to what we saw in 1994 when they took over with the contract with america
5344324 as long as you are blocking and tackling you win but when you start getting to the point where youre shifting and changing your positions too often people start to lose confidence in you
5344325 because i stay on the same basic themes same basic message
5344326 we have to go to the issues and talk about the basic conservative principles which promote individual rights and freedom individual responsibility and accountability of american citizens and i think thats where you win
5344327 its the same as saying world war ii was about fighting blitzkrieg
5344328 weve got to define this enemy and be very clear about understanding its goals and objectives
5344329 when you have groups that are unindicted co conspirators in terrorist activities that should alarm you
5344330 when you have such propaganda that is going through mosques all through this country when you have people that are talking against our constitution and our constitutional democracy and way of life thats got to cause you some nervousness
5344331 its about promulgating a different political system that is contrary to what we have here which is individual rights and freedoms and respect thereof
5344332 weve got to deny the enemy sanctuary wherever he seeks to establish his terrorist activities and training camps
5344333 weve got to interdict the flow of his men and materiel and financial support weve got to isolate and we have to contain his ideology not allow it to spread and confront our way of life and then the last thing is we have to disrupt his worldwide operations
5344334 that advantage does not translate into anything other than the fact that he can put a bad message out on tv more than me right now
5344335 all that congressman klein can do is to regurgitate nancy pelosis talking points
5344336 he cannot come up with any type of sound solution on his own he has to stay within the democratic agenda which as we see right now is nothing but more attacks and spin doubling the capital gains tax increasing the estate tax increasing the payroll tax on people earning 200 000 or more not coming up with any solution for our energy situation
5344337 what happened in 2006 is the combination of republicans acting more like democrats not being fiscally conservative and not holding up to their standards
5344338 not beholden to a lot of standards so they will do certain things and theyll say so what
5344339 heres someone caught with 90 000 in marked bills in the freezer and hes still a congressman hes in a leadership position hes going to run for office again
5344340 the american people are looking for conservatives to be people of standards and principles and to hold to them
5344341 every time you were promoted as an officer you re took your oath to the constitution because thats what you were there to support and defend
5344342 the constitution is the embodiment of the american people so as long as you understand that you are a servant to the american people as long as you understand that basic document and what it is calling you to do you wont change
5344343 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5344344 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5344345 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5344346 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5344347 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5344348 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5344349 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5344350 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5344351 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5344352 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5344353 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5344356 the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth
5344357 software as a service cloud computing service oriented architecture web 2 0 and open source software are causing huge changes to the software market
5344358 many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services

5344371 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

5344385 why is it important to you that you can work here
5344386 well i am a perfectionist i must have all my work complete and beautiful
5344387 i work long hours and can tire myself when i get caught up in an exciting project i really value firms that track overtime hours and give me an extra day off from time to time to acknowledge those long days and let me recharge my batteries
5344388 i have very high standards and when i was younger every client got a cadillac even if we bid a pinto i have learned the importance of requirements and project plans to keep my work in scope and make sure i solve the problem we are tackling in the time we have allowed but its still a weakness that i can be vulnerable to scope creep
5344389 i think very quickly and solve problems faster than most people but i can forget to make sure my colleagues are with me and that we have consensus i work best in an atmosphere where at least one person can keep up when my mind takes off and remind me to explain my thoughts to everyone
5344390 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5344391 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5344392 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together

5344824 we are not grand but we are the edinburgh festival
5344825 the good thing about having a concept a theme an idea that tries to bind the festival together is that every year you have to come up with a new one
5344826 that i think is a great challenge and its a point of difference from brian mcmaster millss predecessor whose approach to the festival was very much about creating a family of collaborators thats not me deliberately distinguishing myself from brian it just sort of evolved
5344827 it was not my intention to force my thesis on people
5344828 its not just about having a palestinian theatre or having a hungarian orchestra
5344829 its been about trying to find the projects that can elucidate this theme

5344831 people have suggested and i think its a kind of tokenistic idiocy really that it only shows how relevant your theme was for this year
5344832 well the world is fragile the world has always been fragile and the world of make believe the world of artists is especially fragile in an already fragile ecosystem
5344833 i dont see that as helpful it does not help address the concerns that individual lives have and i think what festivals can do at their best is bring people together to share understanding of other cultures cultures that seem strange and alien and removed from our own
5344834 a lot of work had been done behind the scenes in preparation so the arguments werent new
5344835 but it was a new person making them and a new person from a long way away saying that edinburgh would need to look very carefully at its festivals in order to maintain them
5344836 if youre not thinking about your programming in different ways then youre not growing as an organisation
5344837 theres no doubt that theres been a vast change in the approach and ideas of programming of this festival even in two years the range of what were doing

5345123 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5345124 were so used to hearing helen ask questions that i wanted it to be about us questioning her with the film exclusively coming from her voice

5345148 brinker international will retain a minority ownership position in order to both maximize the value to brinkers shareholders and contribute to the success of macaroni grill as a stand alone entity
5345149 operating results at macaroni grill could continue to deteriorate due to the challenging consumer macro environment and competitive forces
5345150 and will continue to distract management to some level from focusing on the core business and remaining brands
5345151 the recent bull run in commodities was based more on investment demand than the fundamentals of the world economy
5345152 they exacerbate peaks and troughs in the long run they have less of an impact than in the short run but in the short run people die
5345153 did you see a huge increase in use of petroleum products no
5345154 did peak oil happen no we didnt have a crisis that warranted this 150 oil
5345155 the impact of those folks coming onto the scene was greater than the effect of speculative investors
5345156 people in the know saw that paper assets stocks and bonds would get into serious trouble
5345157 they figured the only safe haven was tangible assets there was a complete panic out of paper and into physical assets they moved not for speculation but for protection
5345158 after a while the trend stops going one way this time it turned around with particular vengeance
5345159 i wouldnt be surprised if this commodity effect lowers food prices maybe in the fourth quarter
5345160 those people do not like to stand in front of steamrollers that are running downhill they all can turn on a dime
5345161 i am pleased to have met with colleagues to discuss this important issue for the future of hastings young people we have had a very productive meeting and have come to a unified position on the academies plan
5345162 let me be absolutely clear lib dems are for excellence choice and comprehensive education we are also for a whole systems approach to education but the academies plan presents us with fundamental problems
5345163 we are opposed to the removal of democratic accountability and we are opposed to any sort of sham consultation we want the ninestiles project to be given the countys full backing and for the superhead model to be maintained
5345164 we know that we need a step change in the quality of secondary education in hastings but the labour government is determined to impose its academies model from the centre and the conservative county council appears to be rolling over and accepting it
5345165 liberal democrats want the best for local children we want the best staff and the best leadership for our schools but we do not believe that this will come via an academies model which has no real track record
5345166 i understand that tens of millions will be spent on this latest initiative
5345167 i am sure that local teachers could provide fantastic outcomes with that kind of investment and without introducing a model which has in the small print permission for 10 pupil selection
5345168 local people must ask what will happen to those who dont get selected what will be the impact for them and for their families
5345169 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5345170 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about

5345186 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5345187 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5345188 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5345189 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5345190 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5345191 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5345192 we really want to get the message out to people
5345193 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment

5345195 the first three seasons of a1gp have shown the cars to be remarkably safe protecting the drivers and allowing them to survive some major impacts

5345241 your site is outstanding and very informative i live here in la and have been hoping to one day find an area with cleaner air in particular i had been looking at bellingham and enjoyed reading of your experiences there your writing style is excellent and a real pleasure to read of the many sites out there a truly useful site looking forward to reading about your next journey towards finding a clean air location
5345242 i came across your blog and found your site to be a very interesting read thanks for what you do to bring clean healthy air issues to light
5345243 your blog on the clean air and your trip to the monterey peninsula is wonderfully written bravo to you on a fine piece of writing and with great photos
5345244 the m1800r was launched just over two years ago and has proved a huge success while it offered exceptional power and styling we have been missing a model designed for covering larger distances on and so its great to be able to offer the c1800rt in the uk with its relaxed riding position and additional touring kit its the perfect cruiser to cover vast distances on in comfort
5345245 i love germany and i love the n rburgring it was here in 2007 that we picked up our first one two of the season and weve gone and done the same again this time round this result is a fantastic reward for the whole team theyre all delighted after finishing second and third at le mans it was important for peugeot to win this weekend and take the lead in both the manufacturers and drivers championships the title will finally be decided at silverstone we preferred to let our crews fight it out between themselves here because it was too early to start thinking in terms of strategy for the drivers title we took our decision out of respect for our drivers who all put in great performances again despite the traffic as well as for sporting reasons we didnt want to influence the outcome this is a great result not only for our brand but also for the psa group which scored two one two finishes in germany with citro n taking first and second in the countrys round of the wrc
5345246 our race plan went perfectly we stayed with our incisive strategy of starting strongly in order to pull out a gap and we lapped our closest rivals at the halfway point so as not to lose the benefit of our hard work should the safety car come out the aerodynamic set up of the 2008 sprint spec 908 proved very competitive
5345247 i am proud of our performance for peugeot today it was very important to get both cars to the finish with a view to scoring championship points and after junes le mans 24 hours it was also important for st phane and me to get back onto the podium theres nothing like winning i am really delighted with this result because there were no team orders which goes to show what a sporting team peugeot is
5345248 its a fantastic result for us and for the whole team our car was perfectly balanced and the mechanics did a terrific job which enabled us to claim our second win of the year following our victory at monza we had a good fight with the n 7 car and there was never much in it so nobody could afford to make a mistake
5345249 we lost a lot of time in the traffic especially behind the lola aston martin that cost us the lead and we then dropped a further 30 seconds to the n 8 car when we had a small problem with the starter
5345250 this result is very positive for us in terms of the drivers championship it was nice to start from pole position and we also posted the fastest race lap the title decision will now go down to the wire at silverstone which is a circuit i love
5345251 from country to mariachi to gutbucket blues unified by cooders raspy vocals and his lyrical guitar playing light on flash heavy on feeling

5345261 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5345262 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5345263 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5345264 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5345265 if i am elected president they will have that support
5345266 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5345267 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5345268 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia

5345286 grecia tiene un equipo s lido con un buen bloque pero creo que estamos bien contra grecia ellos tienen un estilo de juego diferente al nuestro y el que imponga su juego tendr la ventaja

5345289 the new orleans disastrously low performing school system was almost entirely washed away in the flood many of the buildings were destroyed the school board was taken over and all the teachers were fired what is being built in its place is an educational landscape unlike any other a radical experiment in reform more than half of the citys public school students are now being educated in charter schools publicly financed but privately run and most of the rest are enrolled in schools run by an unusually decentralized and rapidly changing school district
5345290 katrina struck at a critical moment in the evolution of the contemporary education reform movement
5345291 in 2000 in a book titled it takes a city researchers laid out a new architecture for urban school reform that they called the diverse providers strategy under this model local school boards wouldnt run a school system hierarchically the way they usually did instead they would oversee a portfolio of schools some run directly by the board and many run on contract by nonprofits universities or private companies schools would receive money on a per student basis and principals could then use that money to staff their schools as they liked and pay for whatever instructional methods they chose each school would negotiate salaries and work rules directly with its teachers

5345410 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5345411 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5345412 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5345451 there are things that we can pick up with an electrocardiogram or with echocardiography that we may need to follow and in some cases could be career ending

5345512 in the last week two major pillars of president bushs approach to foreign policy have crumbled jeopardizing eight years of work and sending the administration scrambling for new strategies in the waning months of its term
5345513 from the earliest days of his presidency bush had said spreading democracy was a centerpiece of his foreign policy
5345514 and in pursuing both these major goals bush relied heavily on developing what he saw as strong personal relationships with foreign leaders

5345536 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5345537 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5345538 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5345539 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5345540 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5345541 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5345542 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5345543 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5345544 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5345545 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5345546 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5345547 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5345548 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5345549 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5345550 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5345559 re re re utilities what do you pay i know exactly what you mean i used to live in my parents old rental when we moved out
5345560 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5345561 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5345562 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5345573 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5345574 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5345575 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5345576 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5345577 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile

5345813 because your wife embezzled his life savings and threatened to frame him for it if he ever revealed it
5345814 card argues that the morality of an act is based solely on the intentions of the person acting
5345815 but no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law which are written in the conscience of every man the promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense as can external pressures or pathological disorders sin committed through malice by deliberate choice of evil is the gravest
5345816 it also happens to be readable by kids though there is some crude language in it largely related to flatulence which as card points out in an afterword to the audio book edition is inescapable if you want to write realistically about boys

5345823 i think there is justification for caution the people should be extra careful in areas where conflicts took place but rest assured that government forces are already in place and they are making sure that residents will be well guarded

5345830 this package will make a difference to many couples but i cant guarantee that it will solve our problem because it is a deep problem
5345831 i am determined to pursue god ordained passions until the day i die life is too precious to settle for anything else im not convinced that your date of death is the date carved on your tombstone most people die long before that we are dying when we have nothing worth living for and we dont really start living until we find something worth dying for ironically discovering something worth dying for is what makes life worth living
5345832 jesus never promised safety or certainty or predictability and he certainly didnt die on the cross to tame us he died to make us dangerous he died to invite us into a life of spiritual adventure and if you will have the courage to come out of the cage and chase the wild goose life will turn into another day another adventure

5345844 without government help we think there is very little chance of freddie completing a significant capital raising
5345845 as the secretary has said we have no plans to use these authorities
5345846 they really are helping to pull the market down rather than being source of strength at this time
5345847 they are going to be pressed to raise capital in a very weak market which is going to make the cost of capital very high for both of these organizations

5345876 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5345877 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5345878 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5345879 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5345886 setting a legal precedent in a unanimous vote that clarifies that commonly used practices cannot be considered humane simply because they are widely used will build on our momentum in challenging the cruel status quo on factory farms
5345887 standards for the humane raising keeping care treatment marketing and sale of domestic livestock
5345888 having the new jersey supreme court unanimously recognize that the mutilation practices commonly used in the industry cutting off the beaks and toes of live animals without anesthesia is painful to these animals is an important milestone in educating the public at large about these practices and the need for reform
5345889 this decision will protect thousands of animals in new jersey and also calls into question some of the worst factory farm abuses practiced throughout the country
5345890 all animals deserve humane treatment including animals raised for food
5345891 revision joint replacement and bilateral surgery are much more prolonged operations than primary unilateral joint replacement
5345892 these findings suggest an increased risk with more prolonged surgery

5345900 the successful completion of the refinancing and establishment of the long term funding platform ensures that baa has the right financial structure to deliver our ambitious investment program to expand airport capacity build new facilities and provide a better service to passengers and airlines
5345901 in doing so we will be better positioned to serve our customers with the products they need manufactured at the right location for the customer and delivered when they need them
5345902 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5345903 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5345904 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5345905 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5345906 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5345907 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5345908 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5345909 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5345910 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5345916 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5345917 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5345918 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5345919 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5345920 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5345921 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5345922 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5345923 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5345924 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5345925 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5345926 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5345927 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5345928 educational i would think that it would be just wonderful but then umm there is much to learn about being home much to adjust in my lifestyle
5345929 umm i have to take things a little more seriously by way of doing things related to the way in which i am being paid in other words i have to take things seriously and not poke fun at it

5345932 cause the result of doing it is taking up an immense amount of time
5345933 it makes everything seem more realistic so therefore the words i come up with have bigger impact
5345934 it does tire me out but it is fascinating and leads to more important questions

5345950 with reported july sales results and recently updated guidance we expect generally inline second quarter earnings results
5345951 we continue to believe children and teen retailers fared better than missy and men and expect this pattern to continue throughout the year
5345952 importantly we believe most retailers ended the second quarter with healthy inventory positions which should bode well for back to school
5345953 though gas prices have declined in recent weeks inflationary pressure and overall higher costs of living lead us to remain cautious with our second half outlook

5345955 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5345956 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5345957 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5345958 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5345959 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5345960 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5345961 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5345962 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5345963 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5345964 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5345965 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5345966 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5345967 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5345968 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5345969 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5345970 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5345971 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5345974 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5345975 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5345976 i believe that the federal government should stay out of peoples private lives as well as respect the laws and desires of each state in our country for that reason i do not support the federal government legislating on the topic of marriage
5345977 gay couples should be given the opportunity to enter into contractual arrangements as anyone however the federal government should not be forced to recognize civil unions that are attempts at marriage by another name
5345978 while states have historically set the rules regarding marriage i believe that marriage is a union of a woman and a man due to my beliefs about marriage as a member of congress i voted for the constitutional amendment that protects marriage as a union of a woman and a man
5345979 it is very very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter

5345995 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms john mccain has ten houses many working people in america have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in america has quality affordable health insurance

5345999 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5346000 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5346001 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5346002 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5346003 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5346004 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5346005 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5346006 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5346007 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5346055 we also know that the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps heat in the earths atmosphere
5346056 from there it is fairly simple to deduce that co2 might actually be blinding gods

5346060 ironically as soon as you start talking about those off the wall schemes its normally when the market starts to correct itself its a bit of a case of murphys law
5346061 you need to be careful in terms of urging policy makers to respond
5346062 its not flash if youre an existing property owner but the end game here is that house prices are going to become more affordable
5346063 you could argue instead of being more affordable its slightly less unaffordable
5346064 there is plenty of room for local and central government to change the way they do things to make it easier for people to buy and live in houses
5346065 i thought id been quite hard done by it was a fail but when i sent it back it got marked up to a normal scholarship pass
5346066 i was really stoked when it came back with a positive result but also a little annoyed that it hadnt been marked properly the first time
5346067 no marking system is perfect never has been the fact that we have a back up system where things can be looked at again is very positive
5346068 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5346069 while both of these members are clearly grandstanding in a vain attempt to revive flagging popularity and impending obscurity this is a serious matter and should be treated as such
5346070 from the outset let me declare that i reject any claim of contempt of parliament the facts simply dont support the claims which have been levelled
5346071 the assertion that i knowingly breached standing orders by not disclosing the situation of multi millionaire owen glenn paying legal costs does not make sense the blunt fact is there is and was no debt
5346072 the number of hispanics responding to text message advertisements has increased by 20 percent in the past year
5346073 univisions audience is among the most loyal and mobile marketing is an ideal way to build even stronger relationships
5346074 this partnership takes our reach into the hispanic marketplace to a whole new level and provides an increasingly attractive platform for brands that are looking to engage the hispanic consumer
5346075 the standardization of video ad formats by the iab was a critical first step in streamlining media buying planning and creative processes across the digital video medium
5346076 our research was a result of our desire to provide data about the effectiveness of those new standards to our clients and partners and to lay a foundation for future research initiatives to build and expand upon
5346077 for the in stream advertising market to evolve the efficacy of ad formats whether iab standard or new emerging formats needs to be understood in order for our industry to scale
5346078 this research begins to fill the knowledge gap between the formation of standards and the prophetic future of an efficient and scalable online advertising industry
5346079 our new pay system removes the link between meeting sales targets and getting pay increases it is good for staff and customers
5346080 there are still aspects of the sales target system we want to see changed but this is a very important step in the right direction
5346081 i think for all companies its because of cheap imports
5346082 its like a family being broken up they can see amounts of clothing coming through were getting less and less but its not till you actually hear the manager saying the words then it hits home
5346083 were seeing fluctuating volumes in our express package business on a month by month basis
5346084 its very difficult to read the future other than to say express package will deliver sound performance overall
5346085 but its going to be a very tough year ahead for them as it will be for a lot of new zealand companies
5346086 last year was not a great year for our shareholders
5346087 if you owned 100 of shares on april 1 2007 you would have had that value reduced to 83 50 by march 31 this year
5346088 not only is infratil in a sound financial position it has invested in sectors which are in the main not adversely impacted by the world wide credit difficulties or general adverse economic circumstances
5346089 resulted in a lot more people flying a lot more frequently
5346090 that is despite a recession and the main reason for that is the competition that has been introduced by pacific blue
5346091 while we would like to see farm gate returns improve more this will be a vast improvement on the previous season which is on record as the lowest sheep and beef farm profit in at least 50 years in inflation adjusted terms
5346092 there remains uncertainty in the future of raw material pricing interest and exchange rates as well as the direction of market environments
5346093 competitor pricing pressures continue in all markets impacting margins it is too early to gauge the impact our price increases will have on revenue and sales
5346094 its just a matter of working through making sure one survives the storm if you like weathers the storm and comes through the other side
5346095 property and finance markets are still in a state of disarray i think its going to take quite some time for the market to settle down and also the players
5346096 weve quite clearly set that repayment out in all our releases i think were just quietly working through it really
5346097 well the markets a market but no were just quietly working through and i think on a high level well on track

5346109 we believe there is potential to bring benefits both to the bank and our customers through improved efficiencies and costs relating to processing and service times
5346110 the response we got was that having the two brands provides a competitive advantage in effect they have two banks
5346111 the concern comes at a point when they dont see that as a strategic advantage any more

5346131 um our entire universe is uh actually completely contained in uh speck of dust on a on a black sabbath poster in a teenagers bedroom
5346132 it appears that what we have been calling the big bang was actually a discharge of static electricity when the dust made contact with the poster in this youngsters room we all here at nasa have different interpretations about what this discovery means for the human race but we all do agree on one important thing we have got to develop a method to keep this young man from cleaning his room

5346160 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5346190 for any project we begin we need to know that our tools are going to help us work as fast as we can think and get the job done under budget usually with intense deadlines

5346207 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5346208 i look forward to reporting to my colleagues in the senate and on the foreign relations committee as well as the administration about what i learn
5346209 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want and john sometimes hes a good person but hes a little bit given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them and thats what you want in a president
5346210 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5346211 i said i was skeptical of it because i thought it was too late like senator mccain i wanted it to start earlier

5346217 there werent two friends who loved each other more than prunes and rupe they were like spaghetti and meatballs they were like macaroni and cheese they went together like salt and pepper
5346218 its obvious that the president has kicked off his election campaign and is trying to fight against his main rival at the election using all the means
5346219 but the president started his campaign too early and besides it will not help him anyway
5346220 we will hear many such statements but we will continue doing out work as we are doing it today for the sake of national interests of ukraine
5346221 russia s leaders are seriously considering supporting prime minister yulia tymoshenko in the presidential campaign once she fulfils the condition of adopting a passive position in the conflict with georgia

5346308 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5346309 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5346310 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5346311 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5346312 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5346313 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5346314 we are certainly anxious and its very much our goal to have the positions filled

5346335 are you working for it or are you resting in it
5346336 you almost have to become illegal to be legal its hard to go that way because then a different referee could bring out a yellow card for your players at the moment the players and the referee are not on the same page
5346337 its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know before hand you want him to tell you this is how i see it

5346373 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5346374 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5346375 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5346384 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
5346385 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
5346386 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
5346387 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
5346388 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
5346389 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
5346390 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
5346391 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5346392 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5346393 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5346394 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5346395 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5346396 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
5346397 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

5346400 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5346401 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5346402 the worlds most famous store faces a very expensive strike our members keep harrods running they ensure the lights stay on the building operates safely and shoppers can get about the store it is difficult to imagine how the shop could function properly without them
5346403 it is very worrying that those workers who were not given two extra days holidays are in a recognised union while the shop floor workers who got the extra leave do not have a recognised union
5346404 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge

5346412 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out like on sunday and prove him wrong and i think we myself and ashley young did that today
5346413 all we can do is play good football for our clubs it is out of our hands whether or not we are selected
5346414 mr capello comes to villa quite a lot though and i am not going to give up we have just got to keep doing the business for our club that is all we can do
5346415 its always a great emotion to be selected for the national side
5346416 this is the greatest honour for a footballer and it is a huge pleasure for me
5346417 lippi has chosen me for his first squad after his return to the azzurri bench and now it is my job to prove my worth

5346422 in the last few years the market for personal loans has been extremely competitive as lenders and borrowers alike cashed in on the availability of cheap credit increased competition pushed prices down and lenders continually undercut each other in order to top best buy tables

5346424 no hi ha barrera pany ni forrellat que puguis imposar a la llibertat de la meva ment
5346425 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
5346426 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time

5346465 i think the reason i was successful was because i had pretty good command of my fastball
5346466 in the later innings i was throwing breaking balls for strikes and i think i could have done a little better job of throwing more off speed pitches earlier on in the count the big thing that helped me today was the command of my fastball to overpower hitters with it and using the off speed when i had to
5346467 all the games here seem to look like theyre going to be one run games with my ballclub it seems like we are trying to get something going offensively we still have two or three guys here that are struggling every game is a big game tomorrow is going to be a huge game with chinese taipei we came here to get in the medal round so tomorrows game is definitely huge
5346468 and raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in christ jesus
5346469 if then you were raised with christ seek those things which are above where christ is sitting at the right hand of god set your mind on things above not on things on the earth for you died and your life is hidden with christ in god

5346471 these are often young talented people the cream of south africas future and they are finding all their dreams put on hold because they went through a mad year or a few months of acquiring credit cards store accounts a too expensive car and a home exceeding their means
5346472 during that time they spent money like crazy buying what they couldnt afford because low interest rates gave a false sense of wealth and then interest rates began going up now they are in serious trouble
5346473 take the real case of megan and bruce they bought a modest townhouse two years ago in cape town stopped their credit card and wisely froze their monthly bond repayment of r5 000pm but now more than 10 interest rate hikes later and at the end of the fixed term their bank has informed them that as from september their bond repayments will rise to r9 000pm
5346474 it gives consumers breathing space to pay off outstanding debt but it would be very dangerous to assume that interest rates will not continue to rise

5346502 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5346503 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5346504 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5346505 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5346506 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services

5346508 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5346509 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5346510 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5346511 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5346512 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5346513 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5346514 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5346515 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5346516 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5346754 we remain bullish on the industry fundamentals for the co location and dedicated server sector where capacity constraints at a time of strong demand is giving the incumbents strong pricing leverage and volume growth
5346755 that would provide capacity for future growth of the companys canadian co location and dedicated server segments which are growing at 27 6 per cent and 17 9 per cent year over year respectively as of fiscal q3 08 ended march 31
5346756 beyond the valuation merits acquiring peer 1 would bring additional exposure to the growth data segment while it would provide a strong platform points of presence traffic peering client list for entering the u s market
5346757 with a shortage of canadian data centre capacity we expect that q9 could eventually fill this unused capacity whether the company attracts new customers through its sales force directly or through its wholesale partner ibm
5346758 since power costs represent approximately 50 per cent of the recurring expenses of operating a data centre and because iweb has access to the third cheapest source of power in north america due to its location we believe it could gain a competitive advantage over other web hosting service vendors

5346799 i gilberto gil brazilian citizen world citizen and minister of culture of brazil develop my work in music in the ministry and in all the dimensions of my existence under the inspiration of hacker ethics i am concerned about the issues that my world and my time pose to me such as the issue of the digital divide of free software and also the issue of regulation and development of audiovisual content production and distribution by any media for any purpose
5346800 deal with the audiovisual as an integrated and convergent economy following the evolution of new technological platforms
5346801 in the audiovisual sector the economic environment is being rearranged and the ownership concentration is growing big telecom companies are acquiring smaller companies from the movies media journalism and entertainment sectors generating mega corporations eager to conquer new markets these companies are able to maintain powerful relations with their own rich governments while also promoting interest based relations with its poor country hosts they implement political strategies to take down what they call barriers and fight against ownership concentration regulations in their home countries it is important to mention that these strategies are performed by highly competent and proactive state bureaucracies making use of all kinds of resources
5346802 the motion picture association of america mpaa threatened brazil with commercial retaliation if the government continued its plans to create ancinav
5346803 we need to relocate what is now centralised in the hands of few the majors of the cultural industry havent left anything for the peripheries thats why today the role of the brazilian state in formulating public policies is to empower the micro manifestations so that they become able to occupy the public spaces while being protagonists of the promotion and protection of diversity
5346804 to act upon digital culture is the concretisation of this philosophy which open spaces to redefine the form and the content of cultural policies and transforms the ministry of culture

5346817 although religion plays an important role in the lives of many teenagers religiosity tends to drop off as teens enter adulthood and then gradually increase again as young adults mature
5346818 did you attend church or synagogue in the past seven days or not
5346819 the most potent data regarding disengagement is that a majority of twentysomethings 61 percent of todays young adults had been churched at one point during their teen years but they are now spiritually disengaged
5346820 religion becomes more important again as young adults progress through their 20s possibly marry have children and settle down many americans want religion to play a role in their childrens lives and this desire may draw people back into their religious communities
5346821 teenagers will welcome a relationship with christ after someone welcomes them into a community of loving christians
5346822 twentysomethings were nearly 70 percent more likely than older adults to strongly assert that if they cannot find a local church that will help them become more like christ then they will find people and groups that will and connect with them instead of a local church
5346823 wed like you to be here for three years and then itll probably be time to go
5346824 the 50 50 calls go the way of the team thats creating the momentum
5346825 the tackles we were making were putting them behind the advantage line so we were going forward when you get a situation like that the calls tend to favour the guys going forward thats where we perhaps got a couple of calls
5346826 hes been playing really well at the olympics so thats a positive thing for us
5346827 theres no real surprises in the squad theres a couple of young guys who weve targeted for development going forward sam miskimmin and sunil hira
5346828 im excited about those junior black sticks guys stephen jenness and blair hilton and also guys like joel baker grant down and tim gyles who have been there or thereabouts
5346829 i think its a good mix of exciting youth and experience
5346830 its a shame but he just became a father a couple of weeks ago
5346831 hes been one of the standouts of the club competition theres no doubt hes still got it
5346832 ive been umming and ahhing yesterday it was no but this morning it was yes
5346833 but im thinking that you know im alive and just need a bit of a challenge ive missed coaching ive missed making a difference i want to put in to see what could be
5346834 given so many opportunities to be the best coach i can be
5346835 i think i should be imparting my knowledge and skills
5346836 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge
5346837 theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5346838 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5346839 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5346840 my first test was at ellis park in johannesburg in 2006 it was a huge shock it was a bit of a wake up call for me
5346841 i was playing club rugby about three weeks beforehand and then i was in front of 70 000 screaming south africans at altitude
5346842 for a front rower your scrummaging is your number one focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5346843 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5346844 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5346845 one of the unsung heroes out there is adam whitelock
5346846 for a young man like him still a colt to step into casey laulalas shoes and do what hes doing he makes the busts defends like a trojan and he does it without fuss
5346847 im enjoying it and learning off the senior guys and picking up a lot of useful stuff each week
5346848 tim sort of gets into half gaps which makes it quite easy to run off him hes pretty evasive and pretty skilful in terms of getting offloads and putting people into holes
5346849 hes pretty uncomplicated and hes a real student of the game so he works really really hard on and off the field and hes done the simple things well
5346850 senator stivers fully understands the many challenges and dangers our officers face
5346851 he is committed to ensuring that the law protects citizens that criminals are kept off our streets and that law enforcement has the tools and resources we need to protect the public steve will be an integral and accessible partner for central ohio police officers in washington
5346852 theres no one who wanted to see a change more than me i stepped up to make a difference to get things on track and i think weve been very successful so far
5346853 for example arbitrary regulation of rights their systems educational and propaganda and its executive but for the profound relationship of social forces
5346854 dan carter and i were just talking about that on the way in here that its just so refreshing to be able to play at that time with a dry ball
5346855 you know with a night game even if it doesnt rain by the time the night sets in you get a bit of dew and you might as well be a playing in the rain
5346856 for the outside backs its particularly a bit more enjoyable everyone gets a bit more tired because theres a lot more running and holes open up its something i always look forward to coming over here with the super 14 and for test matches
5346857 i get up on a saturday morning cook a couple of eggs pour a coffee and sit down and watch live rugby from new zealand

5346919 your work has changed me it s such an interesting effect your work has amazing art it also informs so specifically precisely
5346920 zoriah s pictures keep me breathless they are shocking and at the same time they have an attraction which makes me come back to look at them again and again zoriah s work has my full respect chapeau
5346921 your amazing photos take me away from my comfort zone and i confess i need that thank you for being out there and show all of us what is going on beyond our comfortable lives please be safe as much as possible
5346922 zoriah your pictures bring out so many emotions in me im at a loss for words they are heart wrenching and thought provoking thank you for sharing
5346923 theres a deep meaning in every photo youve been at the right time and place some photos made me cry and at the same time i was happy to see such a photostream its one of a kind thank you so much for sharing
5346924 zoriah is a real photographer thank you zoriah for showing us the truth
5346925 your work is beyond words almost to point of emotional breakpoint
5346926 a riveting unflinching set of some of the most poignant photography ive ever come across
5346927 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo
5346928 you have some outstanding work i checked your site and i understand why you have won awards you really cover your subject matter with an expert eye very inspiring and eye opening i will check back often
5346929 muito muito muito com o seu trabalho meus sinceros parabens fico feliz em ver fotografos engajados com a luta dos povos beijos e fortes abra os solid rios
5346930 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
5346931 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
5346932 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
5346933 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
5346934 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
5346935 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
5346936 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
5346937 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one
5346938 all i can say its very very impressive keep up the good work the world must know
5346939 oh my god his work is very dramatic reporting reality in a way never before seen i am impressed
5346940 your images are so profound they have so much depth and feeling attached to them i have much admiration for those who are willing to risk their own safety in order to capture images such as the ones you do
5346941 after watching your pics i m absolutely tired exhausted sooooo much information inside them one day i will make pictures like yours but it will take me three or four lives to learn to do it not great but incredible work thanks for showing us all the way master

5346977 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5346978 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities
5346979 that gives you an idea of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5346980 of costs for providing clean water around the world go toward corruption
5346981 whats the best way to get from here to there
5346982 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5346983 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5346984 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5346985 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5346986 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5346987 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5346988 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge

5346998 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5346999 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5347000 its going to be like that for the next three too
5347001 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better going against greece and going against spain were easy to get up for we could have easily had one of those games where we came in and made excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5347002 its a real physical team and were looking forward to it were going to have to get a lot of rest and take care of our bodies because its going to be one of those physical games one thing were going to do is to try to get up and down and try to wear them down a lot

5347008 one of the most original irish balladeers has gone unfortunately
5347009 he left an indelible mark on the music industry in so much as he inspired so many people
5347010 he turned a lot of people on to irish ballads he re introduced us to our own songs
5347011 if you were at the north pole and you heard that voice you would say thats ronnie drew
5347012 a lot of countries realize that with the rising price of fossil fuels and energy and the climate emergency nuclear can be part of the solution
5347013 this way nuclear energy can bring a lot its co2 free energy
5347014 instead of taking a position of attacking terror the government is freeing terrorists with blood on their hands in exchange for nothing
5347015 the inevitable result is that terror organizations will understand that they can send more terrorists to carry out more attacks in israel and theyll know that one day they too will be freed

5347017 people are buying right now buying at bargain prices the price mechanism is working
5347018 higher sales are great but foreclosures are still high and people need to appreciate that more discounts may be coming
5347019 no podemos caer ni en una euforia desmedida por lo conseguido el a o pasado ni en una decepci n fuera de lugar
5347020 lo que funcion el a o pasado fue que el equipo trabaj en bloque lo que propici que los jugadores brillaran en aquello en lo que m s pod an destacar
5347021 esta jugando bien trabajando en defensa y dirigiendo bien al equipo vi ndole la cara creo que est disfrutando de esta experiencia y en el equipo estamos esperando que venga para que nos explique las cosas curiosas del torneo
5347022 llegar m s arriba de lo que lo hicimos la pasada temporada ganando tres t tulos es muy dif cil
5347023 esta sanci n no es correcta porque no creo que haya cometido ning n crimen que se merezca esa cantidad

5347025 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5347026 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
5347027 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities

5347032 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing

5347035 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5347036 commence this attempt at coordination which it has to be said hasnt happened yet
5347037 im pleased to see that the department of the environment has been working on developing new planning guidelines to deal with flood prevention already and will have these ready for publication in september or october the reality of climate change is that ireland is going to suffer from more and more extreme weather events and this fact needs to be taken into account in development
5347038 the guidelines are being developed in conjunction with the office of public works they will require local authorities to include flood risk areas in their development plans this will put local authorities in a better position to deal with emergency situations like we have experienced over the last two weeks
5347039 some of the worst of the flooding in the dublin area over the last two weeks has occurred in places which have seen major building work over the past years including along the n3 beside the blanchardstown centre and along the finglas road towards the tolka valley the fact that huge patches of green space have been concreted over and many trees and hedges have been removed means that there is nothing left to soak up rain water and as such it lodges on roads
5347040 it sounds like all the residents and campers have been accounted for

5347045 and will continue to distract management to some level from focusing on the core business and remaining brands
5347046 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5347047 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5347048 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5347049 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5347050 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5347051 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5347052 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5347053 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5347054 we really want to get the message out to people

5347057 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5347058 all things considered the quality of the second earnings was good
5347059 while q3 will not be as strong and q2 was helped by seasonal and stimulus checks this is first time in recent memory that the company did not lower guidance and actually raised it which is major psychological change and keeps us bullish on the company and our other quality names
5347060 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers
5347061 im confident union banks present and future customers will be delighted with the results

5347068 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5347069 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5347070 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5347071 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5347072 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5347077 this decision shows the determination of the ioc to broaden the fight against doping to those behind athletes
5347078 may lead to serious consequences to the health of athletes even threatening their lives
5347079 we are well prepared for valencia of course we started our preparations for this new track by looking at the
5347080 we also sent staff to look at the inaugural race meeting there at the end of july and that gave us additional data with regards to speed profiles driving lines and track surface
5347081 in terms of performance we clearly want to build on the competitiveness shown in hungary we are genuinely challenging to be the third quickest car based on the last few races valencia will also show how well teams can react to new conditions so it will be an interesting weekend and we have every reason to be feeling very positive

5347095 supported by fees of the students and voluntary gifts of people who believe in giving the kind of education this institution gives
5347096 under our system of religious freedom which would be violated by this eeoc bill religious organizations have seen fit to use their own resources to establish church schools at every level of education elementary secondary and institutions of higher education they did so because they wanted youth taught in a religious atmosphere and by christian instructors

5347105 i just had to get myself going running the floor and getting deep in the paint and going right into the shot and being a big presence for the team
5347106 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well
5347107 when they have these three things great defense share the ball and shoot the ball well they are unbeatable
5347108 were in a tournament and now we get to play the best team in the world and have a swing at the big dog im confident we are going to go out there and play ball

5347132 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5347133 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5347134 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5347135 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5347136 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5347137 despite the quid pro quo nature of the deal we believe google will benefit disproportionately from this deal over time given the enticing opportunity to take a peek under the hood at yahoo
5347138 importantly the broader deal with a search and non search components could have a higher probability of clearing regulatory hurdles in our opinion instead of denying a stand alone search deal on the basis of googles dominant search market share the regulators will be forced to evaluate this broader advertising deal where no single company enjoys a significant market lead
5347139 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded

5347145 despite rumors to the contrary 30 seconds to mars is not calling it quits we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record
5347146 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5347147 we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than 7 years it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5347148 yes we have been sued by emi but not for failing to deliver music or for quitting we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5347149 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here wed rather not air any dirty laundry but basically our representatives could not get emi to agree to make a fair and reasonable deal
5347150 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier
5347151 that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so
5347152 the new mayor promised to listen to and fight for the residents of the outer london boroughs he must allow local people to have their say before his technocrats rail road through their one size fits all solution

5347163 theres always going to be nay sayers people that are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
5347164 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats gonna mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships
5347165 thats kind of why i do the things preaching in prisons doing those different things trying to take advantage of that platform that god has blessed me with
5347166 the things he does he would be doing them even if he wasnt a heisman winner
5347167 tim has done a lot of things that opened my eyes and thats one of them

5347169 in your own little way you made an impact on some people
5347170 those are just the pros and cons that come with what you do and how you do it ive been blessed to have some success at the college level so i have more obligations and more things i have to do sometimes you dont want to do that you just want to be a college student relax or something
5347171 but when i really sit down and think about it i want to do those things because those things are more important than playing football for me going and speaking in a prison is more important for me going to speak to a youth organization is more important to me than winning or playing a game
5347172 a study of mogul land taxes for 1647 finds that 445 families received 61 5 percent of all revenues which were about 50 percent of gross agricultural output and that roughly one quarter of the revenue flow to those families represented actual personal income the rest was consumed in various expenses of office if this is accurate these 445 families presumably less than 002 percent of the population would have received an income from their offices alone equal to 7 5 percent of total agricultural output or perhaps 6 percent of the societys total income an estimate based on shireen moosvis reconstructions for 1595 is similar it suggests that 1 671 mughal nobles would have had a net personal income from their claims on government revenue alone equal to about 7 percent of total empire wide output although the records moosvi worked from have been questioned her calculations could be off by quite a bit and still confirm our general picture and while at least some european visitors to china commented on a lack of severe poverty there europeans in india seem to have been struck by its extremes of wealth and poverty

5347185 i see then he will give the poor and homely man only to a woman he doesnt love
5347186 or think about this one does he love the poor homely man if so will he give him an ugly woman or might he give him a beautiful one
5347187 you said you wanted gods choices jane and gods choices involve his plans for a whole universe all the atoms all the worlds all the people pretty and ugly rich and poor hes engineering an intricate pattern for good and part of that pattern might necessitate giving a beautiful girl to a homely man maybe the man with no looks and no money is praying god will give you to him what about that now
5347188 thats too complicated for me ive prayed for his will and ive prayed for a rich handsome husband and thats what im going to get because jesus loves me and jesus wants me to be happy
5347189 so if you dont get him will that prove god doesnt love you
5347190 miserable and long faced then is that what god wants is that what holiness has to mean
5347191 has to no not only doesnt have to but cant real holiness cant possibly be miserable and long faced jane holiness means wholeness comes from the same root as hale you know hale and hearty healthy fulfilled
5347192 thats what it means for sure the problem starts when we make up our own minds what will give us happiness and then decide if we dont get exactly that that god doesnt love us we slither into a slough of god hats me self putty
5347193 but you just said he wants us to be happy he must want to give us what we want doesnt he i mean within reason
5347194 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
5347195 be joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
5347196 therefore as gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another forgive as the lord forgave you and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity
5347197 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under bowl instead they put it on its stand and it gives lght to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven
5347198 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from you father in heaven so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men it tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving maybe be in secret then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you

5347229 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5347230 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5347231 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5347232 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5347233 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5347234 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale

5347382 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5347383 saya nak jumpa supaya umno tidak terus menerima islam separuh sahaja kerana jika umno tidak ada islam menjadi lebih baik di bawah pas
5347384 kerana muzakarah bukan hendak membincangkan mengenai kerusi atau kementerian tetapi bagaimana hendak berdepan allah di hari akhirat kelak
5347385 umno tak boleh pegang tak menang anwar bukan calang calang orang

5347392 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
5347393 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
5347394 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
5347395 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
5347396 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
5347397 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
5347398 im blown away every time i walk past that apple store and theres always people queued up outside to get in
5347399 its popular its worth my money lets remake the game we add some stuff into it maybe bring it to another platform people will buy it more money will flow in

5347406 dari cerita cerita tersebar dan ada yang guan eng sendiri sebutkan bahawa dalam suatu majlis beliau berdepan dengan puak puak pembangkang umno dalam kerajaan pulau pinang beliau diasak dengan tekanan soalan menyerang beliau akhirnya beliau menasihati mereka bertakwalah kepada allah puak puak umno itu naik berang dan memberi amaran kata kata tersebut boleh dianggap menuduh mereka jadi kafir betul ke guan eng jadi panik beliau minta laluan keluar nak ke bilik air beliau terus telefon tok guru nik aziz mengesahkan apakah kata kata itu benar benar menuduh mereka jadi kafir tidak kata tok guru baru guan eng lega dan meneruskan majlisnya

5347410 sebenarnya tidak patut wujud perkataan golongan ulama dan profesional orang yang sama juga kerana tidak boleh dipisahkan
5347411 kalau ragu ragu dengan negara islam tengok kelantan itu contoh negara islam pelaburan banyak kita minta pr tiru kelantan kalau ada yang tidak betul beritahu dan kita akan baiki
5347412 kita tidak mahu berjumpa untuk berbincang hal masalah kementerian muzakarah boleh tetapi umno keluar daripada kesesatan dan terima al quran 100 peratus
5347413 muzakarah ini ingat mengingat masa depan di akhirat bukan bincang kementerian
5347414 secara melulu demi memenuhi agenda kelompok mereka yang jelas tidak meraikan semangat permuafakatan
5347415 hanya akan mengundang bahaya terhadap kestabilan dan keharmonian masyarakat yang telah terbina selama ini

5347418 itu amalan orang kristian sumpah dalam islam memang ada tetapi bukannya dengan memegang al quran
5347419 macamlah tidak ada benda lagi yang ditinggalkan oleh nabi muhammad untuk dicontohi dan tidak ada lagi benda lain dalam al quran yang hendak dirujuk kenapa hendak tiru gaya orang eropah

5347426 in light of differing activity for the developed and emerging market economies there have been mixed spot prices for key commodities
5347427 bulk and energy related commodities have tended to outperform the lme traded metals the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies

5347430 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5347431 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities
5347432 that gives you an idea of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5347433 of costs for providing clean water around the world go toward corruption

5347460 i thought id been quite hard done by it was a fail but when i sent it back it got marked up to a normal scholarship pass
5347461 i was really stoked when it came back with a positive result but also a little annoyed that it hadnt been marked properly the first time
5347462 no marking system is perfect never has been the fact that we have a back up system where things can be looked at again is very positive
5347463 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers
5347464 im confident union banks present and future customers will be delighted with the results
5347465 i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5347466 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
5347467 i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what im up against
5347468 shes not interested in talking about it now its a police matter weve got nothing to say anyway

5347470 the immense task of avalanche control whilst everyone else will be digging
5347471 ironically as soon as you start talking about those off the wall schemes its normally when the market starts to correct itself its a bit of a case of murphys law
5347472 you need to be careful in terms of urging policy makers to respond
5347473 its not flash if youre an existing property owner but the end game here is that house prices are going to become more affordable
5347474 you could argue instead of being more affordable its slightly less unaffordable
5347475 there is plenty of room for local and central government to change the way they do things to make it easier for people to buy and live in houses

5347495 hello have you forgotten who is in control of it all
5347496 hes an icon here in china he has a very bright future
5347497 if anybody takes a hit from it its certainly nike simply because theyre all about performance whereas the others are about brand image
5347498 nikes all about you dont win silver you lose gold with that attitude its much tougher for them because he was certainly the cornerstone for their program
5347499 whenever he goes out he sees his own picture in the streets
5347500 we will continue to count on liu xiang as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5347501 the demand for the program came from australian farmers unable to find the labor to get their produce to market for australia families
5347502 countries from the pacific have been very enthusiastic about wanting to fill that need and be part of the pilot
5347503 in addition to the benefits for australia farmers and consumers pacific islanders will benefit from the income experience and training received through the pilot scheme
5347504 the remittances sent home will significantly help the development of their villages and communities
5347505 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment its really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5347506 god says opens with a great meaty pounding guitar riff before a measured pause for some jesus amp mary chain lite vocals
5347507 right now there is food in haiti its just the price is out of reach if it makes sense economically for them to sell mangoes and import rice then thats what they should do
5347508 every game from here out will be like a game seven in the nba playoffs
5347509 when i think about the olympic games its hard to say something about the future
5347510 there are always surprises but if that happens that way i think it would be a great final i think it would be a lot of fun for people who love beach volleyball for those two teams to get into the final
5347511 he really played well he played better than hes ever played against us
5347512 its because of my will to participate in the olympics that have enabled me to overcome all sorts of difficulties
5347513 in brazil i tried to have my ankle cured but i didnt have it totally cured but i got a lot of encouragement and due to my will to overcome those difficulties i could compete in the olympics

5347519 to find out he has received a harsher punishment than clements who didnt have a licence and didnt have insurance im speechless
5347520 clements got less than someone with an under inflated tyre wheres the justice in that thats insane
5347521 the guy brooks was travelling along doing something we all do any day of the week and he came upon this terrible situation no doubt it has changed his life my heart goes out to him
5347522 he was in the wrong place at the wrong time i feel no antagonism to him
5347523 i know what happened to sarah was an accident but it was an accident that could have been avoided clements put her in that situation
5347524 you always believe the courts are there to support you and help you and to do the right thing this is laughable it is a joke
5347525 it most probably is the second impact with the volkswagen that caused her death
5347526 perhaps i should have done more to get them to understand that and it was an oversight on my behalf suffolk homes
5347527 battle with cancer was the most important story of his life
5347528 though we have a bit of work to do on that there are some guidelines out of australia to help us but they can only be guidelines because it really does come down to common sense
5347529 it doesnt mean you are going to stop this sort of thing from happening but it heightens awareness it will say to agents be aware of who you are taking to a property and ask questions so you are not going in blind partner up if you have to but do what you need to to protect yourself
5347530 who told you not to do it bea shes just jealous of you
5347531 this is the first time we have an ability to have democracy in the way we define it in burma theres no opportunity for democratic interactions outside of the web particularly because there are so many people outside of the boarders this effort allows people who are outside the country to build what their future country will look like
5347532 the name waikoko springs is the only remnant of traditional practices that once existed
5347533 the significance of the updated wahi tapu therefore relates to the presence of the original source of the water rather than the extraordinary formation of a manmade lake
5347534 weve told them we are not interested in being part of any process
5347535 we have made no formal approach to the council and as far as im concerned they have no claim on anything around here
5347536 im considering taking a prime and lovely and exclusive trip down a road paved with gold diamonds and rubies that will land me in greece for six months havent you always wanted to go to greece lover boy yes i thought so by the way the wine you two are drinking it came from somewhere you cant afford to go and it cost something you cant afford to pay tra la la
5347537 well of course shes lonely who the hell could stand her
5347538 oh elsa thats silly we work together and she likes you fine i know she doesnt talk to you that much but its because she doesnt know you cruella is a nice person she knows a lot of people she has a lot of contacts you should be nice she could do you a lot of good
5347539 the sycophant part three invited left invited right sideways and upside down
5347540 you should be nice she could do you a lot of good
5347541 the senator is encouraging all young people like yourselves to go home and become involved with your community
5347542 but weve been with the campaign since the very beginning we traveled all the way from madison wisconsin and missed a semester of college and we bartered and ate peanut butter sandwiches and spent our own money to travel with the campaign and now youre telling us to go home
5347543 they cant fire you from your own campaign what kind of nonsense is that
5347544 earlier on we had an issue as to whether wed get through winter but its now more of an issue of getting through spring
5347545 you are hanging by on the grace of the single circuit dc link i accept it is unlikely but things happen snowfall could knock a transmission tower down
5347546 were not there there are lots of steps that can be taken before we do that
5347547 the generators are concerned about the south island storage of course it is late in the year but what we can do about that of course is make sure we are getting as much dc flow on the cook strait cable because we are awash with water in the north island
5347548 it means our dependence on thermal power will carry on right through to the summer
5347549 it further highlights just how dependent we are on thermal generation when things get tight
5347550 but on the positive side of the ledger there is an awful lot of snow when temperatures warm that will be a very useful addition to the storage position
5347551 spring is when we start to get our main inflows through snow and rain its just a question of when it happens
5347552 do i look like a slave to white middle class new zealand what business is it to you
5347553 hurry up and stand me down i dont want nothing to do with this pakeha system
5347554 i guess it would be presumptuous to kiss you on the lips wouldnt it
5347555 ssshhhh we got our boy information will come our way until victory always set fire when done
5347556 while delegates nominate the democratic candidate perhaps we should all join them in celebrating our democracy in action
5347557 its because of your father amy your father is such a strong personality that youre looking for him in every other man you meet
5347558 but those 18 year olds who cant vote they didnt give him the right the government doesnt own us it doesnt own our bodies they have no right to order people into battle and when they do it we certainly have the right to protest
5347559 amy you know i agree with you i don t know why you are fighting this way
5347560 im angry because you didnt bother giving me a warning about all this i had to find out through the chicago police
5347561 bueno resulta que mi hermano mayor esta casado y este verano empeze a ayudarlo en el trabajo trabaja con su esposa y la cuestion que ella tiene 28 a os me elogia demasiado tanto que casi parece un intento de seducirme me toca y me abraza frotandose demasiado contra mi dice que soy demasiado lindo y cosas asi y la verdad es que me hace sentir algo incomodo y placer a la vez porque ciertamente me esta empezando a producir algo de deseo y aunque se que es la novia de mi hermano no lo puedo evitar que deberia hacer pd yo tengo 17
5347562 the mac minis input is a line level input whereas the mic line on most analog headsets needs a mic level input to power the mic the mini isnt giving the mic any power so its not going to work
5347563 mad as hell and theyre not going to take it anymore
5347564 the wicked borrow and do not repay but the righteous give generously
5347565 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
5347566 are you nervous about being part of a public lawsuit with your dad and everything
5347567 i shouldnt be telling you this i love this and i would do anything when i have this on me

5347569 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5347570 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5347571 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5347572 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5347573 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5347574 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5347575 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5347576 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5347577 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5347578 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5347579 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5347580 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5347581 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5347582 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5347583 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5347584 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5347585 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5347586 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5347587 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5347588 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5347589 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5347590 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5347591 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5347592 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5347593 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5347594 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5347595 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5347596 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5347597 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5347598 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5347599 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5347600 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5347601 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5347602 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5347603 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5347604 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5347605 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5347606 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5347607 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5347608 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5347609 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5347610 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5347611 why was this event with a christian minister only one of four times the candidates have agreed to appear together before the election
5347612 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5347613 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
5347614 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5347615 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5347616 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5347617 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5347618 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5347619 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5347620 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5347621 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5347622 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5347623 keeping our talent very high quality and very engaged in what we do
5347624 job two is i need to move to an online model as fast as i possibly can
5347625 if you look at our customers behavior patterns youre seeing them engaging with fully connected experiences
5347626 and i think we have ips and ideas and expertise that can really allow us to do that i think warhammer these can be very lucrative for us and they can be very exciting from a developer standpoint because youre moving from a fire and forget model to more of a service model where you launch the game but youre thinking 24 7 about whens my first content pack whats happening with telemetry how are people playing the game and how do i make their experiences better
5347627 i dont know how itll manifest itself in terms of an overall platform service but im just not interested in single player only experiences anymore when were green lighting new ideas we look at the team we look at the ip and an important part of this is also looking at what is the online experience like and how do we measure and capture an idea thats bigger than just a fire and forget model
5347628 for a while there we lost faith with our customers because we were churning out games that might have made sense from a financial standpoint but frankly we had walked away from the art of making games and offering breakthrough creative experiences
5347629 there werent as many games in our lineup that i wanted to play anymore so part of what we embarked on here is to make more things that our people care about making and making more things that we own that also puts you into a place where when you go online you have a lot more flexibility and a lot more freedom to do things with that ip that in some cases licenses preclude you from doing
5347630 i wish i could support john mccain as a fellow returned pow i have found i am expected to support him but i cannot
5347631 now hold it right there floyd james thompson major us army special forces was captured before all of us
5347632 the story takes wallace and gromit in a direction we havent seen before both emotionally and technically
5347633 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5347634 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5347635 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5347636 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5347637 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5347638 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5347639 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5347640 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5347641 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5347642 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5347643 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5347644 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5347645 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5347646 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5347647 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5347648 theyre told they can get a one way ticket either to some other part of canada or some other part of the province
5347649 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5347650 this is a planning took where all things are going
5347651 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5347652 i use my voice in order to fit in better with hearing people
5347653 okay i wont use my voice in a deaf context because it hurts members of the community
5347654 this spatial point which represents bob bob was in the process of walking
5347655 i like how it feels when the wind blows a t night
5347656 culture is to society what memory is to the person
5347657 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5347658 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5347659 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5347660 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5347661 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5347662 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5347663 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5347664 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5347665 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5347666 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5347667 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5347668 este deporte es casi todo mental y yo no ten a nimo para corre quer a estar con mi familia
5347669 fue dif cil tomar la decisi n no iba a corre pero al finalo lo hice por ella
5347670 no vi el r cord hasta dar la vuelta de honor
5347671 con pasar a la final me dar a con un canto en los dientes
5347672 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5347673 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5347674 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5347675 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5347676 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5347677 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5347678 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5347679 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5347680 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5347681 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5347682 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5347683 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5347684 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5347685 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5347686 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5347687 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5347688 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5347689 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5347690 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
5347691 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5347692 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5347693 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5347694 going against greece and going against spain it was really easy to get up for
5347695 and we could have easily came in and had one of those games where we make excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5347696 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan
5347697 to demonstrate that the release of prisoners can be achieved through talks and not through violence and the kidnapping of soldiers
5347698 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5347699 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5347700 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5347701 tackle what members of both parties see as his greatest vulnerability with undecided voters his otherness
5347702 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5347703 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5347704 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5347705 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5347706 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5347707 verbosity and love of his own voice that drive many including by some accounts mr obama nuts
5347708 the party is putting more money into what strategists call early voter persuasion getting a jump on previous years in their push to identify democratic voters and nail down their allegiance by providing background information and other material it is distinct from voter turnout drives that will begin closer to the election
5347709 behind the scenes drama surrounding senator hillary rodham clinton continues to fan out
5347710 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election
5347711 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5347712 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism

5347731 oh there are a lot of deaf people in san francisco
5347732 i believe the greater deafhood movement allows individualist deaf persons to reconnect with the deaf community
5347733 it got worse after pl 94 142 i understand that today more than 75 i dont have the exact numbers here of deaf school age children are in programs where they are the only deaf child with one other deaf child or two others
5347734 this movement could possibly generate new action and new discourse instead of just dialogue
5347735 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5347736 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5347737 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5347738 people came together and helped each other out there were times there when we thought people were gonna die we were definitely nervous for ourselves
5347739 in an environment which fosters oralism which research will most likely be met with funding and general approval research on bilingual education and the positive benefits of cultural dissemination or research on phonetic cueing systems and applications for speech acquisition
5347740 critical theory shows us how language can be used to oppress but also how language can be used to emancipate applications of critical theory and discourse theory will provide new vocabulary and narratives for the deaf and hopefully change how society perceives its audistic tendencies
5347741 i really just want to spend a day in the life with nastia you know see how she does it
5347742 yea sure you do you son of a b h

5347749 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5347750 before i could gather up my goods the torrent had washed away tomatoes worth about fcfa 2000 it was hell the water was knee deep
5347751 the rains turned the market into a swimming pool sending us scurrying after our goods
5347752 help you know i need somebody help not just anybody
5347753 writing i think is not apart from living writing is a kind of double living the writer experiences everything twice once in reality and once in that mirror which waits always before or behind
5347754 quedar de primera que se fijen en nosotros y que se queden con la boca abierta
5347755 la comodidad para el perro ante todo la calidad y un buen dise o que es muy muy diferente al resto de la moda canina

5347757 it must be said once you begin playing as steve tyler and the gang the title feels much fresher than before
5347758 unfortunately there are areas of this game that pinpoint the lack of any improvement to the series
5347759 this cristallised as an idea to an extent yesterday sunday
5347760 this week it will be developed at working level and then discussed with the french presidency at the appropriate level

5347762 one of the steps that the european union urged belarus to take for the facilitation of a mutual dialogue
5347763 other political prisoners will also be freed in the nearest future
5347764 it would give a serious impetus for belarus to normalise relations with the euro atlantic community
5347765 it is being widely reported that the mid air collision at coventry on 17th august involved a microlight aircraft
5347766 using the caa civil aviation authority uk register i have confirmed that the aircraft was not a microlight it was a two seat home built light aircraft from the laa light aircraft association fleet
5347767 irrespective of aircraft type i would like to offer the condolences of all the bmaa membership to the families and friends of the pilots and passengers of the two aircraft

5347776 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5347777 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5347778 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5347779 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5347780 friendship is like a prism through which many variations of beauty are revealed in our lives
5347781 first of all i am glad to be back racing with the
5347782 the bottom line is the evidence doesnt support a simple assault charge
5347783 there were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up
5347784 my sisters and brothers wont even talk to me anymore
5347785 we have no comment on specifics but we want to be clear noble supports open and transparent development of wind projects in accordance with the highest ethical standards
5347786 i feel as a mother as a grandmother that the country needs it not just here
5347787 we see this industry coming we see the payments coming in

5347790 about double what we are spending today on child incentives

5347793 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5347794 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities

5347796 i was cooling out and surfing in costa rica and the bahamas
5347797 and ran into people from all kinds of places i noticed everybody was listening to classic soul music when i came back home the music for this album flowed organically naturally since i have my own studio i was able to perfect it take my time to make it right i was able to live with it day after day and that had a lot to do with how the album turned out
5347798 the track reminds me of early 70s soul songs and getting joss to sing on it wasnt hard because she has a profound appreciation for great classic music
5347799 i am convinced from actual experiments that coca is the very best substitute for opium with a person addicted to the opium habit that has ever discovered it supplies the place of that drug and the patient who will use it as a means of cure may deliver himself from the pernicious habit without inconvenience or pain
5347800 i wish it were in my power to substitute the coca and compel all who are addicted to the use of opium morphine alcohol tobacco or other narcotic stimulants to live on the coca plant or any of its true preparations
5347801 were pretty excited about finishing pool play undefeated and getting onto the medal round
5347802 i just had to get myself going running the floor and getting deep in the paint and going right into the shot and being a big presence for the team
5347803 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well
5347804 when they have these three things great defense share the ball and shoot the ball well they are unbeatable
5347805 were in a tournament and now we get to play the best team in the world and have a swing at the big dog im confident we are going to go out there and play ball
5347806 hes been not only part of the national team program but hes been a part of mls from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
5347807 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong

5347812 i can just imagine if we stayed together what we would be doing
5347813 its not surprising because were investing very much in water polo
5347814 were investing in the kids we have some of the best training programs we have the best competition
5347815 it really shows how much talent we have in our country
5347816 i am the coach and i dont how to solve the problem they look very tired this is the most problem
5347817 now some players are playing so many minutes in the game
5347818 we cant change the players as often as we usually do and now they look tired
5347819 it is a really big deal for us because we separated from serbia two years ago and weve made a very good team
5347820 weve won european championships and had a lot of success and now were one of the top six olympic teams it says a lot for our team and our country
5347821 hes been not only part of the national team programme but hes been a part of mls from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
5347822 wed be honoured and privileged if bruce was part of the organisation but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong

5348019 we disagree that it is appropriate to reject sexual orientation as a suspect classification in applying the california constitutions equal protection clause on the ground that there is a question as to whether this characteristic is or is not immutable california cases establish that a persons religion is a suspect classification for equal protection purposes and ones religion of course is not immutable but is a matter over which an individual has control
5348020 if the reverend truly believes that immutability and unchangeability are prerequisites for a characteristic to be a legitimate subject for civil rights protections how does he reconcile this notion with the fact that ones religious beliefs and worship practices neither of which are immutable or unchangeable but are chosen behaviors are specifically protected by the bill of rights and countless other civil rights laws

5348036 there are incredible opportunities right now in our public schools
5348037 the problem is many people including teachers dont know they are there and if they do they are afraid to act
5348038 there are christians involved at every level in the public schools
5348039 our strategy is to equip them so they do what their state academic standards expect and the courts already allow
5348040 it was strictly about knowledge and laws and it empowers the teachers with the knowledge needed to be most effective in the classroom
5348041 it is stunning to realize that the majority of christian families send their children to public schools but churches dont have the resources to equip them to be christian influences in their kids schools
5348042 what i found most encouraging was that i could see and hear how the participants were moving from fear to freedom
5348043 her attorney has not received any information on this matter
5348044 we just found out that she owns it from these 10 press calls today
5348045 the fact that she has let this home go into disrepair is another example of her long history of mismanagement of public and personal resources
5348046 if she cant handle the management of a house how can she make decisions for the benefit of the people

5348050 some open source companies have not truly figured that out
5348051 this is why you buy from me rather than my competitor and rather than taking it from me for free
5348052 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5348053 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5348054 there is a lot one learns from music when you play music you have to express yourself but simultaneously you have to listen to what the others are playing just think what a lesson that is for life how our life would be and how our politicians would be if they could think like this that is why every child should have a musical education

5348058 when we re evaluated our position we said ok we need to reboot the dell operating system so to speak with an upgrade mr dell said
5348059 there were things we needed to do around that so we launched several initiatives consumer enterprise notebooks small to medium business and perhaps one of the most important a new strategy for emerging countries we assigned leadership teams and made investments
5348060 we are doing things very very different and have increased our commitment to product innovation and thought leadership and we have enhanced that with some acquisitions you are seeing a new dell emerging here
5348061 if you look at our competitive advantage one thing that has not changed over this entire period is that dell learns a tremendous amount from the direct relationships with our customers and the conversations we have
5348062 now we have turbocharged that with the internet and blogs and wikis we have 2 billion conversations a year and that inspires us and we are using all that new information to verify our position and using that information to expand
5348063 i was the chief executive for the first 20 years i am still a relatively young guy so i will keep doing this for a while i am 43 years old
5348064 we make more revenue from our computer product than our nearest competitor so we are selling more valuable computers
5348065 during the past 10 years our company has grown its shipping volumes by about 10 times there is really no other company in the industry that has done that it is also true that there was period when our growth slowed down at the end of that
5348066 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
5348067 im more familiar with comments like this is the time to show what were made of or champions are built on overcoming adversity like this i was a little surprised by it im not criticizing hank but it seems like it would be more steinbrenner like if he were to challenge them
5348068 im not writing off this season theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
5348069 if we dont make it this year im not going to explode
5348070 were going to win it next year if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
5348071 it has to start today we have to do everything right to win we have to pitch we have to play defense we have to base run we have to hit with runners in scoring position and work the starter and try to knock them out early theres no magic potion to it we have to play good baseball
5348072 they have these little soda biscuits inside these little crackers and we were just sitting there eating crackers the whole time every time you would think you would run out they would bring more i dont know where they get them from but thats truly what we did we just ate crackers for four hours
5348073 everybodys crammed in there we just talked and let the hours go by i guess team bonding
5348074 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
5348075 during the second rain delay i was handed an appendix to the rules it was then that we learned if there was a delay of 90 minutes or more that the game can be called it wasnt signed i dont know if we could have gotten back in the game but with the bases loaded and no outs i cant say that we would not have put any runs on the board
5348076 listen im so tired of talking about this stuff it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult im 40 you dont get better when you are 40
5348077 its so pathetic you guys write about things happening in a weeks time thats why we dont like you baseball is a six month game
5348078 ive been here four years and i have never seen vin scully down here in the clubhouse how does vin scully know me how does vin scully know derek lowe
5348079 i think its helped him jeff is a good enough hitter in his own right and being a good hitter he has the patience to take advantage of a pitcher who doesnt want to walk the guy who bats ahead of manny
5348080 everyone says im hitting now because some guy says so on tv
5348081 im learning a lot from manny hes always talking about what the pitcher is doing hey hes one of the best right handed hitters in the game who better to listen to he talks about baseball all the time i try to learn from people that have been there and done that they know what it takes to succeed
5348082 the minute brian matusz signed with baltimore i called randy hendricks and said brian matusz the fourth player taken in the country the first pitcher taken in the country just signed with baltimore we are prepared to do a deal within that framework if you want to talk about a matusz deal he responded via e mail that he had no interest in the matusz deal and he had no interest in a deal below matusz
5348083 their final offer was not a major league contract they had previously offered a major league contract at a much lower total number they were the only team that let the difference of several hundred thousand dollars get in the way of signing their top pick
5348084 we went with the market when castro signed at 2 075 million we reacted and we moved when matusz signed we reacted and we moved when gordon beckham signed we reacted and we moved we did not stick with well thats the way it was coming in because last year all those guys got 1 8 to 2 1 million when beckham got 2 6 and matusz got 3 2 we went right with whatever the market was
5348085 i did call the father last night after our 3 5 million was rejected we sent an email to aaron and i made a phone call to the dad prior to 12 just to say i just want to make sure that youre aware that you all rejected 3 5 million and we hope you reconsider because we really want you a national we also had a conversation and it did get them upset but we wanted to make sure that when we did get the 9 million offer one of our scouts did contact the dad just to let him know youre really at 9 million here with a day to go
5348086 we just want to get the best players when it was our turn to pick it was clear that aaron crow was the player we wanted to take we have no regrets over taking him we only regret that we werent able to sign him we just wanted to sign him
5348087 we greatly appreciate the faith pedro and his family have placed in the pirates organization
5348088 it became clear that tanners financial expectations were not in line with the risks presented by tanners current status as a pitcher in the early stages of a rehabilitation program unfortunately tanners rehabilitation program timeline changed dramatically from what his representative presented to us prior to the draft had tanner been able to demonstrate that he was fully recovered we are confident that we could have found common ground
5348089 stay relaxed and dont panic theyll get something done and even if they dont youll still be playing baseball hey its an honor and a privilege to know him and to go to his home in the winter and hit in his batting cage
5348090 i guess id categorize it as somewhat troubling the market unfortunately forces you to be very aggressive if you want to be competitive but at the end of the day i feel great about the player
5348091 i was really impressed with the way things were run down there they have nice uniforms they fed the kids well theres good talent and theyve really got some nice things going on i realize the big leagues are down the road but theyve got skill and athleticism down there theyre working with these kids every day teaching bunt plays rundowns cutoffs and relays when they come to the united states theyll have an idea whats going on
5348092 theyre asking for the ranch they want you to take on their contracts and give you prospects its one or the other and they want both
5348093 maybe the 88 wins last year didnt make as much sense as we thought we won 88 games and then we added erik bedard and carlos silva and thought that would put us on our way but maybe we over achieved because of the run differential the 88 wins didnt make a lot of sense but we still had 88 wins we thought things would be better
5348094 it felt like my arm exploded and i thought my career was completely over
5348095 i think its great news that we got he blew up scar tissue it wasnt an elbow shoulder or anything like that from my standpoint thats great great news
5348096 it didnt affect me at all i think its pretty lame i give it all ive got pitching hurt people just dont know what we go through
5348097 this should be a dramatic illustration that we are serious about cementing the long term success of this franchise through amateur scouting and player development
5348098 in a few years melky will be playing in some independent league or in the mexican league
5348099 i think you always want to improve all your stats you want to get better each year in all categories if you do that youll have a long career thats always the focus for me i dont think im a power guy i just consider myself a good ballplayer who goes out each day and gives a hard effort
5348100 the decision to have a tony bobblehead tony pena jr promotion was made back in february and march when you think about the royals situation back then tony was coming off a very good year and was regarded around the league as one of the top defensive shortstops in baseball there was really no way of anticipating that he wouldnt be the regular starter now and when we plan these promotions and carry them out its not really performance based
5348101 with crawford and longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
5348102 i mean listen its hamiltons year and why not have him hit a grand slam right there and really screw up ours
5348103 when the guys al manager of the year like hes going to be things go your way
5348104 to have my number retired next to yours is not only fitting but truly an honor we stood next to each other for so many years we had a great ride now we stand side by side forever my friend
5348105 we need to be insured for snow plowing so that this reads for snow plowing
5348106 presenting an exciting mix of contemporary and new plays in historic downtown lowell
5348107 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5348108 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5348109 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5348110 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5348111 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5348112 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5348113 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5348114 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5348115 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5348116 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5348117 who are open to doing something on the production side
5348118 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5348119 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5348120 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5348121 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5348122 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5348123 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5348124 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5348125 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5348126 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5348127 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5348128 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5348129 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5348130 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5348131 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5348132 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5348133 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5348134 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5348135 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5348136 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5348137 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5348138 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5348139 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5348140 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5348141 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5348142 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5348143 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5348144 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5348145 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5348146 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5348147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5348148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5348149 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5348150 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5348151 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5348152 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5348153 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5348154 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5348155 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5348156 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5348157 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5348158 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5348159 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5348160 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5348161 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5348162 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5348163 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5348164 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5348165 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5348166 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5348167 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5348168 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5348169 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5348170 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5348171 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5348172 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5348173 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5348174 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5348175 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5348176 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5348177 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5348178 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
5348179 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
5348180 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
5348181 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
5348182 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
5348183 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu
5348184 whiskeys for drinking waters for fighting that are a lot less likely to be swinging in november

5348192 we begin to see demand destruction because the high oil prices begin to plummet so for the second half of the year we think the market is going to ease off a little bit
5348193 but somehow we got lucky for the last quarter we expected the tanker market to slow down but were again surprised that it came out strong and spilled over the following quarter
5348194 but in the third quarter we will see a downfall in terms of tanker rate
5348195 we are hopeful that through all the measures and initiatives taken we would be able to reduce operation costs by 20 per cent in the next two or three years
5348196 in terms of fleet we will not seek new capex capital expenditure for acquisition of new vessels we are not buying new ships as we already put on order for 32 new ships to be delivered up to 2010 so there is no new capex required
5348197 there has been a lot of speculation i want to say categorically we are not pursuing hummer
5348198 we are pursuing our own models strategy and we do not want to tarnish our lean warrior strategy
5348199 the acquisition may be necessary for stx to grow its portfolio to include more lucrative value added ships but new businesses like cruise ships dont have strong prospects at the moment
5348200 investors need to be cautious until aker yards see an improvement in its bottom line
5348201 in the second half we are very cautious about the outlook of capital markets
5348202 it will be challenging to achieve last years profit levels
5348203 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5348204 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5348205 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5348206 nodx will likely remain in the red for the balance of the year as the global slowdown broadens beyond the us to the rest of the world
5348207 despite the better performance in exports to some asian markets we doubt that this will be sustained
5348208 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5348209 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5348210 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5348211 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5348212 juliet mcbride of aldermaston womens peace camp awpc will appear before newbury magistrates court on 20 and 21 august charged with trespass on a nuclear licensed site under the serious organised crime and police act socpa
5348213 offence will therefore protect the general publics democratic right to protest by ensuring that any such protests are conducted in a safe and controlled environment
5348214 successive governments have shown they are determined to stifle democratic participation in decision making about britains nuclear weapons
5348215 there would have to be substantial entry beyond the fence
5348216 the individuals concerned would physically have to go beyond the fence
5348217 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5348218 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5348219 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5348220 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5348223 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5348524 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5348525 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5348526 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5348527 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud

5348530 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5348531 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5348532 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5348533 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5348534 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5348535 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5348536 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5348537 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5348538 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5348644 for the present this is enough concerning the creed to lay a foundation for simple people einen grund zu legen f r die einf ltigen so that one does not overburden them when they understand the essentials of it they may pursue it themselves relating what they learn in the scriptures to these teachings growing and increasing forever more into a richer understanding for concerning these things we have to learn and preach daily as long as we live

5348780 i feel like hes relaxed feel like hes training the way he needs to train
5348781 there are five or six in the world picked as could be winners and i think hes in that category because of his style
5348782 you have to get better between the trials and the games its not back up the thrusters and coast in i know that even when he left for china there was still gain to be gained he hadnt peaked yet thats a good thing

5348796 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5348797 in new jersey the rent is very high and the jobs pay minimum wage

5348802 reagan won the cold war almost without firing a shot
5348803 h e laid the groundwork for the gop to escape half a century of minority status and he decisively vindicated the claims of conservatism
5348804 reagan gave a push to the tottering statues of marx and lenin

5348815 there was a sense of excitement in the air as the new dealers devised one program after another that at least harked back to the progressive movement of the early twentieth century and at times beyond that to the populist and socialist platforms as well long standing calls by american reformers and radicals for greater government control over business operations for support of labor unionization for social welfare measures for public works projects for planning and for a discarding of laissez faire approaches appeared to be heeded to some degree or another by the roosevelt brain trusters while it was clear after a brief spell that the new deal was not ushering in a hoped for revolution of the left or a feared one spearheaded by the right it was also evident that the influence of progressive intellectual and activists on government policy was greater than ever this development was possible not simply because the economic collapse had thoroughly discredited conservative panaceas but also because many radicals had discarded their early insistence on the need for drastic change in the united states and fearing the growing threat of fascist aggression the soviet union that model socialist state began in the middle of the decade to urge an antifascist alliance of liberal and radical forces that development coupled with the apparent new deal successes at home made peaceful reform appear increasingly attractive
5348816 dealers and dreamers a new look at the new deal
5348817 washington was the center of action and most of us wanted to be part of the action the new dealers brought to washington new energies new ideas and the fruitful clash of ideas both new and old
5348818 the innovations of the new deal were fueled by the militant demands for change that swept the country as fdr began his presidency the tenants groups the unemployed councils the millions on strike on the west coast in the midwest and the south the disruptive actions of desperate people seeking food housing jobs the turmoil threatening the foundations of american capitalism we will need a similar mobilization of citizens today to unmoor from corporate control whoever becomes presidents

5348869 winston peters told parliaments privileges committee tonight he could not be in breach of the laws around disclosure of debts owed by mps or their payment because his lawyer never sent him any bills mr peters and his lawyer brian henry argued that without bills being rendered for legal work no debts existed and therefore could not be declared the committee was hearing a complaint laid by act leader rodney hide that mr peters was in contempt of parliament by not disclosing a 100 000 cheque from expatriate billionaire owen glenn mr peters had two defences against that the cheque was paid into mr henrys account to help meet his legal costs after the 2005 election and mr henry did not tell him about it until july this year mps have to declare donations debts and gifts in the annual register of pecuniary interests mr peters did not disclose a debt or the cheque and he told the committee he could not have done so because he did not know about the cheque and no debt existed the evidence given by the nz first leader and his lawyer revealed what appeared to be an extraordinarily loose arrangement between them

5348879 i think the chinese just have the luxury of being able to watch games without all the extra that we have to put up with espn fawning over certain athletes legal problems etc etc when we watch kobe play it s tainted by colorado and shaq and his supposed selfishness i bet if we could forget about all that superfluousness we d love him that much too

5348936 japan played very well they forced us to play the way we did and the good part about that is the way they knock it around and even though they scored first we stayed focused and we believed in what we were doing

5348961 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5348962 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5348963 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5348964 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5348965 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future

5348975 it sounds like we can work something out when the time comes
5348976 before we came into the match our coach said the mission for the mens team final is a must win task
5348977 we have worked very hard and our performance is very good thats why we achieved the final victory and that makes me very happy
5348978 it was our strategy that we must win this gold medal because that demonstrates the power of our country
5348979 we have accomplished just one half of our pre set target the future battles will be even more difficult even more challenging but we will try our utmost to win all of the gold medals
5348980 we are very very happy at this moment this is the maximum that you can reach in the team event china they are the best team in the world you have to accept it
5348981 we are really really happy because this is the first team match and we got the bronze medal i thank very much my teammates and the coaching staff
5348982 we expect the animation market to grow due to the opening of multiplexes globalisation and the increase in the reach of television in the future in india
5348983 india is getting a lot of outsourced work from other countries but for want of trained animators they are not in a position to execute all those orders so the industry is demanding this kind of academy
5348984 i am enjoying my football again we have a good manager levein who is keen to get things going and take the club forward
5348985 he wants to challenge the old firm and although we have only played two games i do not see why we cannot do that
5348986 celtic are champions and a huge club but at the end of the day it is 11 against 11 and i do not care who it is
5348987 thats what i believe and the way i treat every game as a player you want to play against big teams and big games
5348988 now i know a bit about celtic and hopefully that experience will help me against scotland should i get a chance
5348989 however that is football and you cannot go on about it these things happen and you have to move on we will certainly take a lot of positives from the match
5348990 everyone will be looking to put down a marker against scotland with the campaign coming up
5348991 it gives the fringe players a good chance to get in there and perhaps leave the manager with something to think about with the qualifier to come in three weeks
5348992 we will not be treating it as a friendly against scotland as we want to get into good habits and win this game
5348993 i love playing for my country it is the highlight of any players career it would be great to start but that is the managers decision
5348994 the fact we are playing one of the home nations in scotland makes it special as well and something i would love to be part of
5348995 dundee united is a good club and my family are settled
5348996 a small change in the track of the storm could make a big difference in the eventual landfall location
5348997 we have ordained in the torah that a life should be taken for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and wounds are to be punished by qisas exact retribution or retaliation
5348998 take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant
5348999 do not ask me questions as long as i leave you alone
5349000 seek the guidance of your heart istaftii qalbaka ask for the fatwa whatever opinion others may give
5349001 do not ask us about those things that if they were shown or declared to you could bring you wrong or trouble you
5349002 o prophet why do you declare illicit what god has made licit simply to give satisfaction to your wives
5349003 he granteth wisdom to whom he pleaseth and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing but none will grasp the message but men of understanding
5349004 each one does according to his rule of conduct and thy lord is best aware of the one whose way is right
5349005 true believers are only those who have faith in allah and his messenger and have left doubt behind and who strive hard in allahs cause with their possessions and their lives they are the ones who are sincere 49 15
5349006 and if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas to help it were ink the words of allah could not be exhausted
5349007 truly the quran has an outward and an inward dimension and the latter has its own inward dimension and so on up to seven dimensions
5349008 and as for those who disbelieve their deeds are like the mirage in a desert which the thirsty man deems to be water until when he comes to it he finds it to be naught and there he finds allah so he pays back to him his reckoning in full and allah is quick in reckoning
5349009 he it is who has revealed the book to you some of the verses are decisive they are the basis of the book and others are allegorical then in those whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical seeking to mislead and seeking to give it their own interpretation but none knows the interpretation except allah and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say we believe in it it is from our lord and none do mind except those having understanding
5349010 he that is god it is who hath revealed unto thee muhammad the scripture wherein are clear revelations they are the substance of the book and others which are allegorical but those in whose hearts is doubt pursue forsooth that which is allegorical seeking to cause dissension by seeking to explain it none knows its explanation save allah and those who are of sound instruction say we believe therein the whole is from our lord but only men of understanding really heed
5349011 and know that this is my path the right one therefore follow it and follow not other ways for they will lead you away from his way this he has enjoined you with that you may guard against it
5349012 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5349013 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5349014 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5349015 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
5349016 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
5349017 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
5349018 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
5349019 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
5349020 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
5349021 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
5349022 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
5349023 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
5349024 its basically the same process as at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
5349025 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
5349026 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
5349027 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
5349028 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
5349029 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
5349030 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many
5349031 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
5349032 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
5349033 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
5349034 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
5349035 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
5349036 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
5349037 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
5349038 ph d s are as likely as loch ness monster ghosts etc
5349039 many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes or that they dont work if there is a non believer in the room
5349040 whatever communications we abrogate or cause to be forgotten we bring one better than it or like it do you not know that allah has power over all things
5349041 and when we change one communication for another and allah knows best what he reveals they say you are only a forger nay most of them do not know
5349042 they ask you muhammad about wine and gambling say in both there is sin and utility for people
5349043 o ye who believe do not come to pray when you are in a state of intoxication till you know what you utter
5349044 o ye who believe intoxicants and games of chance and sacrificing to stones set up and divining by arrows are only an uncleanness the work of shaitan shun it therefore that you may be successful
5349045 whoever submits ones whole self to allah and is a doer of good has grasped the most trustworthy handhold
5349046 bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives according to usage a duty incumbent on those who guard against evil
5349047 so we shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like turn then your face to the sacred mosque and wherever you are turn your face towards it
5349048 prayer is the sacrifice whereby every believer comes closer to allah
5349049 during the affliction of ibn az zubair which took place after the prophet had passed away two men came to ibn umar and said
5349050 what stops me is that allah has prohibited the shedding of my brothers blood
5349051 didnt allah say and fight then until there is no more affliction
5349052 we fought until there was no more affliction and so that worship would be for allah alone while you want to fight until there is affliction and until the worship becomes for other than allah
5349053 worship at fixed times has been enjoined on the believers
5349054 your irc client did not support a password please type quote pass yourpassword to connect

5349056 was the only woman on our list of disappeared people just the fact that this was a pakistani woman suggests that this is siddiqui its not proof but it raises the possibility
5349057 as the department of justice has said this individual was not in u s custody before she was detained on july 17 2008
5349058 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 21 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be
5349059 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples common sense
5349060 a 16 year old saudi girl drank a bottle of bleach in an attempt to commit suicide to escape a forced marriage to a 75 year old man press reports revealed sunday
5349061 political issue might help them disguise their hidden devious war on all jews
5349062 we are a nation that drinks blood and we know theres no better blood than the blood of the jews
5349063 our children are being sent into the streets to face heavily armed israeli soldiers
5349064 the palestinian authority must put an end to this phenomenon we urge you to issue instructions to your police force to stop sending innocent children to their death
5349065 we dont send children nobody can send children and we dont hide behind children
5349066 when school finishes palestinian authority security cars go around collecting children from the streets and sending them to the killing fields
5349067 this is very serious because they are children and they are unarmed
5349068 as the number of those killed rises the palestinian media extol and exalt not only those killed but also their willingness to die as martyrs for allah emphasizing that dying a martyrs death was the realization of their hopes
5349069 chairman yasser arafat who is ruthlessly encouraging the involvement of children in the violence calls them the generals of the rocks he would have the world believe that israel with its guns and helicopters is waging a war against 10 year olds with small stones
5349070 in truth however the children are used as human shields for the gunmen bomb throwers and lynch mobs whose faces have been totally obscured and invisible to the media
5349071 there has been an overwhelming agreement among palestinian factions to carry out a public awareness campaign to prevent those children under 16 years old from taking part in these demonstrations
5349072 good that jews are concentrated all in one place israel so it easier to exterminate them
5349073 evangelicals need to hew even more closely to the most conservative and literalist standards of the bible they need to stop making nice to attract seekers they need to unload the slackers
5349074 hew even more closely to the most conservative and literalist standards of the bible
5349075 doesnt belong on muslim land in the all muslim middle east
5349076 i cant expect from the arabs any better but israel should know better
5349077 advocates for israel try to silence critics by labeling them anti semitic
5349078 they said of rabbi yochanan ben zakai that no man ever greeted him first even idol worshippers in the market
5349079 it is proper to support the idol worshippers during the sabbatical year and to inquire after their welfare commentators even on the days of the holidays of their idols even if they do not keep the seven noahide commandments because of the ways of peace
5349080 but we learned r meir says whence do we learn that a gentile who is occupied in the torah the reference is to those commandments which apply to gentiles is like the high priest as it says a proof text is given
5349081 he rabbi akiva was accustomed to say beloved is man commentators the reference is to all mankind for he was created in image
5349082 it is more grievous to steal from a gentile because of the desecration of name
5349083 one who sees a lost donkey of an idol worshipper must take care of it exactly the way he takes care of the lost donkey of an israelite
5349084 and not only the tribe of levy merits special closeness to g d but every single person of those who walk the earth who walks straight in the manner g d created him behold this person is sanctified as the holy of holies and he will receive his reward in the world to come as the priests and levites
5349085 even if our sages had not explicitly taught that righteous gentiles have a place in the world to come as we learn in sanhedrin 105 and maimonides chapter 8 of the laws of kings we would have understood this ourselves since g d is righteous in all his ways and we see many of the righteous gentiles who not only recognize the creator and believe in the divine origin of the torah and also act charitably we will say something which is a commandment to publicize for behold some of the them have done tremendous good for all mankind such as yenner who invented the which saves tens of thousands of people from disease and death and deformities and draka who brought the potato to europe thus saving people from hunger and gutenberg who invented the printing press and some who never received any reward in this world such as the righteous reuchlin who risked his life to prevent the burning of the talmud can anyone imagine that these great deeds are not repaid in the world to come
5349086 do not target say the sinners should vanish but rather the sins should vanish from earth
5349087 who is a wise man he who learns of all men
5349088 join the company of lions rather than assume the lead among foxes
5349089 if a person gives his friend all the gifts in the world with a sour face he has given him nothing but one who receives his friend with a cheerful face even if he has given him nothing else has given him the greatest gift in the world

5349093 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
5349094 theres no other purpose to the cross no communication no particular message it was intended to cause fear and to terrorize a population
5349095 regardless of what obama might say about particular decisions obamas justices would not only presumably make up these new rights they would strip us of our second amendment rights while giving child rapists more rights and taking away the rights of the people through their legislators to make these important decisions
5349096 i knew that in washington what matters is not what you do but what people can be made to think youve done
5349097 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution

5349099 we are not fighting to chase out the occupier or to save national unity and keep the borders outlined by the infidels intact

5349106 when you enter the land kill neither old men women nor children establish a covenant with every people and city who receive you peacefully give them your assurances and let them live according to their laws
5349107 this is my way i call to god i and whoever follows me being certain
5349108 and why do they make you muhammad the judge when they have the taurat wherein is allahs judgment
5349109 and the followers of the injeel should have judged by what allah revealed in it and whoever did not judge by what allah revealed those are they who are transgressors
5349110 judge between them or turn aside from them and if you turn aside from them they will not harm you in any way and if you should decide to serve as a judge then judge between them with equity surely god loves those who judge equitably
5349111 the companions of the messenger of allah disagreed about the branches and dispersed to different countries and each one is correct
5349112 the people have handed over to them positions and they heard hadith and they examined reports and each people takes what was handed over to them and they yield to allah with it so leave the people alone and what they choose for themselves in every country
5349113 for every one of you did we appoint a law and a way and if allah had wished he would have made you a single people but that he might try you in what he gave you therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds to allah is your return of all so he will let you know that in which you differed
5349114 listen to me ye people those of you who worshipped muhammad know that he is dead like any other mortal but those of you who worship the god of muhammad peace and blessings be upon him know that he is alive and would live forever
5349115 and muhammad is no more than an apostle apostles have already passed away before him if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels and whoever turns back upon his heels he will by no means do harm to allah in the least and allah will reward the grateful
5349116 say this is the truth from your lord then whoever wills let him believe and whoever wills let him disbelieve
5349117 you shall remind you are entrusted to remind you are not a watcher over them
5349118 say obey allah and obey the messenger if they refuse then he is responsible for his obligations and you are responsible for your obligations if you obey him you will be guided
5349119 the guiding of them is not thy duty o muhammad but allah guides whom he will
5349120 o believers obey allah obey the rasool and those charged with authority among you should you have a dispute in anything refer it to allah and his rasool if you truly believe in allah and the last day this course of action will be better and more suitable
5349121 obey me as long as i obey allah and his prophet when i disobey him and his prophet then obey me not
5349122 fight in the cause of allah those who fight you but do not transgress the limits for god does not love the transgressors quran 2 190
5349123 and fight them till there is no more oppression and deen should only be for allah but if they desist then there should be no hostility except against the oppressor
5349124 the blame is only against those who oppress human beings with wrong doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land defying right and justice
5349125 call to the way of your lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and have disputations with them in the best manner

5349183 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5349186 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
5349187 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad networks cpms cost per thousand impressions

5349232 or where were they when they made that rosie odonnell riding the bus with my sister film because that was way worse in my eyes than our film
5349233 you are just a tired stressed out single mom looking for a quick fix
5349234 hierdoor worden we gedwongen ons als vee door electronische poortjes te laten draven terwijl al onze persoonlijke gegevens van een chip op een pasje worden afgelezen niemand die er om gevraagd heeft en iets te kiezen valt er uiteraard niet

5349236 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them

5349239 from the perspective of neurotypicals those with aspergers can seem literal concrete and rigid from the perspective of those with asperger syndrome neurotypicals can be unclear inexact people who do not say what they mean and who expect you to know things they never tell you
5349240 a basic value in good parenting know and accept the child you have for whom he is and help him to exist in the world as it is this is difficult enough it is impossible to help a child to be something that is alien to him
5349241 i may have been looking for projection in our play but what i got was information projective psychological testing presents a similar situation for children or anyone with asperger syndrome the responses of these children are more likely to be concrete information about the stimulus than true projections of the self it is important to me that psychologists who are testing the children i see be aware of that if the percepts and stories these children produce are seen as projective the child may be seen as disturbed in ways that are not accurate
5349242 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5349243 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system
5349244 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5349245 its the most recent class a building built in torrance
5349246 there are few south bay locations better than our current one but im convinced our new offices will be even more advantageous for our employees customers and overall presence in the community
5349247 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5349248 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
5349249 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever

5349252 but a portion implies not a source of ordinary pleasure but of rest and satisfaction such as leaves nothing else to be desired

5349254 multitudes live for the world forget god and die this is their history
5349255 if ever delays are dangerous much more are they in this concern of eternity
5349256 do you praise god when you find his word powerfully at work in your life

5349270 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5349271 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5349272 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5349273 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5349274 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5349275 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5349284 demand for metals relate to domestic economy and infrastructure and as we see more people in china migrating from the countryside to the cities there will be a greater need for materials for construction and power stations
5349285 in other words china might be smaller than the united states in gdp terms but it grows at twice the rate

5349321 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5349322 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5349323 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5349324 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5349325 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5349326 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5349327 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5349328 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5349329 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5349330 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5349331 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5349332 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5349333 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5349334 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5349335 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5349336 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5349337 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5349338 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5349339 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5349340 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5349341 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5349342 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5349343 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5349344 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5349345 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5349346 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5349347 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5349348 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5349349 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5349350 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5349351 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5349352 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5349353 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5349354 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5349355 i think voters have to make the decision based on studying the issue and studying the person and try to best decide the challenges they face in their life
5349356 if anything is more sacrilegious its to claim to be a believer of god and put someone in a tent city because of their ethnic persuasion
5349357 i believe there is a proper role of religion in our society and we ought to promote that and not run away from it
5349358 but i dont think its appropriate to guess which candidate jesus christ would support thats sacrilegious to me

5349361 john adler says we need to lower gas prices but he raises taxes on fuel john adler says we need to make living in more affordable but his 43 tax increases since 2002 have made this state anything but
5349362 if they arent using the money they already have properly then why in the world would john adler vote to raise fuel taxes on consumers and give the n j dep even more taxpayer money to sit on
5349363 its typical dysfunction and john adler has been a big part of it for 16 years
5349364 take a long look in the mirror before making any of these silly charges
5349365 mayor myers an incurable practitioner of the old politics as usual blame game continues to blame john adler for every problem under the sun yet he staunchly sides with george w bush and his cronies in big oil companies at every turn
5349366 why would mayor myers object to asking transporters of hazardous materials to pay their fair share in the cleanup of spills can he possibly believe that those who cause the discharge of hazardous materials shouldnt be held accountable
5349367 mayor myers has chosen to go to bat for polluters and stand by a president whose glaring failure to promote energy independence is causing enormous suffering among middle class working families in the 3rd district
5349368 chris myers commitment to protecting big oil and polluters astounds me the spill act is a way to ensure that taxpayers dont get caught holding the bag when there is a hazardous materials spill this is just another example of chris myers marching lockstep with the bush administration and carrying the water for big oil and polluters at the expense of working middle class families

5349388 another very nice middle class family home available only to the super rich sigh brooklyn is screwed up
5349389 so if you have your own kitchen and bath and individual ownership of the unit how is this different than any other new condo development with community rooms gyms lounges pools libraries etc
5349390 dont live with anyone you aint screwin theyll just piss you off
5349391 i can confirm that each unit will have its own kitchen bathroom etc and access to great common space including courtyards common hall a restaurant scale kitchen for special events yes with commercial dishwasher workshops bike racks etc
5349392 a co house is intentionally setup by a group of like minded persons who want more social interaction than casual meetings in the lobby the pool or at board meetings
5349393 co housing is not a project by certain people for others it is a project by specific people for themselves and no one else
5349394 co housing represents a small step towards people attempting to solve problems for themselves in their own way
5349395 why are you here again in one of the most expensive cities in the world and what do you do for a living
5349396 they are very different because gated communities and condo associations are exclusionary groups based on a circle the wagons approach to living you have to have a certain level of assets and then they are all about protecting their stuff and protecting their neighbors stuff as long as it is in their self interest
5349397 crown heights is very big and some parts of ok other parts arent
5349398 many of the homes have been owned by black families since the dawn of time well maybe slightly less and many of these families are today the core of business and professional people who have stabilized the area and gotten landmark status for chn all the news about crown heights focuses on the problems and there is a vast largely ignored working and middle class that has always been here
5349399 many of the newbies moving in seem to operate in a cultural vacuum here their only interest is in their house or apartment not the neighborhood per se
5349400 yeah petebklyn that photo certainly is not indicative of the vast majority of crown heights blocks i know the area pretty well and i dont know where this is at all
5349401 its a less known aspect of crown heights north that many of the homes have been owned by black families since the dawn of time well maybe slightly less and many of these families are today the core of business and professional people who have stabilized the area and gotten landmark status for chn
5349402 this has been a fill in the blank for race ethnicity
5349403 why the heck do either of these women keep living there
5349404 what i dont like is the fighting i could be lying in my bed and hear shooting down the block there are times when i go to work i have to step over someone who doesnt even live in the building because they passed out
5349405 ow because so many people have moved in and the wealth gap is very visible i think that presents a different kind of crime crimes of opportunity if youre walking down the street and talking into your iphone where people have so much less that presents a different kind of danger im not saying im surrounded by potential criminals but it is weird to see that intense wealth gap
5349406 of course for some er younger people the 50s is the dawn of time
5349407 but my impression of the area has always been that race and street crime were real problems and unlike a not of other neighborhoods in the city the source of the problem was the neighborhood itself
5349408 its a less known aspect of crown heights north that many of the homes have been owned by black families since the dawn of time well maybe slightly less
5349409 maybe slightly less was supposed to indicate as i explained youre misinterpreting
5349410 arent you forgetting the huge west indian population that lives there too
5349411 i get really tired of posters doing interpretations based on their own biases or neuroses on brownstoner
5349412 there were people who thought crown heights if stabilized could represent a new kind of community
5349413 its not worth my time to even scroll back up
5349414 how come we dont buy into most of this sh t
5349415 thats where we learned that appearances have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of things
5349416 it must suck to go through life as a moron
5349417 the upgrade will incorporate additional beachfront villas recreation water sports and entertainment facilities
5349418 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
5349419 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
5349420 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
5349421 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
5349422 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed
5349423 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
5349424 we are not against consolidation but this alliance is on a scale never seen before ba aa with iberia wont create fair play so we say no way ba aa
5349425 my job is to attend to the secular needs of the population yours is to the spiritual needs i dont tell you how to do you job and i dont expect you to tell me how to do mine my specific belief system must remain private if im to serve all the people fairly
5349426 it just doesnt make any sense especially with the safe surrender laws
5349427 none of us had much time to think about it it just turned in for us the canadians made us work for it
5349428 david maisels photographs of nearly 110 funereal copper canisters are a mineralogical delight
5349429 i think south korea is a typical fiba asia type of team that likes great ball movement and they take advantage of any outside looks they get
5349430 a lot of what they do is perimeter oriented even though they have a few decent post players they dont like to play with their backs to the baskets they face up to the basket and they take you off the dribble there will be a lot of movement and we will be challenged to contain them on the perimeter and in the post but i think we are strong enough to impose our will on them
5349431 i think the biggest is that weve talked about as most asians teams they south korea are very good at shooting the three ball and shot fakes
5349432 tonight we struggled a lot with the shot fake going out of control and they got a lot of open shots that way thats one of the things that were really going to have to focus on they move the ball really well and the play team ball i played over in south korea for four years so some of the players ive actually played with theyve been on my team im looking forward to playing against them
5349433 there are many issues and it will take multiple pieces of legislation that will have to happen to address those issues
5349434 if grassroots isnt working ill try a new approach but this approach is viable the public is ready for one of their own
5349435 it doesnt depend on the money it wouldnt occur to me to do it for the money the constituents are more important than i am that sense of community is bigger than us when there are over 800 of you referring to her donors every vote is equally powerful our political system has forgotten about the people
5349436 it feels like it should be a separate line on the ballot
5349437 the media is missing the story that a vast majority of americans are suffering when i connect with people they get it im different the concern they express to me is will the machine keep eating us up people tell me i am what they need but they ask me if i really want to go there they ask me if i really want to walk into the lions den heres my proof and its a ziploc baggy
5349438 i plan on going to albany to change albany not to be changed by albany

5349442 ils ont en fait ralenti le travail en cours et provoqu laugmentation des abus

5349446 todos los pa ses aliados en una forma u otra hemos dicho que debe haber alg n tipo de consecuencia en nuestra relaci n con rusia
5349447 necesitamos evaluar cu l deber a ser nuestra cooperaci n con rusia
5349448 no buscamos una relaci n de adversario con rusia no buscamos congelar el consejo otan rusia pero tampoco podemos seguir adelante en las circunstancias actuales no podemos mantener relaciones normales con tropas rusas sobre el terreno
5349449 queremos que los rusos apliquen lo que los dirigentes rusos han dicho que van a hacer
5349450 el alto el fuego requiere la retirada de todas las fuerzas rusas del territorio georgiano

5349462 the unusual design of the flex which has just started arriving at dealerships is aimed at attacking one of the biggest problems facing detroits big three what is known in the industry as
5349463 to spiff up the interior the company tapped a fashion designer anthony prozzi who suggested putting tweed panels on the doors to create a warm hand crafted look inspired by a fine mens suit the flex has a few other surprising features too like an optional small refrigerator and an improved navigation system that locates gas stations with the cheapest prices but its roominess remains one of its top selling points according to dealers
5349464 i am calling on fingal county council to introduce new guidelines on the size of apartments that can be built by developers for too long apartment developments in the dublin 15 area have focused on large numbers of small one and two bedroom apartments these shoebox developments are not family friendly and this discourages families settling for long periods and in the long run prevents communities from forming
5349465 recently dublin city council drew up a new set of guidelines for the city area developments built according to these guidelines will be far more conducive to families for example they set significantly larger minimum floor sizes for apartments place restrictions on the number of one bed apartments and require a minimum of 15 3 bed apartments in all developments
5349466 i believe that in areas like dublin 15 which have seen large amounts of intensive building we have to make sure that any new apartment developments are of a much higher standard than those built up to now in recent weeks we have seen a planning application in castleknock village which includes 48 one and two bed apartments but only 1 three bed apartment this sort of development needs to be changed
5349467 at the recent meeting of fingal county council concerning the kellystown rezoning the green party councillors secured a commitment from gilbert power director of services for planning that the council would quickly draw up new apartment guidelines for fingal i am calling on the council to quickly act on this commitment
5349468 hey guys this is matt he knows anthony he will be training with us for a week

5349473 even with jet lag congress not letting us drill makes no sense to me
5349474 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
5349475 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
5349476 i still hope i can cause the national flag to be raised
5349477 they can have a job or position in the sport bureau or any kind of government branch in charge of sport and games
5349478 so they are guaranteed a good life even after their retirement
5349479 he had enough money and fame already so he found a way out
5349480 after li ning fell off the vaulting horse in the seoul olympics in 1988 lots of people wrote him letters cursing him
5349481 someone even sent him a rope to hang himself but now theres been a huge change people are much more tolerant
5349482 after this games chinese people will not be as interested as before in olympic medals we are proud enough
5349483 why i should care about your product is left to the end of the presentation

5349498 jack san you want yojis advice about the babes you come to yoji with respect
5349499 keep up the great work i check your site very frequently
5349500 hey its going to be a full moon saturday do you think it would be okay to go out to the sandspit
5349501 i want to take julia and india 2 young ladies out there and show them all the cool stuff
5349502 great idea you have a 9 00 pm low tide so its just about perfect go and have a good time
5349503 do the stingray shuffle when wading the slough between the shore and the sandspit
5349504 most important pay attention to your time you have an hour before and after dead low tide to wander aimlessly then you need to be walking back in with the incoming tide
5349505 i think the great thing with this team is we use pressure as motivation
5349506 i have routinely been vilified by the biased liberal media by the state democratic party and even by the liberal tax and spend members of my own party why because i promised to cut the car tax and i did
5349507 it makes sense from a strategic standpoint when youre trailing a candidate in the polls and in the fundraising in the way that gilmore is trailing warner at this point you have to attack from all angles and see whats going to catch on
5349508 go through the policy differences go through the ideology differences go through the character issues if there are any there gilmore is raising the issue of trust can you take a candidate at his word based on the car tax issue raising taxes or not raising taxes once in office
5349509 elections are about the future and rarely ever about the past and what matters in this election are energy prices the economy health care education crime people want to talk about whats going on at their kitchen table not some previous fights from years past
5349510 i think most virginians will tell you that while they were grateful to have their car tax cut they still want more its like the old janet jackson song what have you done for me lately they want todays problems solved they dont want to dredge up the problems of the late 90s this is the late aughts
5349511 the only difficulty with the car tax was that for whatever reason the administrations starting with the gilmore administration werent able to phase it out completely and the general assembly hasnt been able to do that either although there have been some efforts to do that in the past and with the budget situation its probably not going to be something that would be doable at least at this point
5349512 at this point people have thought about it and certainly made up their mind as to how they feel it fits into virginia politics in general and how it affects which candidate they will support so its unlikely to have an effect in terms of shifting support in one direction or another
5349513 its certainly going to ring true with the anti tax wing of the republican party and that portion of the electorate but its probably not going to convert any undecided voters of which there dont seem to be a whole lot of right now at least in the senate cycle
5349514 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5349515 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5349516 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5349517 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5349518 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5349519 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5349520 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5349521 real programmers just throw a bunch of 1s and 0s at the computer to see what sticks
5349522 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
5349523 it is well to remember that the entire universe with one trifling exception is composed of others
5349524 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5349525 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5349526 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5349527 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5349528 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5349529 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5349530 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5349531 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5349532 it just seems inexplicable that this whole thing has been such an issue but clearly the mccain campaign wants this to be an issue wants to paint him as someone whos unfeeling about the troops
5349533 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
5349534 to contend homosexuality or other sexually alternative practices are as worthy of special protections as religion is like saying feculence is as important to ones person or the culture as food
5349535 smoke from the mendocino fire complex that has filled the air in sonoma county for several weeks is actually protecting the vines by decreasing the impact of the hot temperature spikes
5349536 freezing temperatures in healdsburg dipped to 23 degrees in the spring followed by searing heat during bloom and three weeks of high winds that combined for the loss of one quarter to one third of the wine grape crop our company manages
5349537 were currently conducting bunch counts to get a hard estimate on this years production
5349538 there is a great interest in high end clients going organic
5349539 organic wine grape production costs up to 25 percent more than conventional
5349540 our goal is producing very high quality fruit that commands a premium price for our clients
5349541 when were establishing a vineyard we seriously consider various issues including spacing row orientation and planting the best rootstock in specific soils and locations
5349542 were learning that too much light exposure can come from an overly tight vertical trellis system so were experimenting with different kinds of cross arms on trellises
5349543 instead of having the wire press the canes tight together theres a slightly wider panel of foliage that goes above the fruit which provides more shade for the grapes
5349544 the vine mealybug is a huge new headache for wine grape growers
5349545 fortunately we dont have it in any of our parcels yet but we expect to see it at some point
5349546 wildfires only good curveball thrown to sonoma county wine grape growers
5349547 they have rallied the cause of cross industry cross community collaboration for years

5349580 eu tive uma fase dura na escola a ponto de errar tudo de n o ter talento
5349581 it actually came up when i was about 8 months pregnant and i was beached like a whale
5349582 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5349583 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5349584 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5349585 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5349586 maybe we live in a world riddled with logos because symbols are something that we enjoy desire and even need
5349587 understand that in the twenty first centruy we still grapple with the eternal dilemma of wanting to feel like individuals and to feel as though were part of something bigger than ourselves and that most of all we all seek ways to resolve this fundamental tension of life
5349588 when something is aesthetically beautiful people react and when you can assign a meaning and value to something and summarize or capture all of that instantly thats something that i think human nature just gloms on to
5349589 the outlaw feels helpless and seeks the experience of power even if only in the ability to shock or defy others

5349617 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen
5349618 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me they know they cant win on the issues so what theyll do is theyll try to scare people hes risky hes risky were not sure
5349619 not only do you have a candidate who doesnt take any guff not only do you have a candidate who will hit back swiftly and forcefully and truthfully
5349620 but youve also got american people who are rising up all over the country and saying
5349621 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5349622 there is too much at stake to let this problem derail a global trade package that could expand economic growth and opportunity by cutting subsidies drastically lowering tariffs significantly and opening up services markets

5349631 ik heb het boek uit en vond het spannend tot de laatste bladzijde het verhaal is vlot en makkelijk leesbaar geschreven en de spanning opbouw was prima voor een thriller een origineel en onderhoudend verhaal lekker recht voor zijn raap geschreven geen moeilijke verwikkelingen wel erg veel ellende inderdaad vrouwen en kindermishandeling ongeveer op de helft dacht ik al in de gaten te hebben hoe het zou aflopen en ik had het goed geraden en omdat het recht uiteindelijk zegeviert heeft het een bevredigend einde behalve dan hoofdstuk 30 over eva lind dat moest ook nog even af gehandeld worden en sloeg naar mijn gevoel echt nergens op of zou dat typisch ijslands zijn de hele rechercheur elendur vond ik eigenlijk een overbodige personage jammer dat die vrouwelijke rechercheur el nborg die veel vaker in beeld kwam helemaal niet is uitgewerkt als persoonlijkheid we weten niets over haar behalve een zeer korte persoon beschrijving ergens in het begin en dan sigurour oli met dat ijslandse teken op de o van de ou dat je uitspreekt als een engelse th in that die steeds werd lastig gevallen door zijn hitsige vrouw hoe liep het af met hen oeps vergeten dat lijntje is er blijkbaar ook tussen geplaatst om het verhaal te vullen
5349632 ik vond het zelfs boeiender geschreven dan het graf van mankell en ook al zijn er bijzonder veel overeenkomsten tussen deze 2 verhalen ze lijken totaal niet op elkaar
5349633 we are pleased to see that two thirds of sbc churches are offering some level of medical coverage for their ministers and families
5349634 what is most rewarding is recognizing the number of smaller churches that understand that this is an important benefit for the overall financial well being of their ministers
5349635 average worship attendance accounts for the most variance in pastor salaries 54 percent
5349636 the membership of the congregation is the next most significant factor accounting for 50 percent of salary variance church budget also explains a noticeable amount of variation 35 percent
5349637 its no surprise that pastors who have the additional responsibility of leading a larger church are paid more but it is surprising how seldom churches reward experience
5349638 compared to a pastor serving in the south a full time senior pastor in the midwest on average receives 2 124 fewer dollars of total compensation a pastor in the northeast receives 6 978 more and a pastor in the west receives 3 795 more
5349639 a full time senior pastor who does not have a seminary degree on average receives 3 660 fewer dollars in total compensation than a pastor with a seminary degree
5349640 a pastor who has a doctoral degree on average receives 10 015 more than a pastor with a high school education
5349641 the sbc church compensation study is an important resource for churches to use as they seek to determine appropriate salaries for their staff members
5349642 our prayer is that churches will use it both as they seek to hire new staff but also as they retain existing staff to ensure their compensation is competitive with other churches and within their communities
5349643 it was amazing shes such a great singer and great musician
5349644 it was such great fun its always good to be back in new plymouth
5349645 you hear all these stories about people going to australia for a 30 40 or even 50 pay rise we want people to stay here and earn a decent wage
5349646 because they have no authority to be on our property
5349647 nothings happened and weve given them more than enough time the occupiers have nothing to do with that group
5349648 provided we had 75 of the pa palisades erected by july 2008 but they kept putting obstacles in our way and i have not been prepared to commit machinery for the job i am not prepared to discuss details of those obstacles without first consulting my committee
5349649 we instructed our lawyer today to apply for a court injunction to stop the land sale
5349650 we are also starting a petition to show the level of community support that exists for a new trust to take over and complete this project
5349651 we have a purchaser that i decline to name we have no intention of taking the river pa project any further
5349652 if some other group wants to they wont be doing it on our property using our assets
5349653 its going nowhere there comes a time when you have to say stop enough is enough this is ridiculous the capacity isnt out there
5349654 we want to wind up our affairs we have not decided what we will do with the money but there are endless options
5349655 i was one of the volunteer labourers on the river pa project our hopes were raised but were all back on the dole now the trustees have lost nothing theyve got paying jobs
5349656 its such a liberating feeling to not have to worry about the price of gas

5349672 the march of the hurriyat conference and the separatists to the un office and attempts to internationalise the situation is unfortunate

5349705 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5349706 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5349707 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5349708 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5349709 we were trying to lay expectations down that weve seen this coming for a couple of years and certainly didnt want anyone to be shocked

5349720 bush also announced that a massive humanitarian effort was already in progress and would involve american aircraft and naval forces a military cargo plane loaded with supplies is already on the way and bush said that russia must ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports remain open to let deliveries and civilians these are the right moves by our president he is sending aid monitoring the situation and sending his top cabinet members to assess the situation first hand obviously though repercussions for russia are an absolute must punishment ideas against russia include removing them from the g 8 group of industrialized nations taking away their hosting of the 2014 winter olympic games or playing hard ball with their relationship with the north atlantic treaty organization
5349721 whatever our response as a nation and civilized world one thing needs to be clear that the united states of america wants to peacefully support all civilized nations achieve prosperity democracy and security over the last six years we have stumbled down a turbulent path that can only be leveled out with continuous and consistent support for international bodies allies and burgeoning democracies that being said the us government must tread carefully so not to upset or further derail our struggling economy aid and a military presence are two different things when it comes to the economic impact at home nobody even the hardest hawks out there believes our country economically or otherwise can handle another military bout at the moment
5349722 yes the united states is limited in what we can do to solve this crisis but the very fact that we are taking a proactive approach by sending humanitarian workers and aid working with the un and nato and sending top aids to the region shows a commitment to international peace and prosperity this is the america that we must see more of in the future for if we can help solve international dilemmas gain allies and keep our money and manpower at home we will solidify our stance as the greatest country in the world

5349759 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what cricket australia and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5349760 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this
5349761 im sure they will come back to us in the next few days the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5349762 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc
5349763 we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5349764 my quad man it was bad every week you get it better then you go out and play and hurt it again the quad would get weak i was taking those pills for the pain i was running around trying to make plays when its not there the quad is definitely back where it needs to be although
5349765 its just unfortunate that sometimes and its happened to a lot of great players when they play behind a player that had length and longetivity and did it well in a way that people respect they sometimes dont know how to deal with it they dont know where to take it and thats one of those situations where hes trying to carve a niche for himself and he wants that to be so different from me that hes doing a lot of things that i didnt do but those are the things i didnt do because you dont need to not because i didnt want to
5349766 hes a player thats getting continuously better every time we go out hes a much better player this week than he was last week he was better in protections there are still some mistakes that concern you the closer you get to the season but its obviously he can be a big help to us offensively

5349775 thats part of the irrational part rationally if some other company messes consumers around it shouldnt carry over to any other firm and it certainly shouldnt carry over to a well respected brand that has a good reputation with consumers already
5349776 what was so disconcerting about our research is we found that these suspicions are powerful enough to carry over equally to those brands theyre as vulnerable as any other company knowing that is something that marketing managers will be shocked by
5349777 really become so suspicious that they start suspecting their friends in a sense they start not recognizing good products anymore
5349778 given that consumers are normally exposed to over 500 ads per day the results of this study suggest that a single instance of advertising correction has the potential to undermine a relatively large number of advertisements
5349779 contrary to the goal of maintaining truth in advertising and reassuring the marketplace that advertising can be trusted corrective advertising may actually have exactly the opposite effect
5349780 in the end regulators will have to weigh the cost of having uninformed consumers who maintain erroneous product beliefs against the potential damage that correction can do to the advertising industry as a whole to honest advertisers in particular and even consumers themselves

5349789 when youre in the studio with wayne you could pretty much chill man because everything is so easy hes so melody driven once he hits you with an idea or i come up with an idea were straightforward man the process is easy i think me and him could do an album probably in like seven days a classic album he keeps it 100 i keep it 100 were both talented mcs i appreciate him in hip hop
5349790 i like the way he evolved if you go back to little lil wayne to now you can see the dramatic changes hes everywhere what the f can you do besides come behind him i dont ever put nobody before myself i feel im the greatest alive i hold it down but wayne hes got it right now so i dont mind stepping behind for a minute until its my turn when its my turn my albums gonna run his down and well go at it again next time

5349861 ultimately it is about the greater good of the community
5349862 a municipality can say no to the application but then it goes to the ontario municipal board
5349863 wind farm projects have never been rejected at the omb
5349864 i am trying to decide there are a group of us right now and we have to approach it with an open mind
5349865 georgian troops planned to occupy southern ossetia in a blitzkrieg operation modelled after croatias
5349866 the georgian army performed so poorly in the field that a military fait accompli on day one was out of the question it could not even secure the ossetian capital tskhinvali which lay virtually undefended within miles of the georgian border
5349867 actively involved at all levels of planning training and equipping the georgian army the us could not have not known what was coming
5349868 if saakashvili acted in the hope of a decisive political and even military american response to russias predictable reaction he is naive if he willingly accepted the role of collateral damage in the scenario of discrediting russia he is stupid and if he thought that he could do a tudjman with impunity he is insane
5349869 if it was a trap and theres good reason to think it was he walked right into it
5349870 its deplorable simply deplorable to fire on civilians like that and illegal
5349871 in the summer we witnessed an increasing number of incidents explosions shooting
5349872 we met the general of the russian peacekeepers and he said that the separatists were not answering the phone
5349873 where were the russian peacekeepers when the south ossetians were shelling the georgian positions
5349874 at 6 i gave the order to prepare everything to go out from the bases
5349875 on thursday thursday afternoon they noticed equipment and troops on the road rolling to karaleti
5349876 we are ready for any sort of agreement in the interest of peace
5349877 from 18 00 georgian troops from inner districts are relocated to the area
5349878 bryza said he was not told that georgian armor was already moving toward the south ossetian line and continued to do so even after saakashvili declared a cease fire
5349879 they felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages it was a very dangerous dynamic that was part of an action reaction guns of august scenario that we tried to defuse
5349880 we started to check and around 11 50 i got confirmation that russian armor was coming in
5349881 to do otherwise he said would have been to cede georgian sovereignty he had no choice he said
5349882 during these intense exchanges between the leadership here and me when they said they were going to lift the cease fire we said dont put your forces in harms way because you cannot prevail
5349883 and the response was we understand that we are going to shell the road on which the russians are approaching and try to keep them back thats what they said
5349884 youd have to have had somebody there with a stopwatch and something overhead at precisely that moment
5349885 its not like a very open and big city and i can tell you that we only targeted the places the governmental organizations
5349886 the bm 21 was designed to attack forces in large areas and as a consequence if you use them in an urban environment the likelihood of collateral damage is high
5349887 when aircraft started bombing our positions in tskhinvali this is when most civilian buildings were burned
5349888 but when we entered we got a very heavy attack what the officers are telling me is that it was something like hell
5349889 i think they had something around 15 to 20 000 in the theater
5349890 i had only 9 000 they were already bringing in new soldiers they had a chance to rest and our soldiers were becoming tired and more tired because i had no additional forces to change them after two days of battle they were too tired
5349891 recognizing kosovo will bring nothing but trouble no one can be denied the right to self determination but only within the bounds of common sense
5349892 there is nothing to record this is a private gathering and reporters are not invited
5349893 we are only muslims who practice islam as did the allahs prophet mohammed
5349894 they always connect us to terrorism but what terrorism have we done
5349895 give me the facts and i will twist them the way i want to suit my argument
5349896 in my view the objective we should pursue is the building up of a strong and peaceful germany which will not attack our french allies but will at the same time serve as a moral bulwark against the bolshevism of russia
5349897 germany as the moral bulwark against the bolshevism of russia
5349898 twenty years after the death of draza mihailovic he is undimmed in his glory as a defender of liberty against the fascist terror who defended it also against the communist terror he had no moment of weakness or of bitterness i know of no instance where he reproached those who were guilty of his betrayal twenty years ago i knew he was innocent of all charges against him and since then i have had many further proofs of his innocence his abandonment was a crime and like all crimes it brought no real profit to the criminals i loved your nation of serbia before the war i have loved and honoured it more and more as the years have gone by and i have seen that the hero whom you gave to history has not his like in our time

5349900 twenty percent of americans now live in homes subject to rules set by homeowner associations or hoas the more restrictive hoas cling to outdated standards that treat necessary features of an ecologically resilient future renewable energy devices clotheslines fans in windows awnings vegetable gardens fruit trees compost bins natural landscaping as eyesores to be buried under restrictions or banned outright but a growing number of state and local governments are deciding that when hoas ban eco friendly practices they violate the property rights of their members and damage everyones right to a habitable planet the energy to restrain overbearing hoas may have to come from the grassroots as families struggle in coming years to keep up with rising grocery and utility bills on top of their mortgage payments and hoa dues they may well put the heat on lawmakers to protect their right to money saving conservation renewable energy and edible landscaping a small but growing number of hoas are actually encouraging green practices
5349901 it is a great sadness to read that the proposed empowerment deal will only be to the benefit of all black sa citizens being a loyal and avid customer of vodacom since the day you opened your doors i was extremely disappointed in the fact that yet again i will be penalised because im a white citizen of this country
5349902 this is a viral campaign with people saying dont support vodacom the black empowerment deal is racist because white people cant participate if people want to be racist to that degree its a war we cant win
5349903 we think it is important that students understand that agriculture offers a great career path

5349910 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5349911 gave both candidates the first two questions because he didnt want them to be nervous so they would be at ease
5349912 ill probably ask you a question on this or on that
5349913 warren felt that since that was basically asking for a commitment he felt that it was fair to tell them in advance that he was going to ask them that
5349914 we arrived at saddleback and went into a holding room which is a separate building from the main church in the room there were four or five staff people plus mccain and there was no tv no audio no nothing we talked through a few of the topics we had spent time in the afternoon preparing doing q amp a and we did a few more questions to warm him up at about ten til six the advance guys came to get mccain to take him to the stage because the handshake with obama was a few minutes before 6 p m mccain never heard any of this stuff
5349915 you didnt have to be a genius to know that we were going to get asked about life marriage personal faith staffing for faith based organizations a log of things we prepared him for didnt come up but a lot of them we anticipated
5349916 we had him prepared and in any given situation mccain is going to use his own instincts and give his own answers it was like a town hall meeting and rick warren was the only person in the meeting

5349930 tomando en cuenta que al final del d a s lo se nos juzga por resultados y despu s de una reuni n con la directiva esta madrugada hemos decidido retirarle a nuestro director t cnico sergio ordu a la presi n que implica un inicio de torneo con cuatro partidos perdidos
5349931 el profesor sergio ordu a a partir de este d a lunes 18 de agosto de 2008 de com n acuerdo con la directiva deja la direcci n t cnica del primer equipo y se incorpora en los pr ximos d as en otra rea deportiva del club
5349932 esperemos tener continuidad esperemos estar dentro del once inicial si no seguir trabajando siguiendo apoyando al grupo sabiendo que es una competencia muy fuerte muy cerrada tenemos que sacar los tres puntos para comenzar a sumar para la calificaci n para el mundial
5349933 s que todos somos jugadores indispensables pero no fundamentales hay muchos jugadores de gran calidad entonces yo voy a seguir trabajando tratando de aportar lo mejor para la selecci n
5349934 tenemos que ganar tenemos que sumar puntos que son important simos hay que empezar con el pie derecho y aqu en casa
5349935 nos fuimos sabiendo que hicimos un gran esfuerzo ya ten amos mucho tiempo que no jug bamos en un horario como este con tanto calor pero el equipo mostr que est bien f sicamente sab amos que ten amos que sumar en este partido nos costaron unos errores pero creo que el accionar del equipo fue bueno a n con un hombre menos nos supimos parar bien en el terreno de juego y creo que es un punto favorable por las condiciones del partido
5349936 esperemos hacer bien las cosas desde un inicio para conseguir el boleto al mundial ser importante sacar un buen resultado y hacer un buen funcionamiento siempre y cuando que nuestra gente no nos deje de apoyar
5349937 ah s vamos a ver en estos momentos s lo puedo decir que ser un partido dif cil pero hay que hablar en la cancha
5349938 sabemos que son equipos que juegan a eso a desesperar a no proponer nada simplemente al contragolpe y desgraciadamente son equipos que consiguen m s puntos de los que merecieran por su futbol
5349939 se molestaban porque est bamos tocando la pelota dec an que no los exhibi ramos cosa que nos da risa pero es la propuesta de chivas salir tocando desde atr s siempre ha sido la trataremos de mantener para que nos siga dando resultado
5349940 la verdad es que yo creo que en el futbol no hay justicia o injusticia creo que es simplemente reflejarlo en el marcador s hicimos un futbol m s ofensivo de m s propuesta que necaxa sorprendi la propuesta de necaxa que con un hombre de m s de locales no arriesg nada pero es parte de los esquemas que cada entrenador plantea para su equipo nosotros la mayor parte del partido tratamos de proponer disputando todos los balones llegando lo m s r pido posible al arco creo que se hizo un buen partido pese a los dos errores que tuvimos atr s
5349941 the last lines crc didnt work or is otherwise bad give it to me again
5349942 the guardian blog on the katine community partnerships project poses a risk to amref as anyone can post comments about the project which could potentially be negative and damaging to amrefs reputation it is therefore crucial that amref has a clear process in place to monitor and respond to postings if required all statements posted on the guardian blog will be coordinated and written centrally by amref in the uk no amref employees should post comments with reference to the uk communications manager
5349943 especially the isolation of one village amongst hundreds of others
5349944 estoy contento por la propuesta que mostr el equipo estoy tranquilo pero triste porque merec amos un mejor resultado nosotros llegamos con toda la intenci n de que la gente saliera contenta s as fue me voy todav a m s contento
5349945 por hacerle una pregunta al cuarto oficial respecto al partido de cuartos de final ante monterrey por eso me ech
5349946 el futbol no ha sido benevolente con nosotros porque no se han dado los resultados mas esto no es de justicia es de ganar los partidos sin embargo veo al equipo en constante crecimiento con esa generosidad en el futbol en la din mica en los movimientos y en estar m s concentrados estoy m s tranquilo con el equipo y vamos por el camino correcto
5349947 de los cuales cuatro han sido en calidad de visitante tampoco en ese sentido el calendario no nos ha beneficiado mucho pero el equipo ha jugado bien as que el balance hasta ahora lo veo positivo sino en resultados por lo menos s en el accionar
5349948 hay que estar con l en las buenas y en las malas los compa eros fueron tan solidarios con l que rescataron un partido que no merec amos perder l se equivoc pero tambi n nos ha salvado en otras ocasiones en otros partidos as que solamente qui n no interviene en un partido no se equivoca
5349949 yo la verdad ya no s qu hacer no s si alzar la voz o hablar chiqueado para que nos tengan respeto los rbitros porque a un mexicano en cuanto decimos algo nos echan
5349950 no pasa nada somos un equipo que al final de cuentas estamos expuestos a esto no pasa nada simplemente eso nos ha ayudado tambi n y tampoco le hab amos dicho nada
5349951 es parte de somos seres humanos y esto es futbol lo importante es que pudimos cobijarle de alguna manera con el empate
5349952 no me voy a meter es respetable lo que ellos hacen les ha funcionado nosotros tambi n debemos de seguir haciendo lo mismo vamos a trabajar ese detallito de los goles hay que mejorarlos
5349953 fueron dos visitas no hay que perder de vista eso fueron cuatro puntos de seis por lo pronto vamos bien de menos a m s hemos sido intensos proponiendo lo que nos gusta como equipo y ahora en casa tenemos que ser m s eficaces
5349954 both legitimate with the irs does that mean id be considered spam or in violation of the forum rules
5349955 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5349956 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5349957 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5349958 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5349959 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5349960 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5349961 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5349962 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5349963 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5349964 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5349965 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5349966 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5349967 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5349968 the most stable unit in society right now is the family and that is based on a marriage between a man and a woman it has been that way for thousands and thousands of years its the best way to raise kids its that simple
5349969 this amendment would essentially enshrine discrimination into the constitution a perfect example of state sponsored discrimination
5349970 i always knew though not by official documents and information kept from me about the existence of an agreement based on dont harm me and i wont harm you between the italian republic and organizations such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the plo
5349971 was awarded an extraordinary capability for the direction of italian intelligence agencies and special forces after he received approval for the deal
5349972 according to the deal the palestinian organizations could establish bases in italy enjoyed freedom of movement when entering and exiting the country and could move around without undergoing mandatory security checks because they were protected by the secret service
5349973 during my time as interior minister i learned that plo people were holding heavy artillery in their homes and protected by diplomatic immunity as representatives of the arab league i was told not to worry and i managed to convince them to lay down their heavy artillery and make do with light weaponry
5349974 kim kardashian is a plus sized pussycat doll of the day

5349980 es una selecci n con jugadores de mucha calidad y que vienen de hacer bien las cosas con sus equipos es por eso que debemos salir a ganar y hacer lo que sabemos por que la nica palabra es que no debe haber pretextos para sacar un buen resultado
5349981 no podemos decir que honduras ser f cil cuenta con jugadores de renombre en su l nea ofensiva el ejemplo est con suazo quien juega en europa sin embargo nosotros tenemos las condiciones suficientes para anular su ataque es por eso que debemos aprovechar al m ximo este par de d as que tendremos de preparaci n para afinar los ltimos detalles y llegar en perfectas condiciones al partido

5349986 at the top of the fleet the points are really close so i have to watch my opponents and select my routes carefully
5349987 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5349988 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5349989 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5349990 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5349991 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5349992 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5349993 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5349994 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5349995 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5349996 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5349997 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5349998 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5349999 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
