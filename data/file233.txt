2330006 its up to the board there are a couple of options
2330007 the towns share is 78 percent and that on the surface does not seem appropriate
2330008 at least look at this again and see how it is proportioned
2330009 that type of operation is the first thing well start implementing september october november december
2330010 well probably be running trains out of victor once a month
2330011 in the future were talking two to three years even four passenger service which would be more a commuter style train from victor to geneva
2330012 we would love to be able to tie that all together
2330013 in the end its going to be great to bring people to victor
2330014 it was supposed to be the fastest passenger train in the united states at the time
2330015 well i never actually fought in the war any war for that matter but i did make a shallow parody movie where george patton kicks the shit out of a michael moore stand in in the name of patriotism and then i played the martyr about it when i know im in an industry where someone can and still have a steady directing career yes son i put my very soul on the line so that you too would have the chance to make jokes about how rosie odonnell is a crazy dyke
2330016 matt asay of cnet is suggesting something probably unpopular with the cupertino crowd tax it

2330019 the road is narrow and we have to straddle the white line to give room for other vehicles to pass on our left

2330032 there are not many gloucester players who have ever been granted a testimonial year so to follow players like andy deacon and mark cornwell with this honour means a huge amount to me
2330033 this is just something very special and to be only the third player to ever receive one is a tremendous honour
2330034 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2330035 we dont put things into our magazine without looking into them first

2330039 a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities
2330040 thought there was any chance of any charges being brought against victor reyes
2330041 quite frankly i dont know what he would have done wrong
2330042 i am not going to comment on anything about what were doing
2330043 we knew before this commission was even formed that there was a potential desire to have a two tier pension system for city employees
2330044 unions have consistently been against such a plan it establishes different benefits and creates different classes within your membership
2330045 very difficult to represent people an employee is an employee whether you have 20 years five years or no years
2330046 we have to look at where there may be possible savings for the city if labor can be helpful we want to address some of those savings
2330047 his crimes have imposed on hundreds if not thousands a life sentence of poverty
2330048 to impart some of what ive learned in pursuing a lifes passion of public service
2330049 for those of you who still dont know me very well ive been for the last 19 years the ceo of the city of chicago one of the most culturally rich economically diverse globally recognized cities on earth
2330050 with that as the foundation i will do my best
2330051 it was the most generic speech anybody could come up with
2330052 none of it was directed to us it was just about him selling himself the city the olympics he could have given that speech to anyone anywhere anytime and he probably has
2330053 he spent a lot of time talking about what he had done and all the things that made him great and not so much time talking to us
2330054 actually i came to this ceremony because he was here
2330055 dont let the cynics and skeptics discourage you you can make a difference in fact were counting on you
2330056 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
2330057 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2330058 pebble which has been around for a bit but still comes in nice shapes and colors
2330059 the district did things that were very difficult for me to handle
2330060 first week of school when i saw the kids come in and they came running into the building and they came running in to see the adults the adults were happy to see the kids it just crystallized for me how a building should look and how it should feel
2330061 made me understand again why i got in the business
2330062 were elated and very happy to have george on board as our new high school principal
2330063 they live and breathe and die northmont just like in kettering it intrigued me in that respect its an excellent district excellent people there
2330064 just sign these and dont even bother looking at them because they are stupid and dont mean anything
2330065 ils tiraient non pas depuis l paule mais avaient plac leurs armes au niveau du ventre et ont arros la salle de munitions
2330066 the democratic party would rather lose the election with obama than lose the black vote for 30 years because of convention shenannigans
2330067 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
2330068 the problem is there are limited number of possibilities that would work for us
2330069 we had a good meeting with rta mark donaghy and frank ecklar director of planning this past monday they are very receptive to prioritizing the glengarry drive issue and working on finding a permanent solution which addresses both their concerns and ours they will be contacting the school board and the greene among many other possibilities well continue to monitor their progress on a solution

2330074 it takes a pretty special game to carry such a lengthy title and be able to hold its head high amongst games with much shorter names
2330075 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package

2330087 sima urale and i went through every scene talking about where we could compromise location changes or where we could fit a scene into that day keeping actors out of whatever or putting them in just constant changes with the schedule to try to make it fit
2330088 with low budget films theres more of a chance theyll make less money if youve got bigger budget films you have bigger stars and audiences are attracted to them
2330089 sima got such great performances out of everyone the cast loved her they adore her
2330090 there was such great feeling on the shoot from everyone
2330091 we purposely didnt have a cast and crew screening so that everyone would come to the one at the film festival and everyone did so the crew had the opportunity to celebrate what they did
2330092 the positive multiculturalism in apron strings was a good opportunity to have a charity screening in south auckland for the people to recognise the positives in that community
2330093 its about how the audience responds to it and you cant second guess them everything is subjective and some people will love it and some wont its great to evoke strong emotion either way
2330094 one time i ate right before going on stage and i had to hide my belches from the microphone that was funny
2330095 i dont partner with anybody but this really was natural for me because ive been a fan from the beginning
2330096 i love their personality have you ever read the bottles dont you just feel naturally smarter when you read it
2330097 this could easily result in highly qualified applicants never receiving consideration
2330098 instances of non compliance this soon after the adoption of the plan are particularly disturbing and need to be addressed as quickly as possible
2330099 this could easily result in highly qualified applicants never receiving consideration due to the volume of applications
2330100 an architecture that results in a product that customers like to buy
2330101 an architecture that results in a product that works as advertised
2330102 show me the use cases and requirements that generated this architecture
2330103 what is the use case or requirement that led to this piece of the architecture
2330104 the products are working the way customers expect it to
2330105 there is a feeling in large companies that this is a little bit dangerous
2330106 but its also dangerous not to know whats going on
2330107 if youre going to get a lot of bad feedback on your blog then youre getting that anyway
2330108 it took about six months but they finally did it
2330109 thats what it seemed like to me one older kid picking on a little kid
2330110 did you hear that they shut down the main reactor well be destroyed for sure this is madness
2330111 we really do try to have something for everyone and pride ourselves on being a family friendly festival
2330112 we have games for teenagers as well as younger children and we have poker texas holdem and other activities for adults
2330113 weve added some new games and my rides people just told me theyll be bringing out some new rides
2330114 when digging in the yard we often find coal clinkers from the old ncr boilers that were used to fill in the hilly terrain before any kind of construction could begin
2330115 second quarter net income increased this year due to a lower provision for loan losses and higher non interest income compared with the second quarter of 2007
2330116 last year in the second quarter our net income was affected by a 5 5 million after tax loss associated with loan irregularities at our subsidiary acceptance loan company alc since that time we have made solid progress in cleaning up alcs loan portfolio
2330117 united security bancshares and first united security bank remain well capitalized
2330118 at the close of the second quarter our total risk based capital was 17 9 for the bank compared with regulatory requirements of 10 0 for a well capitalized bank and minimum regulatory requirements of 8 0 our strong capital base allowed us to increase our cash dividend in the second quarter and repurchase 43 070 shares of united security bancshares during the first six months of this year
2330119 our net loans were 398 7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2008 down from 427 6 million at year end 2007
2330120 loan demand is soft in some of our markets due to the slowdown in the economy and we remain focused on maintaining our credit quality as we extend new credit we are optimistic about increasing our level of loans as the economy improves
2330121 our total non performing assets increased 5 3 to 34 0 million in the second quarter compared with 32 3 million sequentially in the first quarter of this year
2330122 as a result we increased our provision for loan losses from the first quarter to reflect the continued slowdown in the economy and higher charge offs experienced in recent quarters we remain very aggressive in identifying problem loans in the portfolio to minimize future losses at the end of the second quarter our allowance for loan losses was 7 8 million or 1 9 of loans
2330123 he is thinking about going to rehab judges like to see it
2330124 the other car ran a red light and if not already they will be cited
2330125 i was fascinated by the psychic i wanted to know what it felt like when youre channelling or doing whatever it takes to get to that state of mind so he changed my perspective on it
2330126 i would love to be able to contact people on the other side
2330127 if i could speak to my grandmother tonight id be doing it so i do believe
2330128 mitch and amy are able to work really well together
2330129 although she often gets herself into trouble she is very honest very caring and very perceptive when it comes to dealing with other peoples problems
2330130 she is sick of all her problems being on everyone elses lips and really wants to focus on other people for a change
2330131 and she can help her dad pick some tracks while she is there
2330132 on monday i paid 3 50 for a pint now all of a sudden its 3 90 i was shocked i complained to staff
2330133 they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices
2330134 i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2330135 when brian realised how much he was paying he disputed it
2330136 he did say we have prices for regulars and prices for people who dont come here very often he dropped himself in it
2330137 it is not true at all that we fail to have tariffs on display and charge different prices
2330138 the price list is up on the bar now what has happened is some of the prices have changed
2330139 and it is not correct to say that regulars get drinks at better prices than tourists
2330140 i assume they were not calling to wish me a happy day or a happy friday morning
2330141 she was absolutely furious when daniel confronted her and they had a full blown argument they were screaming at each other and the next thing she headbutted him
2330142 other family members ran over to break it off and she stormed off it turned from a nice family affair into a brawl between joss and her brother no one could believe it
2330143 you would think as the kids godmother shed be on time
2330144 as she recited the order of service she failed to read what she had been given it showed a lack of respect
2330145 the priest had to remind her of her responsibilities as a godparent it was embarrassing to see her mumble the wrong words
2330146 a couple of relatives were not happy and told her so afterwards but joss said she wouldnt take abuse of a bunch of old biddies
2330147 keith and i are both appealing to the press and stuff just to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town

2330161 the conservative worldview the strict father model assumes that the world is dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be made good the strict father is the moral authority who supports and defends the family tells his wife what to do and teaches his kids right from wrong the only way to do that is through painful discipline physical punishment that by adulthood will become internal discipline the good people are the disciplined people once grown the self reliant disciplined children are on their own those children who remain dependent who were spoiled overly willful or recalcitrant should be forced to undergo further discipline or be cut free with no support to face the discipline of the outside world
2330162 so project this onto the nation and you see that to the right wing the good citizens are the disciplined ones those who have already become wealthy or at least self reliant and those who are on the way
2330163 the background for rockridge is that conservatives especially conservative think tanks have framed virtually every issue from their perspective
2330164 rockridges job is to reframe public debate to create balance from a progressive perspective
2330165 i stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way you see the world looks very differently from up here dont believe me come see for yourselves
2330166 the city has not done a thing to protect my property
2330167 they need a wall of some sort to keep the ground from eroding
2330168 erosion affecting private property such as fences lawns etc will be placed in this priority these are the responsibility of the property owners
2330169 ive got a 30 year mortgage on this place and in 30 years this is going to be halfway up to my house by then
2330170 they tax you on the amount of property you got they are taxing me on all of this property that i dont have
2330171 it may be looking different but that land is still there it doesnt move his property line
2330172 we want to make sure anything that he would put in would not hurt his neighbors property
2330173 fema has established certain areas that would be flooded in the event of a 100 year magnitude storm which would be caused by a rainstorm that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in a specific year
2330174 were not aware of anything that has been found in that creek that has been hazardous
2330175 shes a bit thick you know so lets make sure she isnt in a room next to someone with a broken leg or appendicitis lets put her next to a woman with congestive heart failure so she is forced to listen through the thin curtain and hear how it will rule her life
2330176 and while lotus might not be the sexiest collaboration software around it is used by millions upon millions of people worldwide ibms support of the iphone could really propel corporations to adopt or at least consider supporting the iphone in it environments
2330177 from time lord to antic prince david tennant is the best hamlet in years
2330178 gregory dorans fluent pacey modern dress revival of hamlet gives tennant the chance to show the world that he has the range to tackle the most demanding classical role of all and praise be he seizes it
2330179 and thought id stop by when your private secretary said you were free for the next hour or so i figured i could just wait here for you to get back
2330180 it was definitely my idea a few of my friends did lend a hand on certain parts of the effort
2330181 to give this to the mccain campaign so they can run it on television and the internet
2330182 we cant give it to the mccain campaign outright because if we did that would constitute a contribution in excess of the allowable limits so instead were going to sell it to the mccain campaign for a dollar
2330183 since nobodys done it before nobody knows one way or the other
2330184 lets go with that then and assume for the sake of analysis that you get that video or perhaps something based on the idea anyway on television and the internet wouldnt that cause the mccain campaign to run a very significant and perhaps fatal risk
2330185 paris hilton is not to put too fine a point on it obviously retarded okay shes filthy rich granted her name is a household word and admittedly if unfortunately shes a role model for millions of young women and girls but shes also clinically speaking an imbecile and whats more most reasonably intelligent people know that now just imagine for a moment if you will that senator john mccain gets into a spitting contest with paris hilton and because of this or that random twist of fate some bit of bum luck a momentary lapse or gaffe he manages to lose the fight do you seriously think thats going to do poor old john any good and then after youve thought about that please tell me what possible good it could do him to win a spitting contest with paris hilton i mean jesus christ if he won if he totally demolished her and exposed her for the pathetic specimen of humanity that she actually is that would do nothing more than convince a significant percentage of the electorate that john mccain is a mean old man who goes around humiliating the mentally challenged
2330186 where she calls john mccain the oldest celebrity in the world and super old and says he started drinking beer out of a bucket
2330187 and then said that because that wrinkly white haired guy had used her in a campaign ad that must mean shes running for president well then come on now doesnt that demonstrate conclusively that shes an idiot
2330188 everybody on planet earth plus the inhabitants of several nearby solar systems has seen that video
2330189 does what she says next the part about energy policy sound like what a retarded person would say
2330190 you mean the part where she suggests a hybrid energy policy that offers tax incentives for high mileage vehicles combined with limited off shore drilling with strict environmental oversight
2330191 that sounds exactly like the sort of national energy policy that a retarded person would suggest and its obviously written by somebody else and read off cue cards at that
2330192 but what about when she says ill see you at the debates expletive is that any way to address a united states senator to call him the b word
2330193 you cant be serious have you forgotten that mccain called his own wife the c word
2330194 its quite well documented and since its been sixteen years since he did that im rather surprised you didnt know
2330195 its a long day indeed that makes a man call his own wife a
2330196 would disagree they would say its absolutely the worst curse word in the english language
2330197 would say that a little synonym for the bearded clam is the worst swear word ever
2330198 i swear i had nothing to do with this and have no idea what question this gentleman is talking about
2330199 i know you would never behave like this but i dont mind its been really quiet lately you know and kind of slow and now that its august kind of silly just like every other year ive been in washington so
2330200 do you think expletive is the absolute worst word in the english language
2330201 expletive is a cute little word i call my girlfriend lovers that
2330202 im bisexual and i call my boyfriend lovers expletive i dont think they mind that
2330203 theres something i have been meaning to ask you mr collins
2330204 i was googling around a couple of months ago and i ran across your blog
2330205 tom collins world wide web log i believe its called
2330206 thats me which is to say i am the author what about it
2330207 that you mention me but you never use my name its always my private secretary this and my private secretary that
2330208 i didnt want to take liberties with my private secretarys uh privacy
2330209 but you use your brothers name and his wifes and his sons and your sisters name and her husbands
2330210 if youre going to post on the web about me mr collins then from now on i want you to use my name
2330211 shes young urban professional and what do you liberals call it post modern just exactly the demographic johns going to need in order to win and she doesnt think expletive is a dirty word
2330212 at the end of her video paris hilton says shes hot so speaking as someone who can appreciate that from ah both sides of the question tell me do you think paris hilton is hot
2330213 that you wouldnt have sex with her even though shes a celebrity
2330214 i guess that means you wouldnt want to be a celebrity if thats so why not
2330215 because celebrities have names like britney spears and miley cyrus nobody named gretchen isabell ziegeschaefer could ever be one and im gretchen isabell ziegeschaefer so expletive it
2330216 most celebrities live miserable lives you know always being stalked by photographers not to mention deranged admirers living in a fish bowl all the time everybody second guessing them when they take their pet or child out in public some of them even end up being used as objects of ridicule in political campaign advertisements
2330217 and as i said what about that part at the end where paris says shes hot would you say that youre hot
2330218 and i want mr collins to put in his next blog post that im going to be hanging out at the 9 30 club starting on friday august 8th through sunday august 10th and then at chief ikes mambo room from tuesday august 12th through sunday august 17th and i want to meet some expletive and some expletive who want to expletive me
2330219 how in the world did a nice blonde blue eyed and i must say hot young lady like you become such a rapacious libertine
2330220 my parents are amish theres nothing like having something significantly repressive to rebel against you know
2330221 wolfmother toured the world virtually non stop through 2006 and early 2007 on the back of their acclaimed self titled debut album
2330222 longstanding frictions within the group then led them to take an extended break during the second half of 2007 to consider their future

2330262 we have had a lot of interest in our unique hot and cold beverage vending machines there seems to be a strong appetite for new and novel approaches within the vending machine sector with that in mind we are in discussions with a spanish based manufacturer in the snack sector that handles unique packaging formats we have a relationship with the manufacturer that spans decades while they have had great success with the concept in europe it has yet to be introduced into the north american market the management projects conservatively a 50 acceptance rate of the product in north america compared to europe we can safely say that even with that conservative acceptance rate this should translate into several million dollars in sales for the division over the course of the year we believe the machine would complement our hot and cold vending machine using essentially the same distribution channels these are high profile branded products that should complement our product line well

2330275 we are seeing more momentum behind blu ray as hdtv penetration continues to grow
2330276 it should be a strong holiday for the format theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output

2330284 the door facing yamaguchi opened and five boys fifteen or sixteen years old came running out they were unclothed except for torn underpants and yamaguchi saw that theywere covered in blood
2330285 i had never seen such a horrifying sight as those five shivering boys blood was pouring in streams from deep cuts all over their bodies mingling with their perspiration and their skin was burned deep red like the color of cokked lobsters at first it seemed strangely that their burned and lacerated backs and chests were growing green grass then i saw that hundreds of blades of sharp grass had been driven deep into their flesh evidently by the force of the blast
2330286 there was not a house standing as far as i could see although i knew the city well it was actually difficult to find my way for al the familiar landmarks were gone and the streets i often walked were now buried in debris and ashes

2330339 no one is safe today from the negative impact of poor application performance whether youre a gamer a retail outlet or a salesforce com user
2330340 the question is how much money do you have to lose if the application starts crawling along at traffic jam speeds
2330341 in the past we were managing the infrastructure which really doesnt get into how the application is performing for the end users
2330342 we need to be able to be aware of and see all of the pieces that make up an application and how they affect the end user to understand when performance is going to be impacted he says
2330343 we have had instances in which a performance problem would occur because something had been put on the network such as a network interface card or a port that causes a problem with an application such as voice

2330393 give up on your idea of the kingdom and how it will be established and trust me that the kingdom is now being established through following me
2330394 give up on all that forget your ideas of how this is going to be done and trust follow jesus and he will make you
2330395 i took a sabbatical from teaching this is my project its my attempt to bridge the gap from game community to a new form of game scholarship initially my real purpose was to demonstrate at wabash that you can be serious about games the blog started and it became clear to me that this is something that could be integrated into the liberal arts it was a lightbulb moment
2330396 it all started as conversation but now part of my mission with brainy gamer is to convince people that games can and should be a part of a curriculum its difficult we have people who are saying just let me play games and have fun but there are also those who have never played games and who are saying how can we let this in the academy i think both groups are resistant but for totally different reasons
2330397 what would it take to grow these kinds of communities
2330398 one thing id like to see is for developers to join these conversations with us steve gaynor is one good example and his blog is terrific manveer heir at design rampage is another developer who blogs about design and communicates with the wider community developers could add a dimension we often dont see
2330399 part of what game criticism is doing is that theres a kind of teaching mission were presuming we have something interesting to say to help people understand and appreciate games better potentially that appreciation will enable the group to grow
2330400 i think its a bigger space than we may think the community developed i think largely due to college and grad students there are a surprisingly large number of people who write thoughtful essays and comments on my blog enough people are interested to make it a critical mass
2330401 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2330402 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2330403 a very typical example how did i meet mirch krpata well someone linked me to something which linked to him somewhere i contacted him and he kindly responded thats pretty much how it works
2330404 even or especially outside of academia people are on unsure footing leighs the only one who dared to suggest a term for the most part people seem to be quiet about it
2330405 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there game studies is taking a fairly traditional academic approach to research and scholarship and as a professor who has done my share of papers and conferences im trying to go another way i want to write about games at the place where they are being discussed most vigorously online and amongst gamers i greatly respect what game studies is doing and ive benefited from this work but ive reached the point in my career where im not terribly interested in traditional academic research anymore
2330406 schools are nervous about games becoming academic without rigor or structured pedagogy im concerned about it too frankly i dont want it to be just discussions and nothing else
2330407 between having both the common gamer and academics strongly disapproving of the way you and the rest of us talk it sounds like you have quite the fight on your hands
2330408 its not a fight its making a case what is the place of conversation about video games in the liberal arts is it possible to teach the odyssey and the metal gear series in the same class can you leverage students interest in games to get them to think critically write persuasively and discuss intelligently all of which are goals of a liberal arts education i obviously think the answer is yes
2330409 theres great competition all over the place from making the roster to the practice squad kiffin said
2330410 so its going to be real exciting to see these guys play
2330411 weve got some guys who can run its a far better unit than it was a year ago as far as the depth and competition to make the roster
2330412 how we play in these games is going to carry a lot of weight
2330413 the rest of them are going to have to play special teams to show they can make the team

2330431 i wasnt trying to do anything vicious but it ended up being a nice little hit
2330432 if you think i am a bitch wait till you meet my mother
2330433 there were giants in those days and men of renown
2330434 even when he was little hed jump off the deck and slide down to the frog pond and onto the stream nearby
2330435 hes a really gifted rider especially on descents he has a unique understanding of how fast he can go downhill without riding too fast and crashing very often
2330436 hes also really strong hes not a huge guy but he breaks drivetrain components that nobody else breaks
2330437 this is the first year ive ridden in the elite group from the start at a few of the world cup races
2330438 before this year my good races have always been come from behind efforts to be riding at the front in races now shows me that if im strong and fit and fresh as i usually am somehow at the end of august i should be right there
2330439 when he first rode down cadillac mountain by himself at age 10 that was scary to me
2330440 adam rode down and his father harvey rode down but i stayed at the top i waited to drive down because i didnt want to pass them plus if i had driven down and seen them racing i knew id freak out
2330441 its like were at the olympic training center thats probably because they think maybe ill go to the olympics someday
2330442 at that point i was realistic but i also knew that i was racing pretty well and even then i could see that id have my best races at some of the bigger events like the junior world championships in 98 or 99 i raced up beyond my age level and i thought maybe it would work out someday
2330443 when i graduated high school and moved out to colorado springs to the olympic training center i think that was the turning point of thinking that i was going to do this full time and see if i can make a go of it
2330444 there were a couple of years of still working with harvey in the winter pounding nails or whatever and going to school before it panned out but going to school and not training at all that spring and kayaking a bunch somehow made me really fast
2330445 that year i considered myself a good choice for the team but i knew in the public eye i was a long shot
2330446 to not make it was a bummer but it wasnt that big a deal i also stood on a world cup podium that fall so i wasnt that bothered
2330447 getting that world cup podium in livigno right after the olympics i knew that would keep him motivated
2330448 he seems to spread himself really thin and that was something i was concerned with
2330449 but he just showed over and over that he could do it
2330450 this has been my goal for the last four years
2330451 i pretty much knew this was the situation for the last month or so but im glad that its come to fruition
2330452 i was kind of nervous all week knowing i was a little tired and still hoping i could pull it out
2330453 theyve extended the course to 6 kilometers and attempted to make it more technical with more jumps more rock sections and more twisty turny stuff so hopefully it will be more of a test of our mountain biking skills
2330454 but the course is really kind of irrelevant because everyones going to be fit and fast and races are won on the uphills and theres a whole bunch of them out there
2330455 its a notch higher for sure just like in every sport
2330456 for athletes personally we face the same challenge in the world championships once a year but we all acknowledge that the public eye is focused on summer sport once every four years and thats at the olympic games everyone acknowledges thats where you need to be and where you have to have your 200 percent game face on and not just your 110 percent
2330457 the olympic race is a little more distilled so theres not as much weird stuff happening as there is when you have 270 starters at a european world cup
2330458 at the olympics there are only 30 or 40 in the race so youre not going to get stuck behind a crowd at the start
2330459 im still trying to stay away from that actual goals thing
2330460 i feel like if im having the kind of day im pretty sure i can have i should be in contention for a medal it would be nice to get one of those
2330461 my moms already looked up what they look like on the internet she says they look real nice
2330462 i saw this neat movie a while back maybe it was in the 60s or maybe i just read it in a book but in it some guy is a killer and he pokes these girls eyes out
2330463 well my good friend that would be peeping tom the wonderfully gruesome movie directed by the great brit michael powell who greatly influenced our own martin scorsese
2330464 dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb
2330465 i always go to these bluegrass festivals and i thought i wanted to bring it on home and have it here at the farm
2330466 its something i always wanted to do and i finally got the notion to go ahead with it five years ago
2330467 the groups from the first year were good and if they helped me get this off the ground im not going to shut them off
2330468 theyve always got a job here at this festival if ive got to do more days ill do it if people help me ill help them back
2330469 that topped it off but the whole crowd is good im really looking forward to the festival weve been going nonstop getting this place together but were ready so bring em all in come on down weve got room for everybody

2330477 isnt it true that most people in sex work have been sexually abused
2330478 well i chose teaching because i wanted to spend more time with my children one event having children determined career choice
2330479 and i really love the way childrens eyes light up when they get a concept and i really want to make a difference in the world plus i had a great teacher in the 3rd grade who really challenged me and changed my life
2330480 i had a really terrible teacher in the 3rd grade who left me feeling degraded and humiliated i thought i could do better than her
2330481 oh im doing this because of my 3rd grade teacher whether a good experience or bad
2330482 isnt it true that most people in sex work have been sexually abused
2330483 theres a supposition in that statement that one distinct event affects our life decisions that statement is at best a narrow way of looking at our life choices
2330484 we the council members are right the people have no say so
2330485 because god doesnt need any help he doesnt have a mom he can do whatever he wants
2330486 no one made god he is eternal he has always been and will always be

2330488 ive flown out of character so many times in that sense ive been lucky because ive been given the liberty to do just about anything ive wanted to do in my lifetime
2330489 we are pleased to be introducing this new initiative to our customers in the initial stage we will only introduce the project to ten of our sites
2330490 imagine the disaster that such motorists can bring when they are allowed to put fuel in cars i did reprimand one of them but was bluntly asked to mind my own business self service is quite good as it will not only save time but make people more responsible having said that i think an awareness campaign of dos and donts need to be launched before the concept of self service is fully implemented
2330491 i am an arab and i am sure women from this part of the region will make a big fuss about the entire thing the majority would prefer the attendant to fill their fuel tank
2330492 well you have to invite these people and you cant cut these people and you absolutely will not cut these people
2330493 so thats it i dont have any money so i cant bring anyone to your wedding if they have so much money why dont they pay for the whole thing

2330500 its great to see all this talent thats just one guitar and one voice with all this writing
2330501 when we did the showcase last year i didnt realize it would be such a big success but i was happy about it this year the artists pretty much called me and said hey are you doing that showcase again i figured they mustve had fun so i decided to try it again
2330502 its very hard deciding on a lineup for these showcases because it has to be artists chelley and i really admire and respect
2330503 we have so many good friends in the business its really hard to pick these girls out but im excited about this years lineup it gives dayton something really nice to come out and enjoy times are tough the economy is rough and you get all this music for 10 bucks i mean come on
2330504 tori is a very good friend of mine and she travels all the time all around the country playing
2330505 she called and said she was going to be in town in august and wondered if we had a show so she could come sit it we only get to play with her maybe once a year and shes just become a really good friend and a great person to know in music so we decided to do the showcase then
2330506 not only are these girls my friends they do this for the door and when they travel around they make pretty good money for their shows
2330507 they come here pretty much because theyre friends of frozen feet which chelley and i really embrace the girls stay with us at our houses when they come from out of town we break bread together and talk about life in the meantime we perform and try to sell our music so the world hears what we do i think thats pretty special
2330508 what we grieve for is not the loss of a grand vision but rather the loss of common things events and gestures ordinariness is the most precious thing we struggle for what the jews of the warsaw ghetto fought for not noble causes or abstract theories but the right to go on living with a sense of purpose and a sense of self worth an ordinary life
2330509 chris and i did a process i call life triage on sunday morning over the breakfast table im not sure if he even realized thats what we were doing life triage is taking an honest look at your life figuring out where you are and where you want to be actually getting down some goals and figuring out several tangible steps towards each of those goals life triage is all about figuring out whats worth working on whats already dead and what you cant do anything for at the moment
2330510 you never know whose words are going to inspire somebody to make a change in their life
2330511 well ill try to get a picture of one and just as i get ready to photograph it another hummer will dart up start a fight with it and chase it off
2330512 i want to enjoy the hummingbirds but because they cant get along it just completely ruins it for me and makes me angry at them it would be so much easier if they didnt fight all the time
2330513 so wait i think i know what youre saying when you and your brother fight i feel exactly the same way oh my gosh now you know how i feel
2330514 tell dad i need to pay for the ski trip he needs to bring 85 each for christian and me when he picks me up

2330520 mama after i wake up i want to wake you up and then for the whole day i want to follow you every where you go
2330521 the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace
2330522 once again i come to address all people and all nations i am calling all people to a conversion of heart through these messages of holy and divine love and through these chambers of our united hearts this is your opportunity each one of you to save your soul and to bring about change in the world heaven would be remiss in not offering to you such a plan such a profound path of light in the midst of such chaos and wickedness yet as i attempt to pull earth back onto the path of righteousness evil continues to make inroads into the most unlikely realms of everyday life satans presence goes unnoticed for moral standards have become so compromised
2330523 satans number one priority is to be unnoticed he convinces people that he doesnt exist or he clothes his hidden agendas in false goodness he promotes lustful ambition in hearts along with the allurement of control power and money many of my best efforts have been thwarted in the world for satan has caused a swirl of controversy to cloud the truth the apparitions at this site have been one of satans main targets he does not want souls to discover the truth and the power of this spirituality but i will not allow the lion of evil to do anything but roar he has been rendered toothless by my hand the divine will shall be victorious
2330524 before this victory comes the battle which mankind finds himself in today he is confusing sin with rights even legalizing sins such as abortion and euthanasia do not think that because you make it legal that it is not still a sin in my eyes do not have misplaced compassion believing you must not condemn same gender marriages i am not tolerant of such sin in order to save feelings
2330525 today i reveal to you some of satans greatest and most powerful weapons weapons that he uses within the church to destroy the true tradition of faith
2330526 when his prot g s have been placed in high positions they then unleash their intellectual patterns and plans which oppose tradition and the magisterium itself
2330527 another favorite weapon of satans is the cry for a more prominent role for women he whips them into a frenzy of rebellion against church tradition some even turn to witchcraft in an erroneous attempt to gain power this is in truth their undoing as they have then become puppets of evil
2330528 some may find these revelations i give you today hard to believe even shocking but i only reveal the truth for when the light of truth overtakes darkness darkness loses its power notice that these weapons of satans favor intellectual pride and the desire for greater importance within the church come clothed in seeming goodness they are however full of self interest self love
2330529 stay on the path of light by always serving others and not looking for your own gain or profit in any way realize that the source of all good comes from god no one creates their own intellect or their calling within the church itself be humble and satisfied with even the lowliest of positions do not seek to be important in mans eyes only seek to appeal to me
2330530 beyond all of these underlying tactics of satan he has one more which is pulling apart whole pieces of my church like the elimination of chess pieces from a game board here i am speaking specifically of the masons yes many of my dearest instruments have fallen victim to their hidden agenda of lies and satanic actions a bishop here a knight there all like pieces on a chessboard at first in positions of cardinal importance only to become pawns of satan i grieve for them let the wise man grasp my meaning
2330531 my mother has requested that i reveal all of these truths to you today on the anniversary of her birth i have honored her request i ask that as a special gift to her you pray that these evils be overcome pray that the church on earth be strengthened through prayer and sacrifice the remnant faithful who have not forsaken the tradition of faith must make many sacrifices many holy hours of reparation and pray many rosaries for the welfare of the church my mother awaits patiently these prayers and sacrifices these gifts from your heart to hers
2330532 so my brothers and sisters i am taking your prayers into my divine heart i realize that some come here only out of curiosity others to find fault but there are some who come here with great faith believing and hoping my brothers and sisters i call you back into the present moment to find your conversion your salvation through holy love pray as my mother has requested for the conversion of sinners and the conversion of the heart of the church she longs that the remnant faithful increase and strengthen
2330533 today i am blessing you with my blessing of divine love
2330534 mais alors vous ferez quoi pendant la c r monie
2330535 oh vous savez jai 250 gigas de films sur mon pc alors
2330536 our whole philosophy on defense is to get the best 11 on the field
2330537 confidence that if something gets by hes gonna be there
2330538 weve known him since he was knee high to a gopher
2330539 terms that you heard back then when you hear them now they just pop back into your head
2330540 hes been around those kind of people all his life
2330541 a lot of people dont have that opportunity to have someone who knows the game around them all the time
2330542 right now if i have to ill put him at quarterback
2330543 pressures just what you put on yourself if you just go out there do it its not a big deal
2330544 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2330545 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2330546 waiting in the wings with a level pack or dlc or anything
2330547 the passage of federal legislation two years ago mandating schools to adopt wellness policies a response by congress to the alarming surge in childhood obesity will be looked back upon as the launching pad for the school wellness movement
2330548 that legislation has gotten the ball rolling by identifying schools as playing a key role in the development of childrens eating and exercising habits
2330549 the goal of the program was to update milks image to make it more appealing to kids so that theyd drink more and get the essential nutrients they need
2330550 we got rid of the old fashioned hard to open paperboard cartons and put milk in contemporary plastic resealable containers
2330551 we worked with milk processors to formulate additional low fat milk flavors like strawberry vanilla and orange and are seeing increases in milk consumption up to 30 percent in schools that offer the new milk
2330552 im a milk drinker myself and i was bothered by the statistics that showed so many young people were abandoning milk at such an early age
2330553 weve had nothing but positive feedback from parents teachers and students
2330554 students love the updated look and more flavor varieties vanilla is the favorite
2330555 this is very positive news for the health of our students while across the country weve seen milk consumption among teens dip here in pennsylvania weve actually found a way to get kids to drink more
2330556 schools have control over what is served in the cafeteria but more schools are beginning to regulate what kids bring in from home
2330557 many kids just do not arrive at school early enough to eat breakfast in the cafeteria and many do not eat at home
2330558 hungry is no way to start a successful school day
2330559 another alternative method of marketing healthy foods and beverages to students is through ala carte sales and vending
2330560 our robust operations coupled with the recent close of our 340 million five year revolving credit facility with jp morgan and our strong balance sheet positions us to continue growing our business despite the current difficult market environment
2330561 as a result we expect to continue our double digit revenue growth this year with a view toward generating significant positive ebitda and continued double digit revenue growth in fiscal 2010
2330562 its not how i was raised he said after a morning workout
2330563 i come from a hard working family my mother my father they worked thats pretty much all i know it carries into the way i play and the way i carry myself i got it watching them whatever i get i work for
2330564 it aint about feeling appreciated its about me doing my job and them doing their part at the end of the day if it aint working out it aint working out
2330565 the simple joys of childhood such as bike riding climbing trees and even just crossing the road are basic skills that are in danger of being entirely lost
2330566 wherever a usable path for bicycles has been provided adjacent to a roadway bicycle riders shall use such path and shall not use the roadway
2330567 it is essential that the safety of citizens and protection of their property is fully guaranteed because public order is a prerequisite
2330568 what does the current rage skin bleaching tell us about our identity
2330569 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
2330570 key to ending child slavery in haiti is creating long term economic options for parents and access to quality education for children
2330571 according to the radio news the death of my friend bloneva bethel was the result of a domestic dispute
2330572 i asked alice if she could help find vocalists and i have got actors
2330573 there will be instrumentalists past students from roncalli and drama throughout the evening
2330574 i got the idea from the old tavern shows we used to have
2330575 we have the same problems as the rest of the country but because of our smaller area the percentage of our issues are concentrated
2330576 the luxury of having a full time position is we can have a more holistic and educational view towards alcohol offending
2330577 i would hope we have the ability to educate more people and have a greater understanding of why offending happens
2330578 there is an area that is not safe for firefighters so we wont put a line down on it
2330579 on behalf of the board and senior management team we are grateful to rick for his important contributions to the companys growth and development and wish him success in his future endeavors
2330580 it has been a great pleasure helping to grow unfi and i have enjoyed a wonderful relationship with the many great people who have contributed to our success i wish continued success to all of the many friends i have at the company
2330581 were pretty much resigned to the fact that were going to make rage fit onto two dvds on the 360
2330582 selling third party games and they are doing very well and better than nintendos competitors
2330583 ive probably know who tom waits is longer than you
2330584 almost every day back when he was a candidate for potus but its been a while since then and i googled him up again recently i wasnt sure what id find but was pretty shocked
2330585 dont ask a dying man to swear his soul into hell
2330586 why dont you take a good rest i must say youve earned it this is friday dont come in till monday
2330587 we want to make it easy for 18 to 24 year olds across the rangitata and waitaki electorates to enrol to vote
2330588 the fear that evans st people had was that they transit were going to go to that meeting with an evans st or bust scenario
2330589 theyre now going to that meeting with a strategy for the next 30 years and favouring more a rail bypass than the evans st option
2330590 transit has listened to us and have listened to the reasons that the evans st people have put forward to them and now know the views of the community which they did not have six months ago
2330591 om een ridder te worden moet je gaan handelen als een ridder
2330592 alle genetische componenten van een muis zijn precies hetzelfde als die van een mens
2330593 als zoog dieren delen mensen veel psychologische en anatomische overeenkomsten en ook op het gebied van de stofwisseling zijn er veel gelijkenissen

2330598 this improvement reflects the significant progress we have made in streamlining both our fixed and variable cost structures in addition notable orders in the quarter included multimillion dollar outsourced transcription expansions at two leading academic medical center customers and the return of a large midwestern academic medical center customer who had left us in 2004
2330599 we are very pleased to have cbay systems holdings limited as a new investor and we look forward to exploring mutual synergies with the cbay systems holdings limited group in the future
2330600 the reduction in profitability in the first half of the year was driven primarily by higher commodity costs versus the comparable period in 2007 commodity prices started to increase towards the end of the second quarter of 2007 and therefore we do not expect to see a corresponding negative impact on a year over year basis from commodity costs in the second half of 2008 furthermore in recent weeks we have begun to see a decline in overall commodity costs which if maintained would favorably affect our year over year comparisons we also expect to benefit from same store sales comparisons as our same store sales decreased 1 8 in the fourth quarter of 2007 year to date we have reported flat same store sales as compared to a 3 increase in the first half of 2007
2330601 our primary business objective is to produce excellent long term investment returns for our clients the first six months of 2008 was a difficult market environment and for the most part each of our strategies performed very well on a relative basis however our focus is on long term results and i am pleased that all our strategies continued to outperform their benchmarks over the past five years
2330602 new client investments in the first half of 2008 were 1 4 billion which is an increase of 96 compared to the first half of 2007 we have also seen an increase in our institutional separate account business including our large cap strategy being selected for the managed account programs from two different investment firms
2330603 every time i pick up a new game im like oh my god theyve changed the controller mappings again and now ive got to you know reconfigure my head just so i can start to enjoy this game
2330604 another strong example of the serious ramifications that can come from letting impressionable teens play violent video games like this one
2330605 if you look at the whole population youth violent crime has gone down dramatically since the 1990s while playing computer games has gone up exponentially
2330606 it may be that a kid attracted to criminal behavior is also attracted to violent games
2330607 you cant make the simple statement that if you expose a kid to violent games then hell become violent
2330608 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2330609 hey teacher im cute as heck and you better know it
2330610 i am a non muslim making a film on a muslim protagonist
2330611 satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire so long as it hurts no one else
2330612 its going to be hard im going to miss all that hot wild sex but ill just have to give it up become a gentile live a life of strict chastity because those stories in the torah dont make a lot of sense
2330613 he would be doing us all a huge mitzvah if he accepted such a position
2330614 a definite you have it to say the muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order what sort of suffering not letting them travel deportation further down the road curtailing of freedoms
2330615 all men are not my brothers why because all women are my sisters and the brother who denies the rights of his sister that brother is not my brother
2330616 by serious commentators that suicide mass murderers are searching for the simplest means of getting a girlfriend
2330617 rational response to suicide mass murder would be something like an unvarying factory siren of unanimous disgust but we havent managed that what we have managed on the whole is a murmur of dissonant evasion
2330618 imagining what it is like to be someone other than yourself is at the core of our humanity it is the essence of compassion and it is the beginning of morality
2330619 to inspire in most readers the kind of devotion that the defense of our liberties requires
2330620 perfect terror and perfect boredom and of nothing else a world with no games no arts and no women a world where the sole entertainment is the public execution
2330621 a total system and like all such systems eerily amenable to satire but with islamism with total malignancy with total terror and total boredom irony even militant irony which is what satire is merely shrivels and dies
2330622 churchill hitler and the unnecessary war how britain lost its empire and the west lost the world
2330623 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization

2330625 never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you
2330626 i responded not sure exactly what i said but it further enraged him and he swerved into me
2330627 his door bumped my knee and his mirror was right in front of me so i pushed down and away from it and it broke off
2330628 he continued to push me off the road and i started to go down as my bike began to go under the wheel
2330629 as it started getting lower and lower and closer i turned around i didnt see anything because theres a hill behind me

2330666 while this plan gives consumers another choice in how to manage their electricity bills in the short run it does not take away from the fact that before you know it pennsylvanias families and businesses will be paying substantially more for electricity
2330667 energy prices are going up but the longer we wait to act the more difficult its going to be to give consumers real relief
2330668 it is imperative that we pass legislation this fall to mitigate these rate increases and give ratepayers more options to lower their energy consumption by using electricity more efficiently the measures the legislature passed and i signed last month are a good first step but we must move to correct the shortcomings of deregulation and electricity policy in pennsylvania otherwise families are going to lose their homes and businesses will shut their doors because they cant pay their electricity bill

2330695 hes the most riveting orator in the world but does good public speaking mean youre ready to lead adolph hitler thought so and millions were murdered in a monstrous holocaust can we really afford to take a chance on history repeating itself
2330696 hes an elite ivy league educated intellectual but are his big ideas right for america barack obama says no to offshore drilling no to u s victory abroad and yes to taxes sound familiar sounds like the big ideas of the brutal communist dictator vladimir lenin thats the real obama
2330697 hes charming hes charismatic hes cool or so he seems charles manson seemed charismatic too an american original just like barak obama but john mccain knows theres nothing cool about ritualistic cult murder john mccain knows we dont need charlie manson in the oval office
2330698 avoiding military service barack obama never spent time on a battlefield or a pow camp he preferred instead the safety of a warm gym to develope his lithe athletic body much as a gay male bodybuilder might does america really want a gay bodybuilder in the white house john mccain voted to put homosexual rapists and murderers behind bars for life
2330699 in our great land anyone can succeed regardless of race creed or color but does the virulent anti semitic hate speech of a louis farrakhan really have a place in american politics john mccain says no no to race war no to violence and mob rule no to barak obamas vision for america
2330700 barack obama calls for global unity tolerance and international law the very same things that the antichrist advocates oh the antichrist will ride in from babylon on a horse of death singing a song of unity as the world falls to bloody apocalypse read your bible america thats the real obama
2330701 john mccain likes ice cream when asked his opinion on ice cream barack obama stated that he doesnt like ice cream

2330719 are you sure you were an alcoholic youre a jew
2330720 thats when i realized if i keep doing what im doing im going to come home to no one
2330721 i was looking for something more than what the 12 steps are about
2330722 the greatest thing about the whole thing is i have a place to go
2330723 i have my own relationship with what i was searching for i was hiding in my addiction and it makes recovery so much easier for me now that i have that connection
2330724 about a year ago one of our members asked if we could host aa meetings at the temple
2330725 i thought and our staff and lay leadership agreed that this would be a very important step for us to take there are jewish alcoholics there are jews who are substance abusers having aa at jeremiah makes it a kosher program as well too many people think that aa is a christian program this is not true as a result of our hosting aa meetings more and more people have come up to me to both thank me and acknowledge their status in recovery
2330726 the experience validated all that we have done as a congregation and provided motivation for us to continue to work to help in the recovery process as a congregation as jews as human beings
2330727 from that point on matt was on a new course
2330728 it hurts but your leg heals i traveled to europe for two weeks with buddies i took my leg off in the middle of a huge parade in germany and waved it around hundreds of onlookers i graduated from college at michigan state university in five years three of them involving surgeries and chemo i walked across the stage i lived in spain for a study abroad program in law school i used an old pizza box as padding for my leg because i danced literally all night in san sebastian i traveled to israel i met the most beautiful women in the world there and got shot down by all of them i also climbed a mountain overlooking jordan and syria i rode a camel i graduated law school i stood as best man to watch my brother marry his beautiful bride i got to hold my new baby niece ella and kiss her chubby face when she was born so yes its also pretty freaking cool
2330729 theyre not going to tell him he cant climb a mountain no ones going tell him he cant graduate law school

2330735 do you think were ever going to get gilad shalit back
2330736 we may get him back and we may not how can you possibly say that we definitely will
2330737 why did i say that because when he hears the news each and every day the only thing that your brother thinks about is the fact that youre about to get drafted and hes beyond worried hes panicked because he worships the ground you walk on and he needs to believe to know he needs to believe that youre going to be ok and he wants to know that though he lives in a country that asks its kids to do everything to commit everything that country also knows that it owes them everything in return and getting them home no matter what has happened to them is part of that

2330757 we are pleased to see that the members of the committee understand that many californians are already struggling to make ends meet in our current economy
2330758 there are better ways to protect the environment and reduce litter without punishing consumers including further expansion of efforts to recycle reduce and reuse plastic bags some programs are already underway including one created by ab 2449 a law that went into effect last year and mandates plastic bag recycling at larger grocery stores and certain retailers throughout the state
2330759 we will certainly continue our role in encouraging consumers to use californias state wide recycling program and increase the recycling of plastic bags
2330760 plastics are a valuable resource too valuable to waste and we believe effective implementation of the states recycling program is the best and fastest way to steward environmental resources and reduce litter by recycling these bags

2330797 it gives a multi point of view of what it is to be hawaiian
2330798 what we as hawaiians should be doing were not going to forget about our culture and what not we have to keep moving forward stick together and work together if we going to separate then things are just going to fall apart
2330799 you have to see it its very emotional and spiritual and for people who are hawaiian even if theyre not hawaiian people are really moved by this story

2330836 an internet phenomenon sometimes called an internet meme occurs when something relatively unknown becomes increasingly popular often quite suddenly through the mass propagation of media content made feasible by the internet however the popularity of the phenomenon usually wanes as rapidly as it was acquired the internets lack of physical boundaries leads to a much faster and wider spread of information and ideas especially when the subject is based around humor or curiosity

2330847 while dmap permits may be used only on the specific property for which they are issued they do offer hunters additional antlerless deer hunting opportunities on large tracts of public lands in wmu 2g which has exhausted its antlerless deer license allocation
2330848 dmap was developed to provide a way for hunters to help landowners achieve the type of deer harvest they require to better manage their lands we encourage hunters to contact these landowners and take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity

2330851 smart money will go for the gold to gain safety today and growth tomorrow
2330852 volatile stock markets and a lack of confidence in the banking system has boosted demand for gold coins from private investors to levels not seen for 25 years
2330853 upcoming government bailouts will boost the money supply and further shred whats left of the dollars buying power
2330854 every year the july to september period has marked the bottom for the year and as the years have passed the moves up after that period have increased exponentially
2330855 with prices dipping now is the time to buy gold coins the next up move will send gold prices above 1 175 in 2008
2330856 sat in my car looked at the disc and then listened to it song by song making sure there is nothing hidden in it
2330857 i felt that because at the beginning i was honest with them that i told fitness first my medical condition they should have warned me before telling me to sign the contract straight away
2330858 so i felt that i shouldnt pay the 200 and im on a disability pension the money to me is very important
2330859 ms chong was bound by the conditions of the contracts
2330860 i dont want to remember anything more about fitness first its very very stressful for the whole year
2330861 the government today promised to set up a new panel with more powers to look into medical environmental and economic support
2330862 i was 28 years old then our fight has been going on for 24 years and we will keep up the pressure on the government
2330863 we expect the government to go hammer and tongs after dow chemical now that the law ministry has indicated that union carbides civil liabilities can be passed on to dow
2330864 we have won our demands only after facing undue harassment at the hands of the government and delhi police
2330865 we found a state of the art plant workers receiving fair wage and benefits such as health dental and vacation pay great attention to worker safety and the use of the e verification system to ensure all workers are legal
2330866 investigations have produced a long list of allegations against the company including that it employed underage workers that insufficient safety training led to workers being injured and maimed and that workers were underpaid
2330867 in the eyes of the companys critics and even some orthodox rabbis the fact that agriprocessors paid for the trip rendered the rabbis conclusions suspect neither of the national councils two news releases regarding the trip disclosed that agriprocessors had footed the bill for the rabbis
2330868 if theyre going and being paid by rubashkin plants owner then that should be forthrightly disclosed
2330869 its very important if rabbis are going that things look totally above board and that its 100 percent clear that the desire is to do the right thing and not just the expedient thing
2330870 some in the orthodox community are calling for a more rigorous investigation
2330871 we need a commission with incredible stature and with rabbis of great merit who can spend a few weeks or a month in postville and can make recommendations
2330872 unfortunately the responses of the leading orthodox organizations the rabbinical council of america and the orthodox union have in my opinion fallen far short of what is needed to be done and have done little to diminish the extent of the desecration of gods name i am a member of both groups but i am dissatisfied with their stance which asks us to sit back patiently and wait for the results of a federal investigation on some level this might be prudent but on another it is unacceptable
2330873 hebrew national the folks who made the hot dogs etc used to run a commercial that said
2330874 has a proclivity for violating the act and has previously been found to have engaged in identical conduct
2330875 not only is the cruiser which lies in the middle of a tourist paradise full of environmentally hazardous chemicals it turns out that it contains radioactive material as well
2330876 in his original letter simonsen referred to pcbs and toxic flame retarding organic bromines there have been suspicions about the existence of chemicals like this dating back to 2004 but nothing had been confirmed claims that there were radioactive materials on board were entirely new to me
2330877 the city of denver and the secret service are now free to confine ordinary citizens to a
2330878 we have felt that the citys stance on this issue was based on their desire to suppress the demonstrations and any message that exposes the democratic partys refusal to end the war
2330879 it was a very adverse decision where the federal courts are willing to throw away peoples civil liberties in the name of security
2330880 overall the regrettable thing is courts are deferring to security planners who base their plans many times on risks that are extremely speculative and the result is all of our first amendment rights are diminished
2330881 we intend to march and we still intend to go to the pepsi center
2330882 an alpaca is like a mix between a llama and a poodle
2330883 my father feels worse than i do because he lost the gold but hes done a lot for sport in our country
2330884 i think coming from a sporting background is the reason im a professional golfer
2330885 there were a couple of tee shots here and there that werent 100 percent but i scrambled nicely one under par on this course im thrilled with it
2330886 the challenge with the pin placement is if you want to try to fire make up some ground and fire at the pin youre not always able to do that on the next hole you might have to wait two or three holes to try it
2330887 twenty five to 30 million unsafe cribs are sold in thrift stores and resale furniture stores each year
2330888 by requiring these unsafe cribs to be taken off the market be made safe or destroyed this legislation would help to reduce the number of injuries and deaths that occur in cribs each year
2330889 as mccain and obama slug it out to differentiate themselves from each other and the current administration the reality of a growing federal budget deficit weak economic conditions and prospects that the economy could deteriorate further and a widening income gap make certain policy shifts inevitable
2330890 some things like increased regulation higher overall tax rates and constraints on government spending are inevitable regardless of who gets elected and what he has promised
2330891 do not expect either candidate to actually be able to deliver on his pre election promises given the political reality of an economy that is likely to get worse before it gets better it would be wise for the next president to focus more on policy than on his prospects for re election in 2012 but that may be optimistic given the length of presidential campaigns
2330892 the more things change the more they stay the same
2330893 there are two things that you would need to get a signal to other planets firstly it has to be able to leave our planet secondly it would have to have as much power as possible
2330894 as you go into space that power would dissipate they would need more and more sensitive equipment to pick it up
2330895 detecting a signal like this with lots of background noise would be incredibly hard but what they would look for is a pattern in the signals to show that they were not naturally occurring
2330896 some of our radars are easily detectable quite far hundreds of light years into space if the aliens wish to try and if theyre in the beam
2330897 of course no one more than about 50 70 light years away will have yet heard from us but i figure that our earliest broadcasts are washing over about one new star system each day so the potential audience is growing

2330900 reading howard zinns peoples history of the united states opened my eyes to the reality of what armed forces recruitment was really about
2330901 ralph naders supporters submitted nearly 17 000 petition signatures to state officials wednesday saying they have assured the longtime consumer activist from winsted a spot on the november presidential ballots connecticut independent party line
2330902 put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2330903 christian science monitor documents a wide ranging discussion nader held with reporters yesterday
2330904 the democrats filed 24 lawsuits in 18 states in 12 weeks to get us off the ballot and harassed our petitioners so we didnt get on a lot of ballots
2330905 all these candidates of the major parties know far more than they act on and that gap is the fortitude gap do they want to demonstrate political courage do they want to spend their capital
2330906 obama has demonstrated a decreasing level of fortitude a decreasing willingness to spend his capital i think for the bottom 100 million americans low income whites blacks and latinos he is not really associated in this town with any comprehensive proposal economic political social and we expect more of him
2330907 people who have fought the civil rights battle economically politically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees it doesnt look like it is going to be what we all thought it would be
2330908 i am thoroughly upset with the medias attention to the election candidates i wonder how many people know that there are six candidates for the presidency yet all we ever hear about are the republican and the democrat we also have former congressman bob barr of the libertarian party pastor and radio talk show host chuck baldwin of the constitution party former congresswoman cynthia mckinney of the green party and ralph nader who is running as an independent i thought the money the candidates raised for their campaigns was for the paid media coverage as well as the traveling they do this makes me wonder if they also pay to have normal news coverage dvd stop loss
2330909 influential iraqi shiite cleric moqtada al sadr would dissolve his mehdi army militia if the united states starts withdrawing troops according to a set timetable a spokesman said as noted in yesterdays snapshot a number of editorial boards weighed in on the topic of who pays for iraqi reconstruction this morning others join in from the while the united states pours money into rebuilding efforts iraq cant be bothered to spend its own money on essentials like water sewer power or road systems the billions in petrodollars are sitting in the bank while u s taxpayers continue paying a long distance infrastructure program thats cost 48 billion since the invasion five years ago the reasons arent convincing iraqi officials claim their fragile central government isnt ready for the challenge of a major rebuild an answer thats distressingly similar to excuses about why american troops are still needed to prop up baghdad more time for either political or brick and mortar work isnt an option baghdad needs to get going on both fronts and the unspent billions should ease the way the country is at a new point where iraqi leadership political compromise and billions in reserves could produce a more stable society in truth iraqis have had little incentive to spend their own money given the willingness of the united states congress to keep writing blank checks for president bushs disastrous adventure there congress has appropriated 48 billion for rebuilding in iraq since 2003 and committed all but 6 billion of that amount mostly for oil electricity water and security projects by contrast between 2005 and 2007 when all that oil revenue was piling up only 3 9 billion of iraqs budget went to reconstruction an even tinier amount went to maintaining united states and iraqi financed projects like roads bridges buildings water and electrical installations that raises serious questions about the wisdom of making those capital investments in the first place if they are not going to be properly tended one of the bush administrations most damaging postinvasion decisions is at the heart of this problem in its ill considered dismissal of everybody who had any connection to saddam husseins baath party american overseers depleted the ranks of iraqi bureaucrats who had the skills and experience to run an oil producing country of about 27 million people americans stiffed by iraq
2330910 i want to carry out this public office for the people so my campaign has to be for the people as well
2330911 when the u s first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaida and
2330912 i made the best decision regardless of what hardships i go through i could have put iraqi families through more hardships i have no regrets
2330913 yeah if it came down to that id be willing to go to prison because i know i did the right thing and i can sleep at night and my conscience is still good
2330914 i support robin long because he is a soldier of conscience there is a huge propaganda campaign in this country to get young men to join the military he bought the hype he signed up for a promised non combat job but it turned out not to be so he decided to go to canada and follow his conscience instead
2330915 in considerably good spirits especially considering all that he is going through
2330916 aware of what he might have to face and is prepared to face it with courage and without bitterness
2330917 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2330918 washington post which is a lengthy article and apparently other us reporters stationed in iraq tired themselves out just watching the two produce the article
2330919 the tactical team is finished and its a closed deal but remember that weve been through this before and every time we close a deal its reopened
2330920 weve seen all the status of forces agreements with other countries
2330921 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2330922 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2330923 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2330924 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2330925 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2330926 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2330927 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2330928 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2330929 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2330930 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2330931 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2330932 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2330933 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2330934 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2330935 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2330936 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2330937 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2330938 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2330939 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
2330940 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away
2330941 s ger hon fr gande med ett psykoleende som bara en kristen idiot kan b rnna av det r f r att det r b g
2330942 hey freds note about you kissing your dog gave me a thought i was thinking thats not so bad but itd be better if it were a cat then i was thinking that precious probably feels left out with all these dog pictures floating around what about your cat for gosh sakes show her a little love
2330943 this mean my case will never be heard by the supreme court and my quest for justice failed and i will never be vindicated legally although i have come to accept this and knew of the possibility it has been disheartening i dont need outside sources to validate me i know who i am and i know what is in my heart
2330944 currently i am involved in peace work and speak as much as i can to at risk youth
2330945 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2330946 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2330947 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2330948 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2330949 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2330950 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2330951 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2330952 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2330953 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2330954 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2330955 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2330956 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2330957 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2330958 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2330959 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2330960 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2330961 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2330962 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2330963 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2330964 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues
2330965 mahmoodd younis fathi was assassinated by gunmen in the city of mosul
2330966 and the director of religious schools for the sunni endowment
2330967 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2330968 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2330969 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand
2330970 they didnt roll back any of president bushs legislation when they took over in 2007
2330971 its exactly what karl rove wants us to do is to initiate impeachment
2330972 i think i got to go to the airport so i can get home
2330973 better to vote for someone you believe in and lose than someone you dont believe in and win
2330974 nader accuses the news media of being in a cultural rut by ignoring him he said hed been on national television only 10 seconds this election cycle put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2330975 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout

2330991 we may see a delay of two to four weeks for harvesting irrigated cotton
2330992 dryland cotton harvest probably will occur within the normal timeframe
2330993 the no 1 insect problem in cotton in the central and south delta is spider mites
2330994 hot dry weather is ideal for spider mite outbreaks and farmers worked hard to control them
2330995 glyphosate resistance is a hot issue in weed control because there are not many alternative chemistries available with the systems we have
2330996 the 2008 crop appears to be as good as or even a little bit above the average but it probably wont surpass the statewide average of 960 pounds per acre reached last year
2330997 farmers compare the relatively low prices for cotton with the higher prices for grain crops for cotton acreage to go back up the price farmers receive must be competitive with soybeans and corn

2331002 but i dont think the doors closed obviously right now were tied up with apb and everything else but hopefully in the future well have the resource and something can be worked out with microsoft

2331012 kami sudah beberapa kali membangkitkan perkara ini dengan pihak atasan namun masih tiada lagi tindakan yang diambil
2331013 jika perkara ini berterusan golongan peneroka yang sememangnya berpendapatan rendah akan terus dihimpit kesusahan
2331014 rata rata peneroka hanya menerima kurang rm1 500 sebulan ia tidak cukup akibat kenaikan harga minyak dan barang barang keperluan baru baru ini
2331015 ini sememangnya merugikan kami dan kebanyakan peneroka hanya bergantung kepada penjualan buah kelapa sawit ini serta tiada sumber pendapatan yang lain
2331016 kami sudah tidak sanggup berhadapan masalah ladang kami yang terbiar begitu sahaja dan merugikan kami kerana harga kelapa sawit dan getah kini semakin meningkat akibat permintaan yang tinggi

2331020 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2331021 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2331022 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2331023 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2331024 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2331025 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2331026 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2331027 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2331028 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2331029 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
2331030 for everyones sake dont surrender to laziness in the spelling of english
2331031 my favorite part of the hospital is the quiet which the cats love also
2331032 you never have to raise your voice over barking dogs and you never get dragged up the hallway by an overexcited himalayan
2331033 growing up i always thought i was going to north carolina state university but when it came time for me to make a decision ncsu just didnt feel right
2331034 i was ecstatic but my mother was completely against the idea
2331035 my dad and i drove to starkville for the first time and i just fell in love
2331036 i wanted a pet to keep me company while studying but i didnt want to be tied down with a dog and so i got a cat
2331037 noah was great company but always into everything so i decided to get another cat because everyone says two cats are better than one
2331038 i almost returned him afraid that i had picked out a feral cat
2331039 this was a devastating blow to a young woman just starting veterinary school and looking forward to a long productive life with her husband
2331040 the courage the perseverance the tenacity that this young lady showed even to stay in school was an inspiration to all of us
2331041 stephanie had a great interest in becoming a feline practitioner
2331042 she understood that cats cant be bullied into submission a veterinarian must use finesse to work with cats and get them to trust
2331043 the majority of cat people consider a cat like their child
2331044 they come in the hospital with a preconceived notion of whats wrong with their baby after reading information on the internet right wrong or indifferent you have to earn a persons trust just as you have to earn a cats trust
2331045 humor can help us get over rough ground when life has to change
2331046 shakespeare recognized the benefits of laughter as a calming influence and even used humor relief in his tragedies
2331047 as far back as the 1400s recorded history shows that doctors recognized the positive relationship of laughter to good health
2331048 maintaining health and regaining emotional balance is particularly important for seniors in stressful situations
2331049 if this doesnt get you laughing i have something else that will
2331050 laughing with someone makes you feel closer to that person
2331051 i promise to look at life through rose colored glasses to see the humor in everyday situations to giggle and belly laugh even if people look at me strangely and to share my laughter with others
2331052 as important as medical issues are you have to look a lot more broadly when youre thinking about healthy aging and social support tends to be a big issue
2331053 im very pleased that this project has led to the start up of two senior centers where people can socialize and learn about healthy living
2331054 we decided we wanted to develop community initiated projects and that we the university werent going to solve the issues ourselves
2331055 if you get the community excited about certain things they can start something carry it forward and sustain the project
2331056 people would say there was no transportation for seniors in their county but in some counties it turned out there was transportation through the area agency on aging
2331057 people didnt necessarily know about it we also wanted people thinking about what was working in some rural areas people know each other better and there is more informal care giving than in larger areas where people assume there are formal support systems
2331058 we were able to establish a dialogue and help communities determine local priorities but then they did the work and turned their dreams into reality
2331059 you dont have to be a health educator or a health professional to be a lay health volunteer
2331060 we train our volunteers and equip them with the materials to deliver health messages to various senior adult groups or in one on one settings
2331061 with this being a volunteer program the volunteers agree to provide 20 hours of community service over a one year period
2331062 the benefits of volunteering have been documented in various studies focusing on others rather than yourself can many times help you forget some of your own ailments
2331063 i ask you to rise quietly and with dignity and go home
2331064 theres a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part and youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop and youve got to indicate to the people who run it to the people who own it that unless youre free the machine will be prevented from working at all

2331074 seventeen that was a 5 or 6 iron in the ryder cup now its as good a 3 iron as i can hit or a cutting 5 wood and the ninth that was 262 yards in practice so i guess its a par 4
2331075 i noticed they have given us a bit of fairway short of 17 and nine so if you want you can lay up
2331076 a big 3 wood to get to nine and a good 3 wood to get to 17 he said
2331077 thats a lot of holes theyre supposed to be short holes right isnt that what a par 3 is short

2331085 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2331086 gay and lesbian people grow up with the same hopes that other people do that theyll be able to celebrate their love for one another with family and friends gathered around pledging their support for the faithful monogamous lifelong intentioned holy vows theyve just taken i have always longed for such a day

2331112 but i am sure some of mr zumas defenders will argue that the rule is just hunky dory
2331113 of course it must be difficult for you when your god doesnt quite live up to the ideal

2331125 we are extremely excited about the recognition the pam2842 has received by the led lighting industry as it has already been used in many led lighting applications this innovative high power led driver with the widest input voltage range from 5v battery applications to 40v automotive applications satisfies many stringent lighting requirements
2331126 in addition when used as a buck type constant current dc dc driver to control leds for solar cell powered lighting the pam2842 at 30 watts delivers the highest power for this expanding energy saving market
2331127 we recognized an unmet need for lighting class performance in a small footprint low profile led package these products based on an innovative new technology platform address this need

2331131 one night another agent and i were on lp op assignments approximately 250 yards from a known drop location my partner was equipped with a typical gen 3 greenlight night vision scope and i with my supervision using supervisions zoom feature i was able to capture all the targets activities including bundle exchanges but all my partner could see was ants on the hillside i looked through his greenlight scope for comparison and saw exactly that just ants on a hillside
2331132 this is typical of the feedback we receive from police and public safety officers representing more than 80 departments around the country supervision delivers the nighttime surveillance capabilities our customers have long been looking for but could not find before even with the most expensive gen 3 equipment supervision is proving itself in the field to be an invaluable tool that helps police and public safety officers perform their difficult jobs better easier and safer

2331147 iraqs electoral commission had said the measure needed to be passed before lawmakers adjourned for the month in order to hold elections by the end of december
2331148 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2331149 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2331150 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2331151 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2331152 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2331153 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2331154 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2331155 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2331156 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2331157 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2331158 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2331159 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2331160 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2331161 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2331162 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2331163 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2331164 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2331165 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2331166 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2331167 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2331168 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2331169 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2331170 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion
2331171 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of light armored vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 3 billion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of technical assistance for construction of facilities and infrastructure as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billiion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of helicopters and related munitions as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 4 billion
2331172 we dont think it makes sense to plan for a mass march that might not end up being all that mass
2331173 im not going to iraq to fight in some bullshit war about oil money
2331174 bullshit war what about 9 11 didnt iran hide the terrorists
2331175 we are fighting a war in i r a q doug and neither country has anything to do with blowing up the world trade centre

2331409 secondo documenti della commissione elettorale federale barack obama ha ricevuto donazioni illegali da palestinesi che vivono a gaza focolaio dei terroristi di hamas
2331410 la questione fondamentale osserva la schlussel che si tratta di donazioni assolutamente illegali questo il primo punto in secondo luogo c sta stabilire come la campagna di obama sia riuscita a nascondere il fatto hanno scritto che le donazioni provenivano da rafah georgia
2331411 disposta ad accettare migliaia di dollari in eccesso al limite imposto dalla legge e ad infischiarsene delle restrizioni della commissione elettorale federale
2331412 non si preoccupano minimamente dei particolari n di infrangere la legge pur di raggiungere il loro obiettivo finale
2331413 un candidato presidenziale che riceve soldi da un bastione del terrorismo islamico dovrebbe fare veramente scalpore come notizia
2331414 si tirano indietro per aiutare barack obama a coprire qualsiasi notizia negativa che lo riguardi
2331415 there have definitely been significant advancements made at legal and policy levels and i have no wish to belittle them
2331416 but our latest research shows that while these policy changes are admirable they are not making it down to the shop floor
2331417 there is now a significant disconnect between improved policy positions on workplace equality and diversity and the everyday realities of life for britains many gay workers and it is clear there is still a lot of ground to cover before the uk can claim a true sexuality neutral and equal opportunity work environment
2331418 the pink plateau does still exist and its similar to the glass ceiling in many respects even though unlike gender peoples sexuality is invisible
2331419 coming out has traditionally meant long term damage to your career prospects
2331420 we believe that if firms want to get the best out of their people they need to create a culture where they feel free to be themselves for the senior people this will inevitably lead to more authentic leadership and for the workforce generally it is clear that putting your energy into hiding your sexual orientation leaves less energy for doing your job well
2331421 we have had a general employee diversity policy in place since 1953 and although we are not able to collect specific statistics on the sexuality of our staff we believe that ibm senior management not only understands the issues but is geared up to fully support any member of staff who does decide to come out
2331422 we work hard to create an environment which gives people the choice to be open about their sexuality and which allows them to give their best at work without having to pretend that they are someone different we promote solely on merit in this organisation and the fact that some of our senior people are both out and highly visible speaks for itself
2331423 i am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of christ jesus

2331427 theres definitely a place in the marketplace for movies that can be enjoyed by the whole family and have an educational component
2331428 thats the whole point of the movie right to take away this concept of the fourth dimension that we cant necessarily point to
2331429 critical thought is so important to always try to find new knowledge to never just accept things as youre told they are
2331430 whats often commonly accepted isnt always necessarily true and i hope people have the courage to question what is known and search for whats next
2331431 math is so much more than problems on your test page
2331432 the student whos going to solve that is probably a high school student right now and is not going to be motivated by a standardized test
2331433 happiness is an elusive state of mind not to be gained by clumsy pursuit it is given to those who do not sue for it to be unconcerned about a desired good is probably the only way to possess it

2331437 i really dont want to think about it any more i dont like to talk about it and on top of that i dont really know that much i dont know what happened to him after he was kidnapped i dont even have a picture of him
2331438 i would like to ask your forgiveness for having killed american soldiers
2331439 from the onset of the war it was clear that south korean soldiers were like kindergarteners and north korean soldiers were like college students if there were to be a second korean war south korea would lose the day that u s troops withdraw from south korea is the day that north korea invades south korea
2331440 if the united states had not come to south koreas aid i would currently be a north korean communist
2331441 yeah whats wrong with pitchers today i remember billy odell alvin dark had him throw 170 pitches those were the days when men were men plus juan marichial threw many a complete game
2331442 of course billys career ended early so did juan marichial they all ended in their early 30s jim palmer too in fact he was used so much his first season they had to shut him down for two years from a shoulder injury a shoulder injury and somehow he recovered from that to have a hall of fame career i guess teams learned that they should protect their pitchers better in order to extend their careers
2331443 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2331444 and you will be hated by all for my names sake but the one who endures to the end will be saved
2331445 if one has endured to the end he will be saved
2331446 it is the one who by enduring to the end who will be saved
2331447 it is the one who has endured who will be saved
2331448 it is the one who has endured who will be justified
2331449 it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved
2331450 it is the one who has endured to the end who will be justified
2331451 much more then having now been justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath of god through him
2331452 teaches that perseverance is the inescapable experience that all believers undergo before they come into the glory of final salvation
2331453 christ does not say it is the one who has endured who will be justified christ says will be saved there is a great difference
2331454 the one who perseveres to the end will be saved
2331455 the one who perseveres to the end will be justified
2331456 conditional warnings and admonitions suspend gods judgment in the last day on perseverance in this age since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification with the effect that pauls orientation on salvation as not yet fully realized has virtually collapsed for paul justification remains fundamentally the eschatological verdict
2331457 but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved
2331458 it is the one who by enduring to the end who will be saved
2331459 and you will be hated by all for my names sake but the one who endures to the end will be saved

2331463 whatever is opposed to life itself such as any type of murder genocide abortion euthanasia or wilful self destruction whatever violates the integrity of the human person such as mutilation torments inflicted on body or mind attempts to coerce the will itself whatever insults human dignity such as subhuman living conditions arbitrary imprisonment deportation slavery prostitution the selling of women and children as well as disgraceful working conditions where people are treated as mere instruments of gain rather than as free and responsible persons all these things and others like them are infamies indeed they poison human society and they do more harm to those who practise them than to those who suffer from the injury moreover they are a supreme dishonour to the creator
2331464 just as a century ago it was the working classes which were oppressed in their fundamental rights and the church very courageously came to their defence by proclaiming the sacrosanct rights of the worker as a person so now when another category of persons is being oppressed in the fundamental right to life the church feels in duty bound to speak out with the same courage on behalf of those who have no voice hers is always the evangelical cry in defence of the worlds poor those who are threatened and despised and whose human rights are violated
2331465 to every particular family in every part of the world
2331466 the voice of your brothers blood cries to me from the ground
2331467 cain rose up against his brother abel and killed him
2331468 god did not make death and he does not delight in the death of the living for he has created all things that they might exist god created man for incorruption and made him in the image of his own eternity but through the devils envy death entered the world and those who belong to his party experience it
2331469 and when they were in the field cain rose up against his brother abel and killed him
2331470 cain said to abel his brother let us go out to the field
2331471 its desire is for you but you must master it
2331472 in the account of abels murder by his brother cain scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man consequences of original sin from the beginning of human history
2331473 for this is the message which you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another and not be like cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother
2331474 cain does not wish to think about his brother and refuses to accept the responsibility which every person has towards others
2331475 put a mark on cain lest any who came upon him should kill him
2331476 once the crime is admitted at the very inception of this sinful act of parricide then the divine law of gods mercy should be immediately extended if punishment is forthwith inflicted on the accused then men in the exercise of justice would in no way observe patience and moderation but would straightaway condemn the defendant to punishment god drove cain out of his presence and sent him into exile far away from his native land so that he passed from a life of human kindness to one which was more akin to the rude existence of a wild beast god who preferred the correction rather than the death of a sinner did not desire that a homicide be punished by the exaction of another act of homicide
2331477 what have you done the voice of your brothers blood is crying to me from the ground
2331478 is unleashed this conspiracy involves not only individuals in their personal family or group relationships but goes far beyond to the point of damaging and distorting at the international level relations between peoples and states
2331479 with time the threats against life have not grown weaker they are taking on vast proportions they are not only threats coming from the outside from the forces of nature or the cains who kill the abels no they are scientifically and systematically programmed threats the twentieth century will have been an era of massive attacks on life an endless series of wars and a continual taking of innocent human life false prophets and false teachers have had the greatest success
2331480 involving even international institutions engaged in encouraging and carrying out actual campaigns to make contraception sterilization and abortion widely available
2331481 how is it still possible to speak of the dignity of every human person when the killing of the weakest and most innocent is permitted
2331482 truly truly i say to you every one who commits sin is a slave to sin
2331483 my punishment is greater than i can bear behold you have driven me this day away from the ground and from your face i shall be hidden and i shall be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will slay me
2331484 my offences truly i know them my sin is always before me against you you alone have i sinned what is evil in your sight i have done
2331485 without the creator the creature would disappear but when god is forgotten the creature itself grows unintelligible
2331486 and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct

2331496 new microchipped passports designed to be foolproof against identity theft can be cloned and manipulated in minutes and accepted as genuine by the computer software recommended for use at international airports tests for the times exposed security flaws in the microchips introduced to protect against terrorism and organised crime the flaws also undermine claims that 3 000 blank passports stolen last week were worthless because they could not be forged in the tests a computer researcher cloned the chips on two british passports and implanted digital images of osama bin laden and a suicide bomber the altered chips were then passed as genuine by passport reader software used by the un agency that sets standards for e passports
2331497 using his own software a publicly available programming code a 40 card reader and two 10 rfid chips mr van beek took less than an hour to clone and manipulate two passport chips to a level at which they were ready to be planted inside fake or stolen paper passports a baby boys passport chip was altered to contain an image of osama bin laden and the passport of a 36 year old woman was changed to feature a picture of hiba darghmeh a palestinian suicide bomber who killed three people in 2003 the unlikely identities were chosen so that there could be no suggestion that either mr van beek or the times was faking viable travel documents
2331498 the home office said last night that it had yet to see evidence of someone being able to manipulate data in an e passport
2331499 no one has yet been able to demonstrate that they are able to modify change or alter data within the chip
2331500 south carolina is a wonderful family friendly destination not a southern version of san francisco this campaign goes against our core values
2331501 our state tourism dollars should be talking about the beaches and attractions of south carolina

2331503 it was kind of a no brainer for us because it was only 5 000

2331505 gays and lesbians have only in recent years begun to enjoy improved social status and acceptance as part of that ongoing process certain terms are reclaimed by gays and lesbians as a means of removing previous negative connotations
2331506 the phrase so gay when used as an insult is hurtful to many gay and lesbian people out now felt the opportunity existed to communicate to the target audience and a wider audience as it now turns out that being so gay is not at all negative to gay and lesbian people
2331507 gay and lesbian tourists are as diverse as the mainstream there is no such thing as a single gay and lesbian market our job was to sell each location utilizing its strongest assets
2331508 its a unit thing and i think no doubt that chris presence was a difference for us today

2331511 saudi arabia mnn the washington dc based human rights group international christian concern icc has learned that saudi arabia deported 15 christians on tuesday august 5th for holding private worship meetings in a house in the city of taif
2331512 theyll say we dont want political pressure so once foreign christians are arrested they release them quickly the next thing you know the whole group is deported out of the country
2331513 they would be arrested they would be in grave danger and those are the cases unfortunately we cant talk about theres tremendous pressure to convert them back to islam
2331514 the saudi king is saying that christians and muslims need to get along better then look at whats happening at home this just shows and exposes the heart of saudi beliefs they can spend money and spin things and they can do pr but what matters is what happens at home
2331515 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
2331516 there is a tremendous hunger for bibles in the persecuted church
2331517 you could see up to 30 people sharing one bible
2331518 saudi arabias human rights commission hrc will urge its counterparts in the european union to ask their governments not to link terrorism to islam and also to issue regulations to protect muslims from prejudice and discrimination because of their faith
2331519 the government funded rights body will also address various human rights issues in europe when muslims are unjustly interrogated treated with disrespect physically or mentally abused or not allowed to practice their faith freely such as muslim girls being prevented from wearing the hijab head cover in some schools

2331526 i am disappointed that the federal court is not able to vindicate a simple but important fundamental right that exists in all persons namely the right to believe in the religion of ones choice and equally important the right to marry a person of ones choice and to raise a family in the malaysia context
2331527 the federal court has not only denied me that right but to all malaysians who value fundamental freedoms
2331528 i am hoping that my case would have made a difference to the development of constitutional issues in the plight of many others
2331529 it would extremely difficult to exercise freedom of conscience in the present environment

2331557 the first time i saw schiller it was in the salon of the duke and duchess of weimar among a society as enlightened as it was imposing he read french very well but had never spoken it i was holding forth warmly about the superiority of french drama over all others he couldnt hold back from arguing with me and without any anxiety about the difficulties of expressing himself in french or fearing the opinion of those who might hear him contrary to his own his deep conviction made him speak at first i used those french weapons liveliness and wit to answer him but soon i discovered in what schiller said so many ideas notwithstanding the barrier of words i was struck by the simplicity of character that this man of genius had in so engaging himself in a struggle where his own ideas lacked the words to express them i found him modest and careless about his own success so proud and animated in defence of what he believed to be true that i gave him from that moment my friendship and my full admiration

2331570 to me it is remarkable that we want to say athletes should shut up and just play
2331571 in everyday context they are good enough to tell us what cereals to eat what shoes to wear about anti obesity or whatever but when it comes to a fundamental tenet of human rights somehow they are not good enough

2331575 by right there should be a mechanism to control this phenomenon including classifying web bloggers as professionals and non professionals
2331576 this classification will facilitate legal action to be taken against those found to have violated the countrys laws we have to control this it is feared that these blogs will be misused by those who have an agenda to spread slander
2331577 should blog sites be recognised as an alternative press it would force newspapers out of business

2331599 i had to have a nightlight on in my room for like 15 years i was terrified
2331600 hopefully we show that theres a certain intellect to that
2331601 why fractional reserve banking is more libertarian than the gold standard

2331607 its our fifth year and were still kind of in shock with how successful its been
2331608 a lot of people who are going are going every year
2331609 i wish i could sell tickets to everyone who wants one
2331610 weve pretty much got our pick now of who we want
2331611 the high demand for festival access by visitors meanwhile has prompted initiatives by organizers to keep events local
2331612 many of the people booking tickets book them for as many evenings as they can get
2331613 by the end of the week they all know each other
2331614 the two businesses and their respective databases of book listings are not going to be combined and abebooks will continue to operate independently
2331615 qualified respectable responsible booksellers tend to use abebooks whereas less established less professional sellers guys who just have a closet full of books tend to sell their books on amazon
2331616 i cant imagine how amazon could have any more of a negative impact
2331617 i have to sell the silly books somewhere and the competing sites arent as good or are just a little harder to use
2331618 they are the most active player in the market and i dont think we could do as well with any of the other competing portals none of them has the profile that abebooks has
2331619 well done guv you type 62 words a minute arent you freaking special for a retarded person
2331620 fiat group extends its apologies to the government of the peoples republic of china and to the chinese people the choice of mr richard gere in connection with the launch of lancia delta was based on his long and distinguished career in the arts and the choice of the subject matter by mr gere is a reflection of our commitment to artistic freedom of expression this choice should not be understood as an endorsement by fiat group of mr geres social and political views
2331621 a reflection of our commitment to artistic freedom of expression

2331623 ah ha so obama was right that tire inflation can save as much gasoline as offshore drilling we just have to do it for about two thirds of a millennium
2331624 estimating buying power can be an important business measure for companies and policy decision makers
2331625 this offers us a reasonable snapshot of the projected economic activity of americas diverse gay lesbian bisexual and transgender population
2331626 buying power is not the same as affluence or wealth no one should infer that same sex households are more affluent than others we have seen evidence from academic researchers that gay men may earn slightly less than their heterosexual counterparts
2331627 the best available census data on same sex couples supports the understanding however that gay populations tend to be somewhat more concentrated in major metro areas and less likely to live in rural under populated areas a characteristic generally associated with higher than average income we also see that same sex couples are less likely than their married heterosexual counterparts to have kids and they are more likely to have both partners in the workforce factors which yield higher per capita household income especially in the case of gay male couples
2331628 i thought that we tackled a lot better than we did the first day of spring when we were wearing pads
2331629 i didnt like the way we executed our pass petrino said
2331630 we usually do better than that but we came back and got good work in on our inside run and did a nice job on live third downs
2331631 there is good competition between him jerry franklin and jermaine love all three are getting reps with the ones tenarius is a man that has great instincts and really knows the game the best thing is that he came into camp with the attitude that im going to play as a freshman and compete for a starting job so ive been very impressed with him
2331632 he has been very reliable on his routes and i think that hes faster than he was in the spring hes been real sharp and i think hes dropped one ball in five days so i am really happy with the way hes played
2331633 these findings reveal that gays and lesbians continue to make strong contributions to uk life accounting for almost 3 million people earning more than 80 billion of annual income gays and lesbians represent an important part of the uk s population they are also clearly an attractive target market for a growing number of brands we anticipate further uplift in the number of brands actively targeting the uk s 3 million gay and lesbian consumers
2331634 one of the most striking things is the extent to which companies that reach out to gay and lesbian consumers with a targeted gay marketing program can expect to win their brand loyalty
2331635 for brands that get their communications and marketing strategy right the rewards from the gay market are potentially very large
2331636 the samples we looked at comprise users of the uk s leading gay and lesbian media products and they provide much insight into the state of gay and lesbian life in the uk in 2008 it is also important to point out that averages mask diversity and diversity is one of the primary hallmarks of gay life in the uk today
2331637 not all gays and lesbians reflect the average findings and that is very important to keep in mind a key message from this research is how diverse the uk s 3 million gays and lesbians are
2331638 with such a high worth placed on the pink consumer and the segment s higher than average earnings it is no surprise that the study has confirmed very high levels of social and leisure activity in terms of internet usage and spend shopping travel and going out as well as this high level of leisure and social activity 80 of gay bi and lesbian web users spends 7 hours more online each week than the uk average despite the current credit crunch from these figures it appears there has never been a better time to be targeting this audience
2331639 the biggest difference is being the one who makes the final decisions
2331640 were really lucky to have a great staff and honestly it really hasnt been that big of a change from any other preseason
2331641 it is with sadness that matt and kevin announce that their relationship has come to an end their separation is amicable
2331642 darkened with as much bronzer as laurence olivier in othello
2331643 ummm theres too much foam on my grande nonfat half caff vanilla latte
2331644 omg he didnt open the door for me does that mean he doesnt like me
2331645 i cant stand a girl who wont crack a smile on a date
2331646 you mean while i sit on my butt and wait for my zivug bashert
2331647 it was advertised in the newspapers that there would be no advance ticket bookings for this movie in coliseum
2331648 the cinema can accommodate 800 people so how did they manage to sell more than 1 000 tickets in such a short time
2331649 each person is only allowed to purchase five tickets so if 10 people bought five tickets that would mean 50 tickets were sold where are the rest
2331650 this happens every time we must put a full stop to this
2331651 we supported him and the cinema back then but look at what coliseum has done to us now
2331652 i called coliseum and they told that you cannot book the tickets
2331653 i called the cinema at 5pm and was told that the counter would open at 5 30pm i rushed here after work and they told me that there were no tickets left i am very disappointed

2331677 in the city as anywhere else lesbian women face the double whammy of not only being female but also being homosexual
2331678 in very macho banking circles there may be a growing tolerance towards out males but as long as lesbians are viewed as little more than a turn on for straight men it is hardly surprising that women who want their career ambitions to be taken seriously are reluctant to come out
2331679 if you are out to everyone or out to no one at least there is a single position for you in your social interactions at work when you conceal your sexuality usually for career related reasons everybody loses out

2331709 wir arbeiten bereits an der dvd und blu ray version seit monaten
2331710 ich hatte ja keine ahnung was mit der blu ray alles m glich ist wir werden das format bis zum anschlag ausreizen
2331711 es wird eine extended version geben und au erdem noch zahlreiche deleted scenes allerdings wird der film nur um ein paar minuten l nger werden
2331712 mitten am abend drehte er sich zu seiner frau um und sagte ich habe den neuen captain gefunden aber danach hat es noch immer sechs monate gedauert bis ich die rolle hatte weil paramount mich nicht wollte
2331713 man bestellte mich drei mal zur ck nach los angeles zum vorsprechen schlie lich waren nur noch ich und ein anderer schauspieler in der auswahl ich habe nie erfahren wer der andere war aber ich hatte eine ahnung und da sie es mir nie gesagt haben denke ich dass ich mit meiner vermutung richtig lag
2331714 ich hatte vor filme zu machen aber ich hatte nie damit gerechnet dass es wirklichkeit werden w rde manche leute sagen ich h tte meine karriere berzogen geplant vom tag an an dem ich die schauspielschule verlie wusste ich genau was ich machen wollte und ich habe so gut wie all das erreicht ich wollte immer bei einer theater gesellschaft arbeiten ich hatte kein interesse am fernsehen ich wollte auf der b hne stehen und am liebsten klassisches theater spielen
2331715 ich hatte eine amerikanerin geheiratet lebte in los angeles alles sah danach aus als sollte mein leben sich weiterhin dort abspielen aber dann wurde mir klar dass ich keine strahlende hollywood karriere haben w rde star trek war obwohl es eine fantastische erfahrung gewesen ist zu einem handikap geworden regisseure sagten patrick ist gut aber hat diesen m hlstein um den hals
2331716 ich dachte gestern abend was f r ein privileg f r die n chsten sechs monate kann ich diesem tollen schauspieler in einem der besten st cke der welt zuh ren und ich werde auch noch daf r bezahlt er hat einen wundervollen sinn f r spontanit t was f r einen richtig guten hamlet so wichtig ist er verf gt ber gro artige freiheit der gef hle er ist sehr engagiert hat viel energie ist in gro artiger verfassung und er ist ein wirklich netter kerl
2331717 the dawning of a brand new day in your chest
2331718 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
2331719 if you structure your material well google will understand the site you should use keywords in your site to draw in visitors use the language they do
2331720 if you used wordtracker to carry out keyword research on this phrase you would soon find that sustainable buildings isnt the best word to use
2331721 this shows you the keywords most people are searching for so thats what you should be writing in your headlines copy and title tags
2331722 you have got to get the structure right its the foundation of the website make it easy for journalists to publish make sure its seo friendly make sure you can easily build categories and reply to comments
2331723 for example the seagull problem and the bbc website the bbc didnt optimize for seagulls but they did come top because of the structure and due to the fact that they used keywords
2331724 must use meaningful words in their headlines and in their copy
2331725 if you tell a journalist that its their job to use keywords in their stories they will quite rightly tell you where to go however if you tell a journalist to use the words which will make their stories easily found by readers and get more response and comment then journalists are much more likely to listen writers want to be listened to and their articles read and responded to
2331726 if a publisher concentrates on these three things they will do really well if you dont do any of them you undermine the whole effort

2331731 it opened my eyes to a number of things i didnt know that 12 000 sikh soldiers passed through brighton hospitals in the two world wars
2331732 this is uncovering the history and telling the story of the huge contribution
2331733 this will give people a better understanding of our background and the unique anglo sikh relationship
2331734 the story needs to be told a true multi cultural society is one that understands that relationship and the sacrifices that have been made
2331735 we have only started to uncover what is out there

2331749 theres an old saying that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its probably a duck
2331750 and i think we know a duck when we see one
2331751 ideally they would like it that the only thing the new entrants can pick up is people who already dont have cellphones which is a lot tougher sell
2331752 its going to be tougher for the new entrants especially if they see most of the subscribers when they move into the market already locked into three year contracts
2331753 i suspect that what some of the carriers might be trying to do is to get folks to sign up for extended contracts over the next year
2331754 theres going to be lots of choice out there lots of opportunities to get really good deals and find all sorts of devices and i would imagine there are all sorts of services that i havent even begun to think of i think back to school next year there are going to be come exciting offers
2331755 since those phones are normally quite expensive they will heavily subsidize them in order to get people to come in and get longer term contracts
2331756 i would do it if i were them i would try to make sure that my customer base is more secure and offer something in advance of a new entrant such as a globalive being out there its going to take time to build our network so they might as well get a jump on us
2331757 a highly competitive wireless landscape is business as usual for rogers
2331758 we have always operated and thrived in a highly competitive environment providing high value plans and services to an increasing customer base
2331759 well it looks like half of amherst county is here i mean i didnt know near that many people would show up for this but they are
2331760 i had no idea it was this many people going to be here today i figured people had to work today they must of taken off work just so they could come over here to this sale
2331761 we dont want to be working west campus which is a major entrance in to virginia tech and have issues where we would have to close a lane which would cause major delays major issues around a football weekend its just not a good idea
2331762 when i look at the prices there i mean im fascinated
2331763 i come up on occasion to hang out at the book store i love to get the books from here theyre a bargain
2331764 certainly among goodwills probably the largest or among the largest in the united states
2331765 they heard about us and said what are you doing so we had some conversations and sent them some stuff by email
2331766 just to see the prices that theyre selling them for theres no reason why anyone shouldnt have a book to read
2331767 at least you can sit at home and read if nothing else laughs
2331768 wow we are here we are in the area the community the destination where such historic events where the battle and surrender took place
2331769 which is about three miles to the east of appomattox and the town of appomattox did not even exist when that happened
2331770 nobody believes the entire nation gathered in appomattox and voted to reunite
2331771 where the surrender took place i mean is over there this was just a train station what the heck
2331772 that statement does not say welcome to the town of appomattox where the surrender took place which is the historic event its out of that event that came our branding our marketing slogan
2331773 if you are going to represent yourself one way then it should be accurate

2331791 last year was just a new experience i didnt know what to expect
2331792 so i was just going in wide open but now i know what to expect in the games and how to properly prepare myself i feel like ive matured a great deal because im not as nervous going into a game situation
2331793 its tremendous because we get to use the same technique and were not always having to change it
2331794 the biggest thing for the offensive line is having the consistency because we have to work as a group and you cant do that if dont have the same coach from year to year
2331795 the o line is making calls and were hitting at the right angles with the right technique
2331796 the spring helped us out with depth because the younger guys got work so weve got a good solid first and second string
2331797 i just wanted to be out there playing with my boys after missing the spring i dont want to miss anymore
2331798 right now im striving for a whole lot higher percentage i know i can do a lot better because there were a lot of plays that i look at now while watching film and say how did i miss that how did i miss this the year of experience has helped me out with that
2331799 probably the fastest guys that he was going to go up against all year
2331800 they were two of the fastest ones that i went up against
2331801 south floridas george selvie was pretty fast as well those three are probably the fastest that ive gone up against along with willie young from n c state
2331802 but darius is still out there kicking and i know we brought in some young guys that have got speed so thats helped me out in practice and now im going against darrius massenburg so im getting the opposite end of the spectrum im getting the big 300 pounders too
2331803 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2331804 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2331805 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2331806 i hit a couple out there that might have got close to 400 today
2331807 that was the goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team
2331808 ive put myself in a situation where i have a chance you can play for your country and to do it in your home state that would be a dream come true
2331809 i really felt like i almost shot the highest score i could have shot today
2331810 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2331811 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much but if every time you hit it you hit it right where youre looking then whale away
2331812 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2331813 i just like tough conditions if you did a stat over the lasts five years who made the most pars i probably have one of the top 10 averages on tour my birdie average is toward the end of the pack
2331814 we are really excited about this year its a lot different from the past
2331815 it gives us a chance to go play and have fun
2331816 oh yeah its extremely different tuesday was my first crack at actually doing it full speed and i learned a lot from one day it was fun
2331817 everything will be different with pads on but the technique stays the same and the speed stays same youre responsibilities remain the same the only difference is a little more grunt to it
2331818 that helps having albert back i said that earlier this week thats exciting for the rest of us john jacobs burkes myself all of us it gives us a chance to go play in a lot more one on one situations which we can go win

2331822 getups tv ad has hit the headlines as kevin rudd
2331823 over the last few years as i speak to more clients and hear their stories it has led me to believe that 80 of the business is scam
2331824 by that i mean that 80 of people in the business doing seo consultancy are either running an outright scam or they thought it was good to get into seo because its a hot area but they dont really know what theyre doing
2331825 i have never met a web design company or web design consultant who understands seo
2331826 ill look at it their website and i see that it hasnt actually been optimized in any kind of way or someone will say to me is my site search engine friendly i have a look at it and then go back to them and say no a few days later ill hear back from the company telling me that the web design firm is now charging them 2 000 to make it search engine friendly
2331827 dont trust web designers as far as search engine optimization goes even if they tell you they understand it they dont i used to say that a few understand it but im still waiting for them
2331828 if you have a store that sells candles you can play a few games to get links like creating a software download library for instance and anybody who wants to be in the download library has to link to you
2331829 the reality is that you need to go out there and build links
2331830 this guy i was talking to had a sports equipment store he doesnt think he has a lot of competition because this is an up and coming sport in the us
2331831 he said there were people blogging about this sport so i recommended he go to the bloggers and to those on forums and strike up a rapport with chatty messages that dont look spammy introduce yourself and your site tell them your story and say that your site will be of interest
2331832 some of those bloggers will check the site out write about it and link to it once that happens go back to them and tell them about your services your products or a promotion you are running
2331833 ask if they would be interested in using or reviewing the product and send them a sample keep hitting them in that way
2331834 if its a big blog you can ask them if they want to run a competition for their readers and no one else there are so many ways you can work with these people
2331835 i have never met a web design company or web design consultant who understands seo
2331836 we now have a database that makes it much better to try and follow this
2331837 i agree with chris that networking first is important because a community is more valuable i would love to grow my blog but a me first attitude doesnt help we can learn from one another and help each other out
2331838 i wholly believe that a corporate blog that reviews and talks about things related to the industry that your are in rather than what the ceos dog ate for breakfast can take your traffic to new heights in months
2331839 i used to blog for personal reasons because i wanted to write but then again i realized some people do like to read about what i have to say so why not monetize its not a lot of money true but eventually the blog becomes a testament to your credibility so its really quite cool
2331840 a good pr will know a journalists current interest areas and quickly assess how they match whats newsworthy about your business theyll also guide you in how to handle a press radio or tv interview effectively theyll know the interviewers style and will have prepared you with ways to brush off negativity in polite ways which make the interviewer quickly switch to the main event your key message
2331841 hiring a pr firm doesnt eliminate the actual work involved with getting coverage
2331842 as the very first point in the article pointed out the real key is determining what is interesting about your business thats often very hard work
2331843 as a pr pro i regard this as a fluke and a stroke of luck that they got coverage and thats how most stories are
2331844 i tried a seo co that bragged about how good they were out of 22 million sites they were 1 but the work they did on my site was less than acceptable i know seo and have optimized my own sites i already had good rankings but i wasnt in the top five on some of my keywords so i thought i would give this co a try for 300 they threw a few links on my site that were some of their existing clients im sure they did no research i had to tell them what to do then for an additional 100 a month they would throw a few more links on my site yippie they were fired before the 100 charge was due
2331845 the quick profit potential of seo lures too many ad agencies web designers and entrepreneurs down the quick and easy trail only to hurt their own clients and make legitimate seo an even harder sell down the road
2331846 half think im going to rip them off and the other half dont have a clue what i am suggesting they do to improve their sites
2331847 i backed out because i didnt know if shed be reliable or if the living situation would be too out of control

2331855 we are thrilled to be a part of pier park and have seen an incredible response both from the community and from summer visitors
2331856 as one of the first retailers at pier park we have found our opening at the center to be incredibly successful and overall a wonderful experience
2331857 we were very impressed with briannes knowledge of the game and commitment to advancing the program
2331858 briannes relationship with the players is also a valuable asset that we are sure will help make the transition as the new coach a smooth one
2331859 i am looking forward to la salle softballs future with brianne at the helm her youth will bring plenty of energy to the program and her previous experience with the team will add stability and continuity
2331860 we are very fortunate to have someone with michelles pedigree in the game joining us on the field this fall
2331861 she has been around great field hockey all of her life and those experiences will really help us advance the program
2331862 karon was a great player winner and leader throughout his chester high career

2331864 we lost some of the best runners in conference history last season but hopefully we can maintain what weve done for the last several years

2331876 oh my gawd even my i and you know how square i am knows that
2331877 it is an invaluable opportunity to take some of the leading travel and tour operators operating in the gay and lesbian uk market to a city as impressive and as relaxing as cologne
2331878 we are confident this will grow gay travel from the uk to the city and already initial results show this to be the case we are very pleased
2331879 you can often get only a sense of a place from a website or a brochure
2331880 getting to see the hotels first hand and meet the managers onsite does wonders at building the business for the benefit of all concerned most especially our gay travel customers
2331881 and on tuesday i rested and on wednesday ill rest again final thoughts on the 2008 pitchfork music festival and even more photos
2331882 amro worldwide helps to arrange the travel arrangements for some of the 3 million gays and lesbians living in the uk
2331883 our work helps local business in each of the regions we send travelers to we were heartened to see many strongly supportive remarks included amongst reader comments made in the reporting of this story in the us media targeting gay travel is not at all a moral issue in any sense it is all about treating this particular group of citizens with equality and respect something we consider very important in our dealings with all of amro worldwides customers
2331884 before today i would have said that many of the 3 million gays and lesbians in the uk making travel plans would now have been adding south carolina to their list of travel possibilities as a result of this campaign
2331885 that number will drop dramatically from here because the scprt seems to want to side with anti gay people against a campaign designed to sell tolerance and respect as well as sell gay travel from the perspective of the many hundreds of south carolinian businesses that rely in part on gay tourism for their survival this is not a moral issue in any way it is a business issue pure and simple
2331886 latest research suggests that around 5 of the south carolina taxpayers can be expected to be lesbian and gay i cant help wondering what they would make of this campaign it seems almost bizarre to suggest that spending a handful of dollars less than 5 000 in total out of a taxpayer budget of 10 5 million to attract uk gay travelers to consider visiting south carolina is somehow too much by rights the amount allocated to gay tourism spend in the annual budget should be over 500 000 were all these south carolinian gay taxpayer dollars to be allocated proportionately in the budget to attracting gay fellow travelers to visit
2331887 i did find one remark reported to be made by sen david thomas r greenville in the press to be of great concern
2331888 he says that the amro so gay campaign goes against south carolina core values given that the campaign is all about attracting business to the state through furthering principles of equality and respect his comments leave me wondering just what types of core values senator thomas thinks south carolina stands for
2331889 we really do hope people will still feel able to travel to south carolina
2331890 i think the destination has so much to offer any traveler and that was all we wanted to do to let gays and lesbians in the uk know that there is much to see and enjoy in the state it will be a shame if the actions of scprt today causes people to stay away causing their local tourism industry to suffer as a result
2331891 clearly we want the many thousands of gays and lesbians travelling to london pride next month to know that amro is a travel company with hand picked travel options designed especially for the gay travel market
2331892 we also wanted to send a clear message to everyone who sees this campaign that it is long past time that so gay should be used as a negative phrase of disapproval from where we sit and for all our many customers being described as so gay is not a negative thing at all we think it is just great to be so gay
2331893 for all people seeing this campaign it is important to know that using so gay as a putdown is far from clever in the eyes of lesbian and gay people
2331894 in a week where heinz lost its gay marketing mojo we are very proud to bring the gayest ever mainstream media advertising campaign to london underground
2331895 south carolina has a lot to offer gay travellers and we think that people may be surprised to see our destination reaching out to the gay market
2331896 we are delighted to be involved with the so gay campaign in particular as it sends a powerful positive message to everyone that there is nothing wrong at all with a destination being described as
2331897 to be gay in the uk in 2008 is far from insulting it is significant it is visible and it is now mainstream that is why we chose to run this particular campaign in underground stations rather than in gay media all consumers need to know that being so gay is now so okay
2331898 as an active member of the iglta amro has already proved itself to be at the forefront of gay travel
2331899 all our research shows that gay people appreciate being made to feel welcome above all else this campaign breaks new ground by using mainstream media to send the message that these destinations clearly embrace their gay visitors
2331900 i think its great that leading us travel destinations have bought into amro worldwides idea of reclaiming
2331901 not only will it make gay and lesbian travellers feel like these us cities want our custom and our kudos londons commuters will be forced to think twice before calling something

2331908 in order that he should sanctify it cleansing it by the washing of the water in the saying
2331909 what is there within your frame that speaks of cleansing and washing what utterance causes such things
2331910 we can make our mystical inference and feel like we have done a fair job of understanding the text
2331911 here we have a nt reference that has one foot in the ot and the other in the nt and concludes that our consciences are cleansed from dead works by the blood of christ that has its own interpretational challenges of course what does it mean to have my conscience cleansed from dead works
2331912 what did the cleansing here faith their hearts were cleansed
2331913 so to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to harass me to keep me from becoming conceited three times i pleaded with the lord about this that it should leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may rest upon me for the sake of christ then i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when i am weak then i am strong
2331914 the end that paul wanted was relief from the thorn and he simply assumed that the means would be the thorns removal but god granted the ends by another means he gave relief from the thorn not by removing it but by adding more grace sufficient grace the lord promised paul that in the distress caused by this messenger from satan he would always find that divine grace afforded him a sufficient supply to enable him to bear up as a christian
2331915 the lords reply is in the perfect tense he said to me and what he said continues to hold good moreover the content of his words to paul is in the present tense his grace is sufficient present tense and his power is being made perfect present tense the stake thorn remains and paul continues to be buffeted but the lords reply stands his grace is sufficient his power is being made perfect in the unremoved weakness of the stake thorn
2331916 paul is no stoic who sees the thorn as an opportunity for self mastery and endurance nor is he a theological masochist who glorifies suffering itself when suffering hits paul prays for deliverance
2331917 to whom did paul pray for healing from the thorn god the father or god the son
2331918 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
2331919 only a morbid fanatic can take pleasure in the sufferings he inflicts upon himself only an insensitive fool can take pleasure in the sufferings that are the consequences of his folly and only a convinced christian can take pleasure in sufferings endured for christs sake for he alone has been initiated into the divine secret that it is only when he is weak having thrown himself unreservedly in penitence and humility upon the never failing mercies of god that he is strong with a strength not his own but belonging to the lord of all power and might
2331920 when the power of christ pitched its tent over paul there was not only divine empowering for life and service but also divine protection as a tent protects its inhabitants
2331921 an allusion not to pauls own ability to cope with adversity by harnessing all his personal resources but to his experience of christs power sometimes in delivering him from adversity sometimes in granting him strength to endure hardship but always in equipping him for effective service
2331922 the deepest need that you and i have in weakness and adversity is not quick relief but the well grounded confidence that what is happening to us is part of the greatest purpose in the universe the glorification of the grace and power of his son the grace and power that bore him to the cross and kept him there until the work of love was done thats what god is building into our lives that is the meaning of weakness insults hardships persecution and calamity
2331923 in every condition in sickness in health in povertys vale or abounding in wealth at home and abroad on the land on the sea as thy days may demand shall thy strength ever be fear not i am with thee o be not dismayed for i am thy god and will still give thee aid ill strengthen thee help thee and cause thee to stand upheld by my righteous omnipotent hand when through the deep waters i call thee to go the rivers of woe shall not overflow for i will be with thee thy troubles to bless and sanctify to thee they deepest distress when through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie my grace all sufficient shall be thy supply the flame shall not hurt thee i only design thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine
2331924 after christmas we started to hear a lot of the retailers reporting that they were struggling the high street shops franchises and local businesses was issuing profit warnings and we were getting a lot of the surplus stock in the auction house so we were never busier

2331927 sit down before you meet the journalist and bullet point the messages you want to get across
2331928 you might be taken off message because the journalist will ask questions that you might not want to concentrate on but the journalist wants a frank and broad account of what theyre covering so you have to pay due attention to that
2331929 its a disaster to pick up the phone and talk off the cuff think about what you are going to say

2331953 most of the travel industry is yet to realise that when targeting the gay travel market effectively one size rarely fits all
2331954 gays and lesbians are a very diverse group and within the overall market there are many different identifiable segments of gay and lesbian travellers
2331955 out now has identified important lucrative gay travel cluster segments
2331956 we are looking forward to presenting our findings and strategic implications of our work on how to maximise travel revenues and effectively understand how to market to these gay travel segments at wtm you would not expect a generation y traveller to share the interests of a retiree or a honeymooner in the mainstream market and nor should you when it comes to gay and lesbian travellers
2331957 there is not a single gay market there are many sub market segments our job as market specialists is to help the industry understand which of these segments make the most commercial sense to develop and to devise and implement strategies that increase revenues by targeting gay travellers
2331958 the gay and lesbian travel segment continues to grow and evolve within the travel industry wtm continually provides new insight into this rising market and now with more regions and countries officially recognising gay and lesbian partnerships the honeymoon and gay travel potential will be key for the industry to understand and capitalise on
2331959 its wrong to react to a short term change to potential for returns by exposing a client to more risk than they necessarily feel comfortable with under other circumstances

2331964 but in the interim youve got to say wales 2007 france 2008 do we really want to insult the audience again
2331965 in the end they werent needed but theres a principle here we have the phoenix coached by the national coach not prepared to release players for the olympic games yet tony lochhead has gone off for a trial at middlesbrough
2331966 there would have been a huge furore if that had happened overseas if i was head of new zealand soccer i would have had massive reservations about my head coach of the national team not releasing his club players to go play at a tournament like the olympics
2331967 that just staggers me some of the things ive been hearing have been horrendous i think deep down 99 per cent of people involved in new zealand soccer think the same thing but people are a bit too politically correct to say so
2331968 the talents there that was obvious last night against china but all these guys are complete amateurs who do their jobs and go to university and theyre playing against ronaldinho and brazil on sunday

2331974 i was going to reply in the comments but decided this deserved its very own response
2331975 i use them when im actually coming out of the pocket
2331976 we felt that what we were doing was very press worthy and that there were a lot of stories to be told around our business
2331977 we got in touch with marci alboher journalist for the new york times and she was polite and said that if we were of interest to her she would be in touch
2331978 for five months we stayed on her radar and invited her to events or kept her updated on what we were doing we were conscious that we didnt want to come across as too pushy but its a fine line
2331979 we had gone through this roller coaster of being excited being let down and then everything being back on again
2331980 we felt it reflected our business well and we were flattered by her nice comments and our members comments too so we felt touched by that
2331981 we have met a tremendous amount of women and had a lot of interest from people who want to do something similar thats been a little tricky because we have extension plans and although we are very collaborative sometimes we cant because we cant give away our business model
2331982 we have had to change some of our practices so now we have a more intense screening process for new members and ask more questions when we take inquires or have people come meet with us
2331983 he asked me why women are different than men well i dont really feel qualified to answer that so i thought how can i answer this question without looking stupid but at the same time not getting into a conversation thats not interesting
2331984 i havent stopped since the article was published so this is a really exciting and positive time for us
2331985 persevere and youll get featured in the lazy liberal msm
2331986 it still surprises me that respectable agencies can spend small fortunes on sites with no regard for seo for example they often rely on rather than cleverly using flash and somehow these sites get approved by marketing departments
2331987 it is the job of everyone involved in building a website to help maximize the companys profits but that cant be done if you are ignoring search engine traffic which is becoming the biggest source of sales for many markets nevertheless it still happens time after time
2331988 recently ive seen some of the most respected seo agencies in this country openly talk about using programs to submit comments on search engines its easy to get software for this and its pure spam
2331989 as everyone running a website with comments is reminded each time they have to delete spam comments
2331990 its like selling a second hand car that you cant see and might not be delivered for a year
2331991 some businesses out there are only just getting used to being on the internet doing online marketing and pr and then along comes seo and how do they make that judgment on which seo agency to use its very hard
2331992 often they will see a company with a nice website and they may be inclined to trust them im sure they are right sometimes and of course there are lots of poor smaller outfits but to me its more shocking when respectable looking companies dont deliver
2331993 you then need to get whoever you have approached to prove it prove what theyve done even when its a personal reference
2331994 it might seem really good but really its meaningless what phrases what traffic will it bring they can be quite popular phrases but they might not bring that much
2331995 any reasonable sized site is interested in hundreds of thousands of keywords
2331996 do you have an appreciation of the difference between strategy and tactics
2331997 id be wanting them to go through a process of coming up with a strategy first and then an accompanying plan of action show me the strategy how are you going to get there and whats the plan of action
2331998 id also want a bespoke plan for my website if they say heres our list of actions which hasnt been adjusted for your site then thats probably good for their systems but its not considering you and your particular situation and every site is different
2331999 so its not rankings not traffic and not even sales although they are useful metrics and can help measure progress and success they are not the end in itself

2332015 we love our daughter a lot and are trying to do the right thing its a hard decision to sign her to social welfare child youth and family joint custody its hard to do that to your own kid but im hoping this is going to break the cycle and shell know the consequences for her running away
2332016 very sorry she loves us and wants to come home
2332017 its about helping the twin cities put on a better face i get to brag about it and its also an opportunity to serve
2332018 i went myself so that i wouldnt have to pay one of my guys to do the work
2332019 i hired kevin as the part time executive director of our parent organization when i was president of the kinship board
2332020 he supports our affiliates with training administration board development website resources troubleshooting and hes an engaging speaker our volunteers like him
2332021 but i put some money in the bank from the sale of previous businesses and im finally making a living in this business
2332022 hes sincere he gave volunteers a good overview of customer service how to be good listeners how to deal with challenging situations and to be appreciative these volunteers are our ambassadors
2332023 its a fact of life for the police officer working today
2332024 the fact it happened in court shows the stark reality of a police officers duties
2332025 all refunds are expected to be issued shortly following the close of the financing round
2332026 we must balance our financial health with our modification schedules over the next few months
2332027 were creating chances weve got a lot of variety so i think weve definitely shown enough
2332028 we probably didnt have as many chances against melbourne as we did against the mariners but we certainly had enough to win it
2332029 weve still gone through the pre season unbeaten outside ofa penalty shootout and thats decent
2332030 id struggle to find a better centre half in the league really
2332031 i think jon has settled in really well and obviously picking up the leadership role as well
2332032 phoenix are going to be a difficult team to beat in wellington and certainly no pushover the team is well drilled
2332033 you cant love everything about everyone but there must be something there the key is to find that one small slice of overlap between you and them and focus intensely on that overlap ignoring everything else
2332034 if we knew the answer to that wed be pretty wealthy men
2332035 the crux of it is that youve got 16 people ramming together quite fast and theres only a very small point on the shoulder that you can hit to get it right
2332036 i think there was a study done a few years ago about how much pressure there is upon impact and its something like two tonnes so if you dont get it right or somebodys out of alignment or theres a missed bind thats why it goes down
2332037 one of the problems weve got to is the education of referees around who is at fault there are times when a player is at fault but by and large they dont choose to pull them down
2332038 the old forwards get a bad rap when it comes to the brains point of view but it takes a lot to understand whats going on and even when you understand whats going on you cant get it right all the time
2332039 a referee only has to change his engagement call by half a second and it makes a difference its a difficult one and i understand why people get frustrated but a scrum is one of those things that spectators are really supportive of if its dominant
2332040 there is a bit of that but it goes back to your argument about spectators not liking it youre not going to please people all the time so its a really difficult argument
2332041 the whole idea of a scrum is to re start play and make it a contest to win a ball thats not yours just like in a lineout the whole idea of rugby is that its a battle and you dont want to get beaten so why take things away from guys that are part of a contest
2332042 somthing like faith the first year of elegy in one writers life
2332043 the book actually says the same thing me and darren rowse emphasize a couple of times that this is not a get rich quick scheme and although theres money dont think pack in the day job and ill make a bigger income from blogging there is money to make but its hard work and you have to choose the right battle
2332044 for darren he made money out of things like adsense and chitika a blog advertising company which rowse claims has made him more than 250 000
2332045 blogging is a tactic and a route to an audience its not a business in itself we would rather think of it as focussing on your own audience and finding ways of pleasing them and paying your bills too
2332046 you have to ask yourself what have i added thats new if all youre doing is adding content or editorial and not commenting on it then whats the point of reading your blog you might as well just go to the original source of the link
2332047 keyword research is great for locating a niche market and is also really important for working out if a niche has legs if nobody is interested in the niche then youve gone too narrow and if theres too many people in the niche then youve gone too wide
2332048 the niche could be 32 to 40 year old professional women or a demographic a topic or even an attitude you have to find a way to connect the audience and keyword research will tell you not only what niche to go for but what topics to write for that niche
2332049 i dont do keyword research for my own blog but i do do a lot of it for clients the funny thing with my own personal blog is that i want to keep talking to my small but engaged audience its not about traffic but people who really want to hear from me and buy my services id rather have 10 people that really want to hear from me than a million that i kind of miss
2332050 i think corporate blogs can be useful but i have advised companies in the past not to do it
2332051 they are not going to be able to blog very well but they will be able to get the benefits of wordpress content management system they will get the benefit of having articles and getting links to those articles but there has to be the right culture to successfully blog and get an audience
2332052 a lot of businesses look at blogging as a silver bullet but a good company blog is a symptom rather than a cause i think its a shame that companies think we need a blog but dont really get what that means and the commitment that it brings
2332053 i always say that the comments area is like your home and its your house your rules
2332054 i see comments as being vital because of the engagement aspect
2332055 if you really take care of what you write then other peoples opinions are just other peoples opinions your reputation will grow from it rather than be damaged
2332056 comments can be good for search engine rankings too but i have a feeling that google downplays the comments section because it attracts so much spam
2332057 content is king but without an army guarding him hes just a man in a funny hat
2332058 you need good quality traffic and that comes from fellow bloggers i link to somebody else whos writing about online marketing or blogging and send people who are interested in that subject to them because i get the same in return
2332059 in terms of converting to regular readers then links from other bloggers is the way to go
2332060 to get on to their radar you have to comment and email them and get some sort of relationship going or use a service like twitter to get into conversation
2332061 the main thing is to have content that is linkable and things like top tens always seem to work well the other thing id say is that formatting is important too so when you have a picture bullet points or quotes it makes it more skimmable dense blocks of text are off putting and people wont bother reading it
2332062 content is king but just a funny guy in a hat without an army guarding him
2332063 the fact is iraq has a free and independent media
2332064 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
2332065 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
2332066 under saddams regime we had limited salaries but we had security and decent services now we have decent incomes but we lose it all to water propane groceries fuel we save nothing
2332067 this government gives with the right hand and takes away with the left
2332068 i just got to the point and told him dont waste my time
2332069 he told me i paid him and then went on with my day im practical
2332070 if you spend a few weeks in beijing your blood might become thicker and sticky and then when you fly 12 hours back to the u s that further increases your risk if clots migrate into the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism that can kill you
2332071 oh i meant to copy the files not the entire directory crap
2332072 the 80s were all about drugs alcohol and casual sex and kate evans deftly conveys the uncertainty of the era as her feisty norma rogers leaves a sheltered home life and dives headfirst into a series of hedonistic adventures at college including falling in love with chuck who just doesnt seem to be that in to her the clever dialogue unexpected twists and a meticulous sense of time and place evoke the immediacy of memoir funny poignant and ultimately a testament to lasting friendship for the may queen is a trip back to the not so distant past without the hangover
2332073 the special fee and new team levy only lasted for several years but the special fee loading was something we did not need in the situation
2332074 it will probably be a bridge too far but im trying everything because i know womens basketball in new zealand needs this and it would be too good an opportunity to lose
2332075 we are just waiting to hear from basketball new zealand whether they have been able to get another base for the team but we only have a matter of days
2332076 the so called prayer journal is not in gws writing although im not sure its actually a forgery the manuscript dealer burk i think who first sold it when it came to light in the 19th century printed a facsimile edition in which he admits that the smithsonian rejected it as a non gw document but it did have washington family provenance so he said thus it apparently was a descendants johnsons version is taken from burk the prayers are based on the english prayer book
2332077 hes a lost person i suppose its the way hes been brought up theres a lot of things that have contributed to his personality
2332078 without any parents around theyre the only people that carry the impact of whats happening with their brother that sister of his has been working so hard to try and get him on track
2332079 i was so sad when it happened when i heard it in the morning news i felt for the police officer
2332080 and after that all our friends are coming back to our place to watch the olympic games
2332081 we are trying to be proactive and limit alcohol fuelled incidents that happen in identified problem areas
2332082 there have not been a great number of instances when we up the ante in november that could change
2332083 we use it for intersection control wherever there could be conflict between pedestrians and cars
2332084 we were still fundraising the final 6000 for the original fare the thought of another two years fundraising is really too much
2332085 i said im the executive director of the agency i can vouch for them right now but no
2332086 we were desperate at that point so i put it all on my credit card i will never ever fly qantas again
2332087 i was livid they just didnt want us on the plane with the dogs it was pitiful
2332088 the passenger must carry and present a recognised service dog id card or documentation at the time of check in
2332089 in this case although qantas operated the flight the passengers travelled as customers of american airlines therefore american airlines has responsibility for booking ticketing and providing passengers with information
2332090 it is very heavy snowflakes but before that it was quite flaky
2332091 he joe just stood in the door and said i need your help ive killed david hes dead he knew exactly what he was saying and he wanted an alibi
2332092 from that alone i thought it was worth putting it in front of a jury
2332093 it was apparent that what happened that night happened pretty close to the car i dont know if the car was the scene of the murder
2332094 there was never any suggestion he was out of his brothers company
2332095 in 1990 i reviewed this file and advised the police there was insufficient evidence at that time to proceed i wont say who the suspect is or who we were looking at
2332096 i am bound by confidentiality to my client which is the police i could not comment on that
2332097 davids death had nothing to do with me he was a bully a thug and if he got killed by being donged over the head by somebody it wasnt by me
2332098 we get in early at the first domestic and give the guy a card
2332099 it tells them there is help available its not about being punitive but telling them its ok to ask for help
2332100 no one is out to get anyone we just want them to make a change
2332101 the feedback from frontline officers is the guys are saying good something for me which is good
2332102 motivating prisoners to make changes to their lives is critical in reducing reoffending
2332103 these activities address idleness in prison which is important because bored prisoners are far more likely to be disruptive and troublesome for our staff
2332104 i wouldnt see it as a priority and i certainly wouldnt be putting my money there but the more inmates who are occupied the safer the prison is
2332105 that this made me laugh out loud is indicative of degree of pms i think
2332106 a lot of people are interested in china right now because of the olympics and they know about the chinese food right now and then we get more business so that helps business a lot
2332107 they see that interest and that type of stuff on tv and they can come here to get a taste of that
2332108 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when you received your partys nomination
2332109 the phenom 300 program is steadily moving forward the first and the second aircraft are key pieces for the certification campaign

2332113 the cirrus vision jets will bolster our successful business model
2332114 by extending the scope of satsairs air cab service beyond its traditional range and will enable our customers to extend the reach of their businesses in a timely efficient manner
2332115 the cirrus vision will meet the additional demands of the personal air travel market and will fit our business model perfectly
2332116 the day will come when these people will have to answer for their crimes to this country
2332117 i have been closely involved with common purpose for more than 10 years and this is simply not the case
2332118 these appear to have the aim of causing disruption and harassment to common purpose as a third party and consequently to the public authority itself
2332119 it puts you in this perpetual loop so your only options are to kill your browser session or be browbeaten into installing it
2332120 and 4 more of my users clicked on the links in these emails today even though they 1 never signed up for cnn emails 2 saw that the from address was bogus and 3 saw that the links were to a third party site
2332121 its the customers that care who actually have a huge impact on your business if no one cares youve got trouble goal one is getting people to care goal two is listening to them
2332122 hurrah at last someone who has grasped the true problems of seo with both hands
2332123 i am a web designer who plans and builds my websites with seo in mind from day one as a matter of fact i sometimes plan longer than build i follow most of these guidelines to the letter and have very high rankings on most of the sites i build for their appropriate keyword requirements
2332124 i could add quite a few things to it that are common mistakes including allowing duplicate content issues through poor url structure or failure to canonnicalise sic keyword stuffing or other suspicious on page keyword usage like hidden text and failure to write search engine friendly semantically marked up code
2332125 but most important of all is pick the right keywords which means identifying keywords that people are actually using to search so perhaps number 2 on the list might be amended to stress this bit if you get this bit wrong everything else you do is a waste of time
2332126 in item 1 on your list on the big picture
2332127 how can a retail store or service business or any business with under 20 employees which accounts for 90 of all us businesses afford a strategy that includes thousands of page so content and keywords
2332128 the advice is solid for larger firms but make sure that you dont reference
2332129 serve to feed the increasing distrust of the seo industry
2332130 there are some good and valid points being made in this article but the sweeping statements devalue the overall piece in my opinion
2332131 i have to call it how i see it and i see people trusting seo companies that are delivering poor service
2332132 i think youre right about articles like this being full of
2332133 this is it no stone is unturned absolutely must read article for everyone interested in seo
2332134 by adopting mark nunneys seo experties sic i am seeing that my alexa ranking is going to be better day by day and also getting organic traffic from google yahoo amp msn

2332139 economic growth is likely to be substantially weaker than the first quarter
2332140 certainly its going to have a huge potential economic impact to the city
2332141 our case is an attempt to end the insult that our island is suffering both in greece and internationally
2332142 claiming that the word insults their history is ridiculous it is a word that has evolved harmlessly from history and mythology
2332143 debbie gibson is pregnant with my two headed love child
2332144 man dont get started on that one or youll be totally stuck
2332145 can be impermissibly vague for either of two reasons first if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits second if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
2332146 see everything you can possibly see in 10 days thing
2332147 all other organizations including not profit organizations and government agencies
2332148 when sentient and jetdirect first came together we established a fully integrated personal air travel company offering jet cards charter and complete aircraft management services
2332149 we built a structure that provided optimal air safety and ensured full regulatory compliance
2332150 fully integrated organization did not effectively support the differing business requirements of the products
2332151 what about the role of stereotype in helping us to decide who is smart and who is dumb
2332152 wir wissen noch nicht ob wir caprica als backdoor piloten senden werden wir werden uns das mal anschauen und eventuell direkt die serie bestellen

2332162 i think the public would be horrified at times at times we struggle to put two cars out in one shift were lucky if we ever get three
2332163 we keep treading water when we dont have homicides but as soon as we have homicides or other serious crime major investigations turn to custard
2332164 we just need extra staff we always have our district has never been staffed properly
2332165 to do the basics like checking registration numbers and following up on descriptions of offenders
2332166 many churches do not have a vision for church planting and have very little insight into what a church planter looks like other churches that are interested in church planting have an intuitive sense of a church planter prospect but have not articulated it and thus may not recognize a man that would make a great church planter our church leaders should be able to spot a church planter and then send him to plant as soon as he is ready
2332167 experience has taught me that if you want to change something you do want to go a little bit slow
2332168 the fact is that believing in human rights does not make them real in our communities
2332169 knowledge of the contents of the universal declaration will hardly advance their conditions

2332171 if we want to be christians we must show something of christs breadth of sympathy by acting responsibly by grasping our hour by facing danger like free men by displaying a real sympathy which springs not from fear but from the liberating and redeeming love of all who suffer

2332182 renting out a home especially at the high end of the market is not the windfall it may seem a 1 million home may only fetch 2 500 per month in rent payments not nearly enough to cover a 6 000 monthly mortgage payment mullane said

2332205 mi5 and mi6 could be forced to share their intelligence with the rest of europe under new proposals from the eu under the plans seen by the daily telegraph all countries would feed secret information into a central intelligence unit so that any member state can use it but the proposals risk hard won intelligence gathered by british agents being leaked by less scrupulous security services particularly in the former communist states of eastern europe although the government has contributed to the proposals being drawn up britains security services are likely to put up stiff opposition to the plans

2332221 the fire started from a refrigerator electrical fault that smouldered for several hours before exploding and blowing out all windows and the garage door

2332225 australia is headed for a once in 100 year real estate slump i have never seen the convergence of so many negatives
2332226 stunning lovely convenient start me off anywhere you like buyers
2332227 it may take a few more months before people accept a new level of pricing buyers are also holding off to see how low the market will go
2332228 there developed this perception that the property market was bullet proof and you always get these double digit returns
2332229 you had dr alan bollard standing up three years ago and telling new zealanders if you keep investing in property im going to put up interest rates until it really hurts but those warnings were largely ignored so the bigger the party the bigger the chance of a hangover
2332230 when our generation was young we would start out with a very modest house in not the best area and expect to trade our way up but the younger couples today want their first home to be as nice as their parents or even nicer
2332231 they will really go to the limit to have what they think they should have
2332232 the banks are saying no you cant borrow any more against your house some are having to face living only on their wages for the first time
2332233 the development ratios are a million miles out of line
2332234 people are having to pay 200 000 300 000 for lots when they should be paying no more than 30 000 to 50 000 we should not be spending any more than 20 of the total house price on the land
2332235 people say house prices seldom actually fall but weve just been through the biggest property boom in history so why do you think historical averages are going to be any guide on the downside
2332236 theyre saying unemployment could double in the next year or so once you get unemployment coupled with high interest rates then youll find that housing goes down quite quickly
2332237 im not competitive with them actresses i root for all of them because we definitely dont have equality with men in this business there are a lot more men making a lot more money and headlining movies than women and the more of us who can come up and do that the better i want my friends to produce direct act write all of it
2332238 i think being competitive defeats the whole female movement i want to be encouraging to my girlfriends totally

2332242 mogelijk de beste manier voor de vlamingen om de belgische staat het voetje te lichten is om die massaal te negeren
2332243 moeten niet formeel hun onafhankelijkheid uitroepen het enige wat ze in dit stadium moeten doen is de geldstroom naar walloni stoppen en de belgische regering behandelen met de minachting en verachting die ze verdient

2332245 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome
2332246 wij hebben het recht niet om mea culpa te blijven slaan voor onze zogezegde onverdraagzaamheid als wij systematisch met onverdraagzaamheid worden geconfronteerd
2332247 maar ja dan heb je mensen als jos geysels groen die blijven volhouden dat het cordon gebaseerd is op een ethische afweging en dat er dus niet aan mag getornd worden terwijl diezelfde geysels al jarenlang weigert problemen bespreekbaar te maken het probleem met politici als geysels is dat ze geen gesprek aangaan met de bewoners van achterstandswijken die op het vlaams blok stemmen dat soort politici is eenvoudig niet ge nteresseerd in die meningen en onderbuikgevoelens die hen niet aanstaan

2332249 de vraag is of de islam wel in overeenstemming te brengen is met de liberale democratie en de vrijheid de verdraagzaamheid de verscheidenheid en het tegensprekelijk debat zonder dewelke geen open samenleving mogelijk is is de zaak rushdie niet het ultieme bewijs van de onmogelijkheid van de islam zich in te passen in onze samenleving toont zij niet aan dat de islam in wezen een intolerante en totalitaire ideologie is die botst met de culturele morele en juridische voorschriften die gelden in een open en democratische samenleving
2332250 ziehier wat ik u vraag te doen geloof niet dat er weerstand moet geboden worden aan de bezetter aanvaard eerder het feit van zijn overwinning en probeer er lessen uit te trekken voor de werkende klassen en voor het socialisme is deze ineenstorting van een vermolmde wereld verre van een ramp te zijn een bevrijding de weg ligt open voor de twee doelstellingen die de verzuchtingen van het volk samenvatten de europese vrede en de sociale rechtvaardigheid

2332259 als ik heel veel bid komen papa en mama misschien wel weer bij elkaar
2332260 ik kwam uit school en ik zag de dominee op de bank zitten ik dacht eerst dat hij gewoon op bezoek kwam maar toen mijn vader me kwam halen had ik het door eerst wilde ik het niet maar ik ben uiteindelijk huilend naar binnengegaan omdat ik wist wat er ging komen de dominee heeft toen alles verteld ik weet nog dat ik het niet wilde horen
2332261 mijn vertrouwen was weg sindsdien ben ik gaan stotteren dromen en bedplassen daarnaast heb ik heel veel moeite gehad met het maken van beslissingen ook op school ben ik jarenlang gepest want ik was minder weerbaar door alles wat er gebeurd was een scheiding maakt je erg onzeker
2332262 we willen de maatschappij wijzen op de schadelijke gevolgen van echtscheiding zowel emotioneel als economisch
2332263 wel hoor ik van scheidende ouders vaak argumenten die ge nt zijn op zelfontplooiing ik wil mensen motiveren om het samen op te lossen want het lijkt wel of dat argument naar de achtergrond verdwenen is
2332264 kinderen worden in een nest geboren waarvan ze denken dat het voor altijd is als dat nest dan letterlijk uit elkaar valt zijn ze totaal in de war en stort hun wereld en toekomstbeeld in ze zijn hun nest kwijt verder hebben ze vaak te maken met loyaliteitsproblemen ze hebben het gevoel dat ze moeten kiezen tussen de ouders en dat willen en kunnen ze niet of de ene ouder heeft rare praatjes over de andere ouder of andersom
2332265 de vader wordt dan een soort leuke oom met wie je alleen maar leuke dingen doet dat is voor het kind niet goed en heeft niets met opvoeding en continu teit te maken bovendien wordt het vaderschap uitgehold
2332266 het kind woont bijvoorbeeld de ene week bij de moeder en de andere week bij de vader zodat beide ouders het kind kunnen opvoeden en bijvoorbeeld de vader niet die leuke oom wordt
2332267 ouders hebben misschien een beetje in de gaten dat het wat doet met een kind maar ik denk niet dat ze ten diepste beseffen wat voor schadelijke en ingrijpende gevolgen een scheiding heeft voor een kind
2332268 ik geloof in de geestelijke effecten van scheiden en ik geloof ook dat dat kan doorwerken van generatie op generatie
2332269 een scheiding is nooit zijn plan geweest want zoiets raakt hele generaties en ik geloof dat god het scheiden haat omdat het de mens kapot maakt en zijn tegenstander grond geeft om levens te vernielen
2332270 ik heb het een plaats kunnen geven en het is veilig op dat punt heeft god mijn emoties en gevoelens genezen ik ben ook niet meer bang dat mijn huwelijk op een scheiding zal uitlopen

2332276 sometimes its big projects like an old house other times its a small thing
2332277 i didnt know a whole lot about the cemetery so it was kind of a learn as you go type of thing
2332278 this one did face a low i guess thats why they asked me to come in and rejuvenate it i have a lot of ideas and connections with people who can help me rather than paying out of pocket our reserves are limited and the state watches our finances very closely
2332279 its nice to know where your family and relatives are buried and being able to make sure its being kept up well

2332287 recent news stories suggesting the government has put forward a proposal on stamp duty are simply wrong
2332288 as has been said on many previous occasions the government has made clear that there are a number of options we will need to consider to help businesses and people get through what is undoubtedly a difficult time
2332289 youve just been on my mind this last while and i called to tell you i have been praying for you
2332290 in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express
2332291 this is a victory for consumers because ethanol lowers gas prices reduces air pollution and reduces our dependence on expensive foreign oil
2332292 every independent study has confirmed that using corn to make this cheap clean american made fuel has no significant impact on food prices
2332293 we believe the tradeoff between the benefits of the rfs to the cost of gasoline to american homeowners outweigh any small increase in food costs
2332294 and shows that the bad press about ethanol has been just a lot of hyperbole
2332295 some of the panic has subsided that panic has been fueled by the mainstream media who jumped on the anti ethanol bandwagon
2332296 the fight is not over but this is a significant victory
2332297 this ruling proves that the truth about ethanol prevails when scrutinized against hard numbers and economics ethanol is a benefit not impairment to the nations economy fuel prices are lower because ethanol is included in the u s fuel supply
2332298 renewable biofuels are one of the most important tools we have to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
2332299 epas decision to deny this waiver indicates that we are going to stay the course in pursing a national strategy of increasing production and use of domestic renewable biofuels it also sends a strong signal to encourage investment in renewable sources of energy
2332300 i commend epa for denying this waiver and indicating that our country will continue to maintain a strong commitment to renewable energy american agriculture associated industries and rural communities in iowa and around the country stand ready to meet the challenges to produce the biofuels food feed and fiber that are needed
2332301 weve disagreed with the reasons behind the governors request all along
2332302 i dont think its a surprise to anyone that higher oil costs are the primary culprit behind higher food costs
2332303 texas farm bureau strongly supports the epas decision to continue using alternative fuel sources such as ethanol this strategy will lessen our dependence on foreign oil
2332304 texans cant stand another 30 to 40 cent per gallon jump at the gas pump
2332305 that is about the amount economists estimate as the positive impact ethanol has on fuel prices we need policy that lowers not adds to the price of energy
2332306 to be perfectly clear agriculture has a leading role to play in lessening our nations dependency on foreign oil however our renewable fuels policy should not be driven by government mandates that are not sustainable but rather by consumer preference and choice
2332307 hopefully this will be a wake up call to our federal government to promote future policies that ensure the sustainability of both our energy and food security in the long and short term as we develop these sound policies we must resist the urge to regulate ourselves out of free market solutions our government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers
2332308 texas cattle feeders association appreciates governor rick perrys efforts on behalf of the livestock industry which brought national attention to the challenges u
2332309 we must also remember that the rfs mandate for corn based ethanol will increase from 9 billion gallons this year to 11
2332310 the governments policy still favors one industry over another by giving ethanol producers a competitive advantage over cattlemen in corn purchases cattle feeders nationwide have incurred a record of approximately 1 5 billion in losses between january and june of 2008
2332311 even with rfs standards in place the price of corn has dropped during the past few weeks
2332312 this proves there are many other factors affecting supply and demand for this important commodity
2332313 were pleased that the epa did not turn its back on the promise of renewable fuels
2332314 in addition to strengthening the first generation biofuels industry the rfs plays a crucial role in fostering the continued development of second and third generation biofuels including cellulosic ethanol biomass based biodiesel and other advanced biofuels
2332315 ensures that consumers will continue to benefit from an expanding supply of domestically produced renewable fuel which is helping to lower gas prices
2332316 people are justifiably focused on pocketbook concerns in todays economy ethanol is one of the few things helping families save money
2332317 epa determined that evidence indicates that even if the rfs mandate were to have an impact on the economy during the 2008 2009 corn marketing year it would not be of a nature or magnitude that could be characterized as severe
2332318 i went and asked the other motw guys if theyd be interested in participating in this too and the response was very positive
2332319 the head of the international olympic committee jacques rogge has praised beijings
2332320 levels of particulate matter pm10 at 191 micrograms per cubic metre this far exceeds the who target of 50 micrograms cubic metre and also exceeds the who target for developing countries of 150 micrograms cubic metre
2332321 they would be disappointed about the loss as much as the fans
2332322 theyll be looking to make amends we know were coming up against a committed team and theyre battling to stay with the eight
2332323 it was going to be a tough match whoever we brought over here
2332324 were now just going to have work extra hard if were to win
2332325 when you havent played for six months you probably have the nerves a little bit more for wade its about getting out there and playing well and hoping the knee holds up okay
2332326 myself and peter wallace because ive come in and out of the team wed never really had a chance to gel
2332327 mindy is a big fan of mad men and she knew that i was a big fan of the office
2332328 so we mused about finding some way to get me over there
2332329 oh so youre sorry that you just smashed out my windshield and thats supposed to be a sincere apology
2332330 oh well you sleep so much and you were so arrogant and you were so cocky
2332331 no hes dedicated to his physique and hes dedicated and determined to make it better day in and day out
2332332 but it just goes to show that this sides a pretty gutsy side this side seems to be able to do what they have to do to win a game
2332333 there was a few tackles there which i thought he could have blown his whistle but he didnt
2332334 it was just the run of the game how it went i said to him archer theres going to be some things done in the ruck and if our players react to it dont blow a penalty go up and have a look and see whats going on
2332335 its waynes choice not to talk to the media and i support that maybe in the future if he is refereeing a match in new zealand there may be some media
2332336 but not for this match it would serve no point
2332337 i stand by my convictions and if they want to send me to jail for what i believe in then so be it
2332338 the injunction is relatively simple he has a contract with the bulldogs he is one year into a five year deal
2332339 the expectation was always that hed honour that commitment and this ensures that he cant play for anything other than whats in his contract
2332340 it is however a victory for the sanctity of a contract
2332341 its a victory for the commitment that one person makes to another its as simple as that
2332342 orders of court arent like referees telling players to stay onside orders of the court are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them
2332343 he is a player of great talent and my client wishes he would play for them
2332344 we are prepared to continue during the course of an interlocutory argument to pay mr williams as per his payments to date 100 per cent of his contract
2332345 in other words even if he keeps playing rugby in toulon he is going to get a salary from the bulldogs
2332346 at the very least reasonable cause for apprehension that williams does not intend to play for the bulldogs although he has agreed to until 31 october 2012
2332347 the evidence before the court satisfies that williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2332348 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2332349 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities justice robert austin told the parties
2332350 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2332351 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2332352 a realidade que o problema foi trazido para a fam lia pela crian a deficiente e portanto normal que a fam lia sinta um certo ressentimento pela defici ncia mas tamb m verdade que a crian a portadora de defici ncia apenas mais um membro da fam lia e antes de tudo uma crian a caso essa diferencia o n o seja feita o ressentimento que a fam lia sente em rela o defici ncia pode inconscientemente transformar se em rejei o pela crian a
2332353 em muitos aspectos a problem tica da defici ncia reflete a maturidade humana e cultural de uma comunidade h implicitamente uma relatividade cultural que est na base do julgamento que distingue entre deficientes e n o deficientes essa relatividade obscura t nue sutil e confusa procura de alguma forma afastar ou excluir os indesej veis cuja presen a ofende perturba e amea a a ordem social

2332356 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2332357 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2332358 i think she would protect him at all costs she is a selfless partner
2332359 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2332360 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2332361 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2332362 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2332363 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2332364 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2332365 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2332366 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2332367 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2332368 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2332369 what amazes me is that he doesnt see how this action is going to reverberate not only through his marriage now its going to touch his kids forever
2332370 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty

2332374 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
2332375 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
2332376 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2332377 he hath eaten me out of house and home he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his
2332378 find out more information about the cancer thats in me so that we can develop a protocol
2332379 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2332380 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2332381 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2332382 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2332383 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him

2332387 some of the five year olds coming in are very low functioning
2332388 their parents have used p and they have low levels of language theyre talking like two year olds have a low ability to concentrate and very poor behaviour
2332389 i think its going to get worse as we have to manage these children from p families unless theres adequate support offered from the government in the form of social workers in every school or a counsellor
2332390 more principals are talking about five year olds coming in with behavioural problems and a lack of concentration and it is becoming more prevalent
2332391 some of the behaviour and violent tendencies are quite alarming
2332392 a large number of five year olds are lovely but there are more and more coming through who are not
2332393 what that does to the foetus is stimulate receptors and neurons not usually used until after they are born and that encourages nerve cells to commit suicide knocking off brain cells
2332394 people on p forget to eat and take physical care the deterioration of the mother will affect the baby if shes not sleeping or eating
2332395 after babies were born they were much harder babies to live with if you get that and the mother going on p its a pretty spectacularly bad combination shaken baby neglected baby
2332396 they may or may not remember to feed the baby
2332397 alcohol is still the biggest problem in society but p is getting in there its the awful disrupted upbringing that is the biggest factor

2332401 i said im the executive director of the agency i can vouch for them right now but no
2332402 we were desperate at that point so i put it all on my credit card i will never ever fly qantas again
2332403 i was livid they just didnt want us on the plane with the dogs it was pitiful
2332404 the passenger must carry and present a recognised service dog id card or documentation at the time of check in
2332405 in this case although qantas operated the flight the passengers travelled as customers of american airlines therefore american airlines has responsibility for booking ticketing and providing passengers with information
2332406 i would be a really little fish in a great big huge pond
2332407 im not a delegate so aside for going for the parties i really dont have any role there theres plenty to do here
2332408 to do that is a multi month process its a round robin its one of the hardest processes we do in a year
2332409 we may be in the middle of the country but were not middle of the road
2332410 we are prepared for the worst we are not naive
2332411 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2332412 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2332413 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2332414 i am pleased that the state senate approved the property tax cap a bold step that br
2332415 today the new york state senate passed a tax cap bill which sponsors falsely advertise as
2332416 this tax cap proposal is a significant step forward however the other matters we addressed today not the least of which is comprehensive mandate relief must be a vital part of the dialogue if we are to provide significant reform to the real property tax system
2332417 everyone knows that we need a solution to property taxes
2332418 as the working and middle class families of upstate new york continue to be devastated by skyrocketing property taxes the increasingly burdensome cost of day to day living and a lack of sustainable good paying jobs republicans joe robach and jim alesi are participating while on the public dime in a special session of the state senate that has served as nothing more than a political public relations gimmick meant to bolster a fading republican senate majority
2332419 upstate new yorkers need and are looking for relief from the escalating costs of living

2332427 you know for one thing there arent many bands around woodstock and our friends and neighbors just call us the band and thats the way we think of ourselves and then we just dont think a name means anything its gotten out of hand the name thing we dont want to get into a fixed bag like that
2332428 and there is the music from our house john wesley harding comes from bobs house the two houses sure are different
2332429 i was young very very young when i got into music
2332430 my mother was musical and i used to listen to country music a lot then when i was about five i can remember i had a thing for the big bands ive been playing guitar for so long i cant remember when i started but i guess i got into rock just like everybody else
2332431 the only mathematical guitar genius ive ever run into who does not offend my intestinal nervousness with his rear guard sound
2332432 weve played everywhere from molasses texas to timmins canada which is a mining town about 100 miles from the tree line
2332433 was feeling bout half past dead hey mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed he just grinned and shook my hand no was all he said
2332434 i was about 13 and you had to stay up late to get it you have to remember i was in stratford ontario at the time
2332435 my uncles all played in bands and my father had a lot of old instruments around the house i guess i began to play the piano when i was about five
2332436 my father used to find all the hoedown stations on the radio and then i played accordion with a country group when i was twelve
2332437 i used to listen to him a lot when i was a kid
2332438 but i think my influences are more general than specific
2332439 it was called the jungle bush beaters if you can believe it but it was a good group
2332440 i once watched tv for six whole months didnt do anything else thats what happens when you spend your time listening you land up not playing and thats all i really want to do
2332441 actually i always wanted to go to nashville to be a cowboy singer from the time i was five id listened to the grand ole opry the blues and country stations
2332442 but he had heard of us he said you wanna play hollywood bowl so we asked him who else was gonna be on the show just us he said
2332443 they say every man needs protection they say that every man must fall yet i swear i see my reflection somewhere so high above this wall
2332444 because this place where we are woodstock is in the mountains
2332445 footballers might moan about putting in 90 minutes work a week but rock drummers are subjecting themselves to the same workout every night on tour
2332446 we havent thought a great deal about that if it happens tasman is dropped from the air new zealand cup but it would be fair to say there would be two new entries i know nelson bays would be keen to play in the heartland championship to try to win promotion
2332447 in spite of my best efforts im excited about the olympics
2332448 it seems like for the last three months weve had one good finish one 20 something finish due to something going on weve got to get at least two weeks in a row of good performances good finishes to solidify our place
2332449 we really couldnt ask for better tracks that are coming up for us of course we thought we had a good finish going at pocono last week but we had to pit twice a lot of guys made it on one pit stop in the final laps we felt like we let a good finish get away there
2332450 each and every week we are just thinking we are going to take the conservative approach and go out there and get a top 10 because thats what we need to do to make the chase and its not like were getting caught up in wrecks
2332451 were just getting caught up in dumb stuff that happens in once every never its very frustrating because i know performance wise we deserve to be in the chase theres some guys hanging on to chase spots and they run 15th to 20th every week but thats where they finish
2332452 assumir a dislexia e encarar com naturalidade a diferen a
2332453 were preparing now for new hampshire which is the first race in the chase whether were in it or not
2332454 i mean we dont change our effort based on our situation we put our effort in the same every week we have to be situational where we have to understand the situation were in and take advantage of it but that goes every week i think depending on what situation youre in determines a lot about the risks that youre willing to take and those kind of things
2332455 thats the first thing youve got to get done if youre in it the better shape you are with the number of wins the better shot you have kyle busch has jumped out there and won a bunch of races he goes into the chase with a pretty substantial lead over the guy thats in 12th thats a big advantage you want the best of both worlds but number one is to make the thing that has to be what you do first with the races that kyle has won he has a real advantage right now
2332456 once a team gets into the chase its game on then
2332457 i dont think youll win the championship by finishing 15th every week you got to win the championship by getting top fives and leading laps add comment

2332459 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did
2332460 russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2332461 i think i am going to go get a massage and im just gonna go kick it with some of my friends and family enjoy being home
2332462 weve been through a lot together shes been my partner through the whole competition going through being frustrated of not getting a dance that you wanted or certain lifts little things
2332463 every time we would go out to the next level we were getting judged as a couple backstage she would be like were okay right and i would say yes were okay even down to that last moment in a way i would almost ask myself are we okay i kind of had to be strong for both of us its so nerve wrecking you would not even understand it was really hard
2332464 ive only been to texas where i live and la it will be so cool to go to all these different cities

2332473 the president has proposed a number of cuts to conservation local foods and other agricultural programs in the 2009 federal budget that were negotiated over a three year period and delicately crafted in the 2008 farm bill
2332474 we have a very clear message for congress and especially the appropriators stick with the balanced funding in the 2008 farm bill
2332475 conservation programs are historically under funded and it would be a terrible shame to turn the clock back on the environmental gains that these programs provide
2332476 we believe it is critical to send a strong message that conservation and foods programs cannot always be the source of dollars for other programs
2332477 we either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong the amount of work is the same
2332478 on the other hand i could really use more free time less responsibility and the ability to give my husband and the kids more undivided attention

2332609 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2332610 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life or maybe ill end up marrying nick jonas
2332611 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have
2332612 no one can touch me no ones mine im myself i think its sexy to do your own thing
2332613 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life or maybe ill end up marrying nick jonas
2332614 im 37 and shouldnt be acting like x y or z
2332615 i think i want to go with an lcd instead of a plasma
2332616 its just a number your only as old as you feel
2332617 i feel like im only 40 when in reality she was in her 80s
2332618 now maybe other people will take me seriously as ive gained a year of experience
2332619 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2332620 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2332621 terry and chad have both done an outstanding job over the last two months
2332622 not only have they moved the team up two spots in owner points but theyve also helped advance the no 45 program this is a competitive car we need to continue that through the end of the year i had a blast in the tnt sports booth but im ready to get back on the track
2332623 stewart cooper and i only worked together for a handful of races before i stepped into the broadcast booth but he has amazed me with his demeanor and attitude
2332624 for such a young crew chief he carries himself well beyond his years its not easy to work with three different drivers he gave terry and chad cars that were racy and i have confidence that he and i will have a good race this weekend at the glen
2332625 ive always enjoyed road course racing especially at the glen
2332626 i dont know if i would want to do it full time because ive been racing on ovals for 30 years but it does give you a nice break during a long season the glen is just a great race track with a lot of history
2332627 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2332628 watkins glen has always been a so so track for me
2332629 weve had decent runs but dont really have the solid finishes to show for it we had a good test at road atlanta a few weeks ago to prepare for this weekend were taking the same car we took to sonoma and i think the car was pretty good out there we just had some bad luck that day
2332630 its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop you could lose 50 straight races and win one and its like you forget about all that stuff
2332631 its a relief and it feels so good because of how hard it is to win these races for a driver and the whole team and company i think winning races and running up front is as much of a confidence builder that you can have in racing
2332632 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2332633 i learned that its tough to start off with not a lot of road course experience and then have to learn a whole new track on top of that
2332634 i just went out there to learn as much as i could i tried to learn as much about braking and followed other cars to see what they were doing then we had to figure out what to do to get our car faster so there was a lot that went into it during both of those practices on friday at montreal
2332635 im sure that same thing will happen this weekend at watkins glen i know as much about watkins glen as i did going into montreal so all you can do is learn with every lap you take
2332636 i definitely looked for someone to follow at the beginning of practice i followed scott pruett and he absolutely destroyed me all the way around the race track
2332637 but i learned a lot from following scott and i ended up picking up quite a bit after that i think going there a second time is going to make me a lot better and im sure the same will hold true for watkins glen after this weekend
2332638 adversity will bring a team together as much as anything
2332639 a weak team will be beat by adversity but a strong team will be stronger through adversity
2332640 listen to your heart follow your heart have a big heart
2332641 i am looking for some help around 50 people with a brand new project i have been working on this for some time and have made good money already but i need a few people to help me take this further
2332642 i have the tools the hosting and the ways to put this into action
2332643 the initial investment is only 50 bucks but you will earn double that in the first 24 hours there may be more investment later down the line but not that much and only if you want to take things further
2332644 if you are interested pm me and i will give you more details
2332645 i think your problem is not so much with the software being expensive but that you have to buy it all at once to be immediately productive
2332646 i couldnt have agreed more with you on that statement
2332647 but the real point has to be this would you go back i wouldnt and im saying that after 24 years of wintel
2332648 is the same tool inside some of ibms most popular collaboration products such as the recently released lotus notes 8
2332649 british office workers waste up to 120bn pieces of paper every year costing businesses as much as 10 of their turnover
2332650 i just want to be able to keep us in games
2332651 theres still a lot of games to play but the significance is that you dont want to be in a bad position
2332652 were in a pretty good position through all of the stuff that has gone on over the last couple of weeks
2332653 were coming out here to win whether were in contention or not they know that
2332654 i wouldnt say were spoilers we came out and played the game right
2332655 weve got guys that dont care about situations that happen on or off the field
2332656 the doom and gloom that was in here two days ago and we end up with a 4 2 road trip and again were doing fine
2332657 when you get a team thats a little more experienced youre able to understand the situations confront them and move on
2332658 you can see that maturity with our team thats starting to show
2332659 he had his best velocity since ive been here he walked those two guys in the third inning and they scored but he did throw the ball better
2332660 ricky had great at bats sparked our offense big time
2332661 i was real proud of rickie rickie got hot this time of year last year too even though theres a lot of people that get on him because they really dont look beyond the day to day happenings rickies been swinging the bat very well since the all star break
2332662 it was just out of my reach if i had to do it over again id watch it and let brandon field it

2332667 when you are preparing cooked food you have to follow a good recipe and that guarantees good results in raw food preparation a recipe can never guarantee results because the ingredients in raw food are always non stable raw fruits and vegetables vary in size and taste i travelled around and met all the best raw gourmet chefs and asked them how they became such great chefs they all told me the same thing they did not follow a recipe the best way to learn is by making the dishes one sweet one savoury and one pate and you must figure it out through trial and error we have a trick to deal with this we use the balance of five flavours one b and four ss bitter sweet sour spicy and salty when you have finished making your dish you check the colour the quantity and the texture and then you adjust the five flavours in every single sip or bite you have to have all five present bitter sweet sour spicy and salty thats what makes it gourmet and so delicious
2332668 how could we get all of those people making personal pages and others all over the net to point to us and our products

2332694 that means results on the track he must continue to have results
2332695 were not in any hurry to advance scott we will evaluate and graduate him as we go but were in no hurry to make him a full time cup guy
2332696 we are evaluating where aj and scott are we have three very good young race car drivers we should know in the next 30 to 45 days have some conclusion by then about our situation the situation were in is good because these guys are all performing now
2332697 red bull gives us phenomenal support but theres no expectation or enthusiasm to sponsor three cars
2332698 what aj needs to do is continue to perform hes come a long way it would behoove us to work it out because red bull has invested a lot in aj

2332730 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2332731 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2332732 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2332733 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2332734 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2332735 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2332736 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2332737 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2332738 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2332739 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2332740 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2332741 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2332742 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2332743 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2332744 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2332745 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2332746 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2332747 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2332748 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2332749 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2332750 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2332751 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2332752 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2332753 this exhibition reunites a cross section of extraordinary objects from henry wellcomes collection ranging from diagnostic dolls to japanese sex aids and from napoleons toothbrush to george iiis hair
2332754 how the fuck did i manage to bone the one liberal who doesnt believe in abortion
2332755 how did i wind up with the one liberal guy interested in vaginal sex
2332756 gee is it really francis quinn hunter whos the true chosen one man thats almost as unlikely as a virgin birth
2332757 maybe it is who knows were still playing a bit of catch up here i gotta admit this one really snuck up on us our bad
2332758 check into shit like we read about in j school if we have time for it and the lakers are out of town
2332759 how were we to possibly know its like finding out santa claus doesnt exist by the way if that look youre giving me means something about santie claus keep it to yourself buddy i dont want to hear your filthy anti santist lies
2332760 that one were still sure of sure i guess its possible stalin lied if this new concept of public figures lying has any merit which we have yet to determine but theres no way a reporter could himself have been complicit that simply defies logic and the laws of physical reality as we know them
2332761 it just doesnt make any damn sense that i can figure
2332762 he told us he was innocent of the charges he was accused of and yet it seems he wasnt innocent at all how can this be i fear the implications of an entire society in which people tell us the media things that arent factually true
2332763 you shouldnt even be riding in a car with a guy named white
2332764 enroll their children in a public full time day school or a legally qualified private full time day school

2332767 is that a snake in your pants yes as a matter
2332768 said that he did not love her next up on 20 20
2332769 i applaud the efforts of the government in bringing to justice these 11 individuals who are damaging millions of american families unfortunately this case while representing the largest prosecution in american history is only the tip of the iceberg in an ever growing illegal enterprise that is staying one step ahead of the government and the banking and credit industries to steal consumers identities
2332770 the time has come for those that profit in the credit industry both the banks and the major credit bureaus to begin working with consumer advocates to proactively protect american consumers from those who would prey on their identity and financial well being

2332795 we may give up some volume but we believe this trade off is in the companys best economic interests
2332796 no clear answer on how the company can return to growth
2332797 meanwhile the industry continues to move forward without sprint further diminishing the companys relevance in the market

2332801 at the present moment it does not appear that the army will support him they will definitely not make any mistake of opposing the will of the people of pakistan
2332802 it is a very difficult time but at the same time it will be a very historical time if the remainder of the military dictatorship is removed
2332803 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic make up the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2332804 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted
2332805 what you gain by violence can only be held by violence

2332823 the military is supposed to be a nameless faceless entity
2332824 we trust the army because they get the job done
2332825 people are scared that the police will cause you harm so no one calls them
2332826 the fact that the army is fielding complaints that it is investigating that its detaining people on its own all of that is against the law
2332827 theres a perception that the army is our savior however i believe it shouldnt be that way the police should be doing this work
2332828 there are no radicalized peasants among my main collaborators and those who have been encouraging or carrying out farm invasions in the last few days are not justified
2332829 we can not allow fear and terror caused by organized crime to take control of our nation
2332830 this is a democracy they call me a tyrant tyrants govern without laws were making laws and all those laws are for the benefit of the country

2332833 youre afraid of the people and you president hid behind the supreme court
2332834 our understanding is that this encounter stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border

2332935 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2332936 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2332937 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2333070 minneapolis city councilwoman lisa goodman is beginning hearings on the fate of the pedalpub in minneapolis this upcoming monday august 11 at 2 30pm

2333110 control room feature which previously was only available in nuendo its great that its now in cubase and a big plus nuendo does have features that cubase doesnt some of which would likely be helpful but to me none of the things make it worth spending twice as much for it yes nuendo 4 costs twice as much as cubase 4 for me the only thing nuendo has that i want in cubase is track sheets i like having a sheet of paper showing me what tracks there are i have both nuendo 4 and cubase 4 and use nuendo 4 the differences are 1 advanced automation in nuendo not in cubase think high end console automation not typical daw automation 2 up to 192k sample rates actually maybe 384k but im not in front of nuendo at the moment 3 edit mode for scrubbing events clips to video critical for and spotting effects 4 pull up down sample rates 5 extended file import export options i think cubase only supports omf where nuendo supports aaf tlaudio etc 6 network support for multi user configurations not useful for single users outside of that they are the same same midi same editing etc in each cubase 4 is all you need unless doing broadcast where you need to sync to video gear which i think you are or 12 2 surround cubase4 will still sync to video but not with all the options n4 offers scott thats only partially correct as far as significant differences as i noted earlier yes sony 9 pin is unique to nuendo as well as a few other sync offset options but there are other even more commonly needed and equally important points for consideration between the two whether doing work for broadcast or not if you are producing music recording etc cubase 4 is the way to go if you are doing any form of audio for video post sound design etc or even higher end mixing nuendo is the way to go or at least worth considering cubase may still be all you need for mixing the new automation system in nuedno is excellent i just loaded cubase 4 on my comp and so far i could have not picked a better daw for its price range and versatilty last year i was running nuendo 2 hacked version and decided to go ahead and buy the software use to make things happen save your money and go for cubase four nuendo is at retail 1800 from what i know cubase and nuendo used to be pretty darned similar but now since cubase 4 was released they have made an effort to distinguish between them more e g taking some of the more music specific features out of nuendo which as someone mentioned are now only available for nuendo if you buy the special add on pack you cannot post new topics in this forum you cannot reply to topics in this forum you cannot edit your posts in this forum you cannot delete your posts in this forum you cannot vote in polls in this forum pro audio forums read this if you are a new poster for more information on advertising investing merging or any other ideas you may have for this community

2333140 ive never seen such a big facility in my life you get a great feeling walking into that facility knowing that this is where the olympic games are and they did an awesome job building it
2333141 its exciting when you just walk into the pool and you sort of imagine the whole thing jam packed and having it be loud
2333142 if it had continued on it would be an issue
2333143 hugest thing thats happened to leadville since we discovered gold
2333144 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited
2333145 a race like this takes a lot of experience and endurance he has that so i guess hes the odds on favorite

2333152 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2333153 while were early in the process this is excellent news
2333154 marshall university is a wonderful asset in mason county providing job training for high demand fields like nursing this funding would help to enhance marshalls facility and im hopeful to see this funding approved
2333155 there is a real need for quality long term care facilities in our state and this funding can help st josephs hospital meet that need in upshur county
2333156 this is the beginning of a lengthy process but im hopeful to see this funding approved by the full house
2333157 im looking for a smooth start getting all the kids back in
2333158 we were able to get positive feedback on testing scores that have emerged and where we need to move forward from here
2333159 i appreciate the briefings we are getting on the baldridge process and the strategic plan
2333160 its helpful to have that laid out so we can pass that down to our people
2333161 the freshman initiative program at george washington university was our model for the summer program but without the initiative of our teachers especially mary bennett webster wouldnt be improving getting off of the list of schools in need of improvement or gaining overall on test scores the past couple of years
2333162 it gives us an opportunity to bring in all of our campus security and show them what to expect
2333163 when you have teenagers their ideas of what their rights are are completely messed up because of what they have seen on tv and the internet
2333164 they think the only people they have to listen to are their parents so we are exploring some of the issues involved with that type of crowd control and managing large groups of people
2333165 you dont cuss youre not rude you always tell the truth and you never threaten
2333166 the biggest challenge for the security guards is going to be dealing with students that become unruly
2333167 we want to keep our campuses safe for our students and our faculty
2333168 were all kicking off the school year on the same page
2333169 teachers principals district administrators its time for all of us to work together and continue the momentum that has led to such success over the last two years

2333171 because some parents cant even afford haircuts for their children and this helps them start school with confidence
2333172 we want to be at the cutting edge of what alternative schools do nationally
2333173 a message from earth presents an opportunity for the digital natives of today for whom the internet is both a fact of life and an integral part of their lives to reconnect with science and the wider universe in a simple fun and immersive way
2333174 are the two members who couldnt even serve in the guard
2333175 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2333176 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2333177 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2333178 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2333179 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2333180 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2333181 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz
2333182 we will not chase certain types of violations this is one of those situations
2333183 this kind of policy does not give the residents a lot of confidence that police will protect us
2333184 it kind of says were wide open the police cant chase you
2333185 we need to balance the safety of the community against a stolen tv
2333186 if its a safety issue that a car pursuit is dangerous to other traffic and residents then i can understand that
2333187 on the other hand weve had so many burglaries over here when you catch someone id think theyd have some foresight
2333188 its not about people saying i know whats best for you
2333189 if the state certifies me as a promotora i have to speak english
2333190 i have to conform to a system that may or may not reflect that volunteer as well as that professional piece
2333191 if you look hard enough we have promotoras in churches we have promotoras in communities we have promotoras in so many different places
2333192 too many times volunteers are looked upon as free labor

2333195 he asked to sleep on it for a night he doesnt want to be supervised
2333196 no one is accusing him of intentionally maliciously harming the animals
2333197 the animals are the victims here and they dont have a voice
2333198 were passionate about this case we believe the animals were subjected to needless suffering
2333199 for all we know the citizen complaint was rank hearsay and not based on personal knowledge
2333200 because that was the source of our complaint we didnt have probable cause either
2333201 without a permit i would very much doubt you could have that many dogs
2333202 its possible he could be cited under the zoning code
2333203 after a letter back from the ceo saying that he was sorry and embarrassed by the situation and that he was sure he wanted to work with me again and that they were about to have a meeting to figure out how to pay multiple debts that they owed
2333204 i cant quite figure out what good blogging national does
2333205 youve made this day a special day by just your being you theres no person in the whole world like you and i like you just the way you are

2333209 that is the day in 1974 when richard nixon was forced to resign from office for his lawbreaking and surveillance abuses that day illustrates how far we have fallen in this country in less than 35 years as we now not only permit rampant presidential lawbreaking and a limitless surveillance state but have a bipartisan political class that endorses it and even retroactively protects the lawbreakers
2333210 the worst decision sport ever made was to start testing for drugs once they began to catch the cheats all hell broke out and we began to lose the faith
2333211 win at all costs screw everyone else and their morality
2333212 wouldnt the olympics be a lot more fun if they allowed drug users to compete the events would change i know that itd be like hop skip and where the did he go
2333213 the only certainty about doping is that people dont want it the world anti doping agency wada is committed to eliminating epo erythropoietin and there are more than 50 types to eliminate even though it is not dangerous

2333216 aw people can come up with statistics to prove anything kent forfty percent of all people know that
2333217 in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didnt commit these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune if you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire the a team

2333222 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
2333223 this is as tough of a setup as ive ever seen
2333224 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough u s tour event
2333225 its nearly more u s open type than the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
2333226 the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should
2333227 so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
2333228 this has the potential to play as the hardest major
2333229 and thats never the case usually of the four majors if you played your best you could score here
2333230 you look at guys who have not won majors who at my age 38 or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
2333231 i thought this was going to be the downfall of this generation of sprinters
2333232 people have said to me this is boring and yeah it is kind of boring this is supposed to be like boxing youre not supposed to like each other but they have proved me wrong
2333233 its all very businesslike we dont really have that thing where this group doesnt like that group theres really no need to talk a lot
2333234 the girls are very even tempered and smooth i like everybody i dont have anyone where i say really mean things about
2333235 in my generation we had maurice and ato and michael johnson who hated each other and dennis mitchell who everyone hated
2333236 but its good to see track and field has enough problems to get over
2333237 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
2333238 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go

2333243 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
2333244 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
2333245 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
2333246 heavy rain in the tropics is often associated with thunderstorms and the same processes will also apply in the uk particularly in summer where intense downpours are fueled by the additional moisture carried by warm humid air
2333247 one of the most serious challenges that humanity will face in response to climate change is adapting to changes inextreme weather events there is a major concern that heavy rainstorms will become more common and more intense in a warmer climate
2333248 floods can completely devastate areas and peoples livelihoods and so this knowledge could have massive implications on how we plan for our changing climate in the future
2333249 as the tropics warm are seeing an increased frequency in the heaviest rainfall
2333250 implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes may be underestimated
2333251 flash flooding can cause damage to settlements and societies it can contaminate ground water drinking supplies with potential health effects
2333252 the spread of disease can be impacted by heavy rainfall
2333253 very intense rainfall can destroy crops there are also possibilities of enhanced erosion degradation of soil
2333254 the models seem to underestimate the response in extreme rainfall with warming
2333255 so if the air is more moist you get more heavy rainfall
2333256 you can get flash flooding and heavy rainfall can destroy crops
2333257 after floods one often sees clusters of vector borne diseases malaria dengue fever japanese b encephalitis
2333258 rainfall changes remain among the hardest impacts of global warming to predict precisely
2333259 allan and sodens results add fuel to the growing concern from a number of research groups that the extremes of rainfall may increase under global warming

2333272 these rapid changes in oceanic climate are already causing responses in australias tropical marine ecosystems and if present rates continue these will only intensify
2333273 a possible indicator of greater thermal stress in the southern great barrier reef is the evidence from three recent large scale coral bleaching events
2333274 the rapidity and magnitude of warming along australias tropical coastal regions is of great concern for maintenance of the integrity of their diverse tropical ecosystems especially coral reefs
2333275 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
2333276 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
2333277 most mortality relates to the dumping of fishing waste behind the boat this attracts seabirds which can either hit the warp lines or become entangled in the nets
2333278 the impact of this one local fishery has very widespread geographical repercussions
2333279 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable

2333345 our brave veterans have served with courage honor and great skill and our nation owes them and their families more than we can ever repay they protected our backs we must cover theirs when they return
2333346 words are not enough however and that is why i am working hard to bring home every benefit our veterans have earned including improving the health care services we offer our returning heroes
2333347 it is my honor today to present these medals to mary schubert for her husbands brave service to our nation i think it s incumbent upon us as leaders to demonstrate our gratitude through actions and that is why i introduced a bill to help veterans who were exposed to agent orange receive the health care benefits they deserve

2333358 we all want arkansass communities to be as safe as possible
2333359 these funds provide important resources to help local law enforcement officials protect families in flippin and i will continue to fight for these critical priorities
2333360 on a daily basis flippin families depend on critical services only first responders can provide
2333361 these grants are an excellent example of how federal funds can be reinvested into our local communities and give all residents greater peace of mind
2333362 it is essential that the city of flippin has the necessary resources and equipment to protect its residents
2333363 its great that city officials are looking for ways to continuously improve the safety and security of its citizens
2333364 we name lugar energy patriots as a way to recognize outstanding hoosiers who have demonstrated leadership and initiative in taking concrete action to improve americas energy security i am pleased to recognize frank redavide of castalia homes for his efforts to build affordable energy efficient homes for hoosier families

2333366 people say homes are their greatest investment yet they are throwing money out every day why do that when they can save money in addition to having a better home
2333367 i found out 70 percent of waste that goes to landfills comes from construction in general i made a concerted effort to look into doing things green
2333368 i know how to run businesses i jumped in and immersed myself in it if youre going to go ahead and do something get the right people to help you out

2333377 it is usually found at the bottom of the river and tends only to appear when other species of crayfish have moved on
2333378 although only turkish crayfish have been affected so far we think it will be only a matter of time before it spreads to the native species and that would be a disaster there are no native crayfish left in the colne but there are still some remnants in the river stour and the river chelmer
2333379 one possible route for the spread of this disease is use of unlicenced crayfish traps the idea of this wild food is much in vogue
2333380 while this is safe to do in parts of the country where native crayfish have already been wiped out in the east of england we are trying to protect one of the last strongholds

2333385 according to our records they were delivered at 4 00 pm
2333386 what percentage of the message you communicate is conveyed through your visual appearance
2333387 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
2333388 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
2333389 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
2333390 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
2333391 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
2333392 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
2333393 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
2333394 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
2333395 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
2333396 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

2333401 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

2333412 thats the nature of the job ive been going pretty much straight for 18 months now so were going to take the time
2333413 so its been about 19 months since i saw her

2333415 and so does michelle i think so were going to take the time
2333416 if you think im going to throw my white sox under the bus because im here in minnesota thats not going to happen
2333417 its probably better that way they were a very nice group everyone was very polite we didnt have any problems with any of them
2333418 theres been an incredible outpour of requests for credentials in colorado
2333419 when it comes to making the link between our energy challenges and the need to fight global warming the administration still just doesnt get it
2333420 their so called plan to cut our oil dependence and global warming pollution is like plugging holes in a levee while water rushes over the top these challenges are too great for voluntary visionless plans that leave loopholes for fuels like liquid coal that will increase global warming emissions any new fuel used to power americas vehicles must reduce our dependence on oil and cut global warming emissions

2333433 by means of a visible face our spirit will be carried by a spiritual attraction towards the invisible majesty of the divinity through the contemplation of the image where is represented the flesh that the son of god deigned to take for our salvation may we thus adore and praise him together while glorifying in spirit this same redeemer for as it is written god is spirit and that is why we spiritually adore his divinity

2333441 no in 2006 we became fat dumb and happy we became arrogant and overconfident and had no message the republican congress didnt act like a conservative congress when we were in charge we were spending money like democrats and our base didnt appreciate that so we have to win them back with the right message and with good candidates but also theres no question that the war at that time was unpopular i think president bush is a wonderful human being but not a great communicator i dont think he got the message out there the way it had to be done but hes been proven right the surge in iraq is working why dont i think it will be as bad this year first well maintain the state senate maybe even pick up a seat second i think the republicans have an excellent chance of winning the state house back i think we have a real good shot at picking up freshman democratic congressman chris carneys seat with challenger chris hackett winning that one and were going to carry the state for john mccain
2333442 sen barack obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry
2333443 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
2333444 contrary to the findings of some researchers who have tried to posit a purely genetic origin for same sex attractions tatchell wrote genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things
2333445 homosexual activists have adopted the gay gene theory to bolster their assertion that any objection on moral grounds to homosexual activity is akin to objecting to left handedness or skin colour it has supported the accusation that christians and others who object to the homosexual movement are racists and bigots
2333446 headline microsoft to counter open source with basic software line
2333447 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 percent of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
2333448 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
2333449 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
2333450 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
2333451 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conduct a multi year test of this system
2333452 the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence
2333453 if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them
2333454 the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it
2333455 one of them did a curse with the letters upside down that was the way they did them because the object of the spell would be crooked as well
2333456 they made the dolls with the arms folded and tied so the object of the spell would be restrained
2333457 i told them curses against the lecturers dont apply because we know the counter spell
2333458 it was a very explicit spell from a woman against a man that said every time he makes love make his penis hurt
2333459 the ones you want to attract people now those are mostly done by men who want to get the girl they wanted to have a sexual relationship with them mostly
2333460 others are done by women who want to preserve the love of their partner
2333461 its not just fanciful they have to give parallels from around the world like what is the purpose or who is the god they are asking you dont make up anything
2333462 the purpose of it is therapeutic you write it down you get it out of your system
2333463 in some ways its like all humanity subjects we offer them the opportunity to develop their academic skills but we do it by using an interesting topic i guess its the kind of topic that appeals to people who might not do religious studies
2333464 that sort of concern would be brought on by a misunderstanding of what we are doing we are not advocating witchcraft we are putting it into an historical context

2333478 the drivers are equally thrilled with the package we had a lot of very interested guys touring the paddock and i am sure we will see quite a few more drivers arrive at our next test at vallelunga

2333482 now that its all coming to the light im comfortable with it but its always been in me to be that way
2333483 by the way isnt it racist to point out that bob herbert failed to recognize one of the most famous monuments in the world even though it was heavily featured in the media recently
2333484 it is like a minestrone and a lot of the vegetables are plastic
2333485 i found 26 pieces of plastic all different colors inside one stomach
2333486 the experts say there is no silver bullet we are going to keep looking but at the moment it is not clear what the best course of action would be to deal with the materials that are already there
2333487 the planet is a closed system so everything that happens on earth stays on earth
2333488 what we need to do is to accept responsibility at the local level and rescue the amount of plastic that comes down our waterways and into our ocean

2333511 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject
2333512 todays announcement is good news for the future of our aerial refueling fleet our air force and our armed forces as a whole
2333513 the situation unfolding in the georgian region of south ossetia is tragic resulting in the loss of lives by all sides
2333514 the actions taken by russia are not peacekeeping in nature and risk expanding the conflict
2333515 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject
2333516 todays announcement is good news for the future of our aerial refueling fleet our air force and our armed forces as a whole
2333517 ambulance service providers unfortunately face financial challenges from the high cost of fuel there has been a 64 2 increase in the nation wide average price of diesel fuel in just this past year fuel represents a significant portion of our operating budget and the perpetual high cost of diesel undermines our ability to provide critical heath care and first responder services to the communities we serve
2333518 i agree that we need to move quickly to pass your legislation on energy i dont understand why pelosi isnt taking more political heat
2333519 a real world example is that one of my sons who is hit the hardest by the high fuel prices has to restrict his driving to the point that it costs him revenue in developing new business hes self employed putting a 100 in to his car is nearly impossible to afford the cost for him to take service calls for clients is making it non profitable for him to accept the business
2333520 about the gas price i am a mother of 4 children and i am currently working at a 13 hour job and i can barely afford to come to work and pay the consumer bill and put food on the table and of course pay for medical
2333521 i understood what my parents could afford and lived with that
2333522 my husbands parents did not have money to give him for gas either he cut lawns and bused tables to earn his own income all through college he paid his own way by working of course college was cheaper in 1977
2333523 what is the result of our hard work and good educations in an oil crisis
2333524 this summer we have said no to swimming lessons softball ice cream cones getting together with friends etc for my kids because we dont have the money anymore to do these things we look at everything through the price involved
2333525 our youngest child should start preschool but that is not in the budget this december our middle child will be starting orthodontia but we have no idea where the money will come from for another monthly payment
2333526 there is no doubt that the lifestyle we have become accustomed to has changed yet we consider ourselves lucky because we still have work a roof over our heads cars that run and food to eat many are not this fortunate
2333527 i am a mother of four our family relies on only one income as gas prices continue to increase and as a result everything that we buy continues to increase in cost our family has felt the squeeze
2333528 thank you for all that you do to help us the struggling families of america
2333529 our family used to go out once a week to eat but cant do that anymore we used to shop for groceries once a week thats down to once a month and we have to buy less now for the gas prices our kids are wearing clothes from last yr again the price of fuel we have 2 vehicles we use 1 now for the price of fuel we used to plan trips to the lakes we cant do that anymore guess why if work was further away it wouldnt even be worth it to go as the price of fuel fuel costs have impacted everything that gets moved from 1 place to another whether it by semis trains cars boats pickups see a pattern yet our country is designed to be self sufficient and yet we buy oil from overseas why is this its sickening that a country as great as ours is dependent on some other country for survival this shouldnt be so we should be selling our wares to others tim i hope this letter helps with opening the eyes of nancy pelosi she already know but dont care what happens
2333530 my husband is retired so we have no work commute costs but we do have doctor visits and medical tests his retirement income is barely enough to live on so our higher gas prices are a hardship we do our best to combine errands but are still spending a huge amount to keep the tank full thanks for your efforts to help
2333531 we own a small business car wash and have seen a significant decrease in the number of vehicles that we wash each day we attribute this directly to the increase in gas prices that customers are paying at the pump it has become increasingly difficult to hold the line on our prices because we too much pay higher prices for our product and energy costs small business is really hurting and trying to remain optimistic has been challenging
2333532 i lost my job last year because of the company closing my husband has brain cancer it is very hard for me to get him to his appointments at the va in ann arbor due to the high prices sometimes he has to go there 4 or 5 times a week we need to get these prices lowered i know that you are doing everything that you can and i appreciate everything you do
2333533 we no longer drive our cars as often when we go into town we always do more than one errand we do not go out for pleasure as often shop out of town or take as many vacations or travel as far in the grocery store i buy fewer brand name products and shop sales
2333534 everything costs more and i agree with you congress is to blame drill now and build the necessary refineries
2333535 the significant increase in gas prices is forcing my husband and i to consider stepping down from our roles as local and regional officers for a non profit organization
2333536 current gas prices are making it very difficult for us to find volunteers to help in our work with the community and schools gas prices are forcing my husband and i to drive additional miles just to transport the few volunteers we can encourage
2333537 i come from a four car family and the high gasoline prices hurt
2333538 battle creek isnt really a town where you can ditch the car and weve got a teenager who needs to drive to gain experience for his permit yes we try to consolidate errands but my family likes to camp around michigan pulling a trailer
2333539 so yes i like you were saying you were pushing bills to expand the development of alternative energies and build new nuclear power plants
2333540 because i am a truck driver and the high price of fuel has damaged the economy so badly my employer started limiting the miles given to older higher paid drivers such as myself
2333541 because i spent every available cent on heating fuel food and electricity i could not pay the taxes on my paid for home i am now in default and my home will be forfeited in october for back taxes
2333542 i cant afford a cheaper vehicle i cant afford to repair the one vehicle here that would get a few more miles per gallon than the old f150 i am a careful shopper but the rising price of groceries also directly related to the energy crisis
2333543 my mother at age 85 gives piano lessons to supply her grocery money as energy costs have swallowed up what she can budget on her social security check
2333544 those of us who are astute enough to be aware of what is going on are sickened as congress plays partisan politics while our lives fall apart it is now july things have gotten steadily worse over the course of a year yet we have seen nothing of value come out of this congress
2333545 the rhetoric that this energy crisis is going to force us all to buy more economic vehicles and ride our bicycles everywhere ignores the fact that much of american lives in rural areas far from dwindling jobs and cant afford to buy new socially engineer us all into hud housing and the welfare roles
2333546 the past fifty years of special interest legislation has put us into a system that is destroying the american way of life
2333547 i would like to apologize to you for not attending your workshop on how to access federal grants unfortunately my husband was laid off for a week thank god it was only a week anyway we just couldnt spend the money it would take in the gas tank
2333548 in short the direct effect has been pervasive and financially devastating
2333549 my husband has worked in manufacturing sales for approximately one year and is paid straight commission
2333550 every decision is weighed based upon the extreme cost of leaving the driveway in short our existence has become solely about the process of trying to exist i am constantly forced to balance one need against another ie gas or dentistry for my son etc it is a losing battle for everyone
2333551 reality is exorbitant prices for energy are hurting small businesses and in turn its employees and families
2333552 we are doing all we can to avoid layoffs but the cots imposed on us by suppliers due to increased fuel and energy costs are impossible to control and even more impossible to pass on to end users many of whom are also struggling to stay afloat we want to stay in michigan but we also want to remain a going concern very tough to do with runaway energy costs over which we have no control
2333553 my family and i are deeply affected by the increase in gasoline prices as i drive 130 miles a day for my work
2333554 i hope you can understand my plight i ask that you and your fellows task yourselves to address the issue of rising gas prices
2333555 last month our household spent 750 in fuel we own suvs which a lot of michiganders do however they are paid off and we couldnt afford another payment right now anyways with michigans economy the way it is i have a job where i commute to jackson approx 60 miles round trip my husband has not had steady work for 2 years as he is in the construction industry if we could sell our house which is also impossible in michigan economy that could reduce my commute
2333556 i am an rn so telecommuting is impossible gas prices are driving the cost of everything up and i cannot believe how expensive food has become more and more people are finding themselves in between a rock and a hard place we have been responsible citizens have managed our finances as best we could and are now living on half of what we used to with prices rising on basic goods i cant look even 6 month down the road our congress needs to stop playing politics and focus on the people we are focusing on them and their responses thank you tim for remembering and fighting for the average american citizen god bless you
2333557 we must use a larger percentage of our income to pay for gas which means we do not have it available for other areas such as education or even necessaries for the family or house although i can and do walk to work we have high school kids who are on the go constantly because of school
2333558 high gas prices have made it more difficult to do that and especially to visit my 86 year old father who lives 100 miles away high food prices dont help either we do plan out our excursions to the stores etc so that we dont waste time and gas
2333559 i also work online which is a great savings in terms of gasoline i have three part time jobs but not everyone can do that
2333560 tim i congratulate your efforts to open up drilling in anwr and offshore
2333561 my experience with gasoline is similar to the woman in your newsletter
2333562 keep up the good work and the drive no pun intended
2333563 while i am most interested in the potential that stem cells have to save lives and make the lives better of the injured and the sick it is important to note that such research could also create new economic opportunities for our state
2333564 right now we are losing talented people with noble and good intentions to other states that are less restrictive on the types of stem cell research they allow while no one can guarantee a cure stem cell research offers hope to those suffering from cancer diabetes spinal cord injuries multiple sclerosis and many other diseases with our great universities and talented researchers there is no doubt in my mind that michigan can be a leader in this work i think it is time that we open the doors to scientists who want to do amazing things it is not a time to close those doors and tell them to go somewhere else
2333565 i hope that when michigan voters step into that booth in november they will set aside politics and vote in favor of letting science do its job
2333566 i am hopeful that these academy days will serve as educational opportunities for both students and parents the united states military academies offer students a highly regarded education and the opportunity to serve to their country a combination that many young hoosiers seek
2333567 the most significant problem i think is the ripton thats isolated because route 125 is closed both west and east of that area

2333598 interests of the saudis and the carlyle group began to look to the united states for more promising plunder

2333608 hatfill commissioned william patrick iii a biological weapons expert to write a report on how to deal with anthrax sent through the mail
2333609 the concept of a report on anthrax mail attacks two years before last octobers mailings intrigued the fbi in particular patricks report discussed mailing 2 5 grams of anthrax powder about the same amount contained in the deadly anthrax letters
2333610 it was just shock and complete disbelief that this was happening
2333611 before the sept 11 attacks ivins had worked on and held a share of two anthrax vaccine patents at least one of which was licensed to

2333633 the pictures arent the clearest but you can see the wound quite clearly
2333634 i tried at 18 but because of family values and respect for my family i chose not to
2333635 i still knew that if someday it came around that i could do it
2333636 i was always hoping and praying somehow id make this goal this dream happen
2333637 i was called grandma and old lady most of the time i was there
2333638 he said you cant be coming here i said yes i am
2333639 you cant let that happen i cant have my mom here
2333640 i wanted to try and accomplish the rest of my goal which was to come to the service and to serve the soldiers i knew what the soldiers had to go through i saw my sons go through it and i wanted to be here to be of service to them
2333641 all the way through basic training they kept emphasizing that we were going to be deployed i was wholeheartedly engaged with the fact that i was going to serve my country one way or the other
2333642 whatever my country expected of me thats what i was going to do
2333643 i wasnt looking for anybody to be my significant other when i got to fort stewart
2333644 he came over to me in the foxhole and said what are you shooting at
2333645 he said from the first day he met me youre going to marry me he was telling everybody
2333646 ive always felt that when soldiers accept me as working hard and getting them where they need to be helping them accomplish their mission that is my reward
2333647 he said that since he was retiring i would be retiring too
2333648 for anybody over 40 who really wants to come to the service there is a very big reward here
2333649 you have to come here open minded you cant come here as your own individual you have to be willing to change and you have to be willing to serve

2333669 al rahmaan is the owner of vast mercy because the falaan form in arabic indicates vastness and abundance as it is said rajal ghadbaan a very angry man when he is filled with anger al raheem is a name which refers to the action as the faeel form refers to the doer of an action so the phrase al rahmaan al raheem indicates that the mercy of allaah is vast as is understood from the name al rahmaan and that it encompasses his creation as is understood from the name al raheem this is what some of them meant when they said that al rahmaan refers to mercy in a general sense and al raheem refers to mercy that is specifically for the believers but what we have mentioned is more accurate
2333670 in the midst of the enormous problems our country is now facing with high energy costs foreclosures bank failures global warming etc it is imperative that we not push aside another major crisis which in many ways is getting worse and that is the health care crisis

2333672 according to the bureau of labor statistics more than 1 2 million new and replacement nurses will be needed by 2014 yet we are nowhere close to educating enough nurses to meet this need which is why the u s department of health foresees a shortage of over one million nurses by the year 2020
2333673 i am happy to announce today that the higher education act passed last week includes a major provision that i introduced which enables our colleges to significantly increase the number of nurses they train
2333674 this nursing provision provides colleges community colleges and universities a grant for each additional student their nursing programs enroll over their previous average enrollment
2333675 one of the goals is to graduate more advanced degree nurses so that we can begin to have the necessary faculty we desperately need if we are to train more nurses in the next decade
2333676 not only is nursing an honorable and important profession but that nursing jobs pay good wages something our economy very much needs
2333677 with an aging population with thousands of veterans returning from iraq and afghanistan in need of continuing medical care and with a nursing shortage looming we need to act boldly the new program i introduced and which has been passed by the congress and which will next week be signed into law by the president will provide many new nurses for only a modest outlay of federal funds through this program we are on the verge of successfully addressing the nursing shortage that lies ahead
2333678 my hope is that this provision will result in an additional 10 000 or more students graduating from nursing schools each year at a modest cost
2333679 at a time when home heating prices are soaring and people are sweltering in the south it is beyond comprehension that the president would threaten to veto desperately needed legislation that has the support of a tripartisan majority of senators the nations governors aarp and others
2333680 people in the north understand that it would be inhumane to stand by while seniors freeze to death this winter or kids get sick
2333681 people in hot weather states know heat waves can be killers
2333682 it is impossible to understand george w bushs priorities hes for trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy and he is spending 10 billion a month on iraq but hes a penny pincher when it comes to making sure families seniors and the sick dont go cold this winter
2333683 fema resources are critical to help vermont and its towns respond to this disaster we urgently request your support of a presidential disaster declaration for the state of vermont
2333684 the ground over the northern and central parts of the state is completely saturated and unable to absorb these record amounts of rain with continued forecasts for significant additional rain this week rivers have flooded their banks and remain precariously high many of our towns are dealing with road washouts downed trees that restrict emergency access and power outages
2333685 my hope is that this provision will result in an additional 10 000 or more students graduating from nursing schools each year at a modest cost
2333686 in the midst of the enormous problems our country is now facing with high energy costs foreclosures bank failures and global warming it is imperative that we not push aside another major crisis which in many ways is getting worse and that is the health care crisis
2333687 castleton is delighted with the hard work of senator sanders and his colleagues in addressing the nationwide nursing shortage
2333688 nursing is our most expensive program due to the very close personalized interaction that is necessary among nursing students faculty and clinical supervisors and tuition alone does not cover the cost of our very successful program with some of the highest nursing exam test scores in the country the sanders provision will allow many colleges such as ours to expand their programs in order to address this critical nursing shortage
2333689 our priority is the safety of people who visit it or use it for recreational purposes
2333690 the processes that produced this decision need to be called into question
2333691 it risks a further decline in the quality of new zealand health care and is another incentive for specialists to move out of this environment
2333692 its completely frustrating that we cant practice good quality medicine
2333693 if this is the decision we get from the wealth of evidence presented
2333694 we presented our submission in person and we felt they were polite and receptive but we went away not very optimistic
2333695 getting the consultation was a win but not what we wanted we wanted someone to say that given the information they should have come to a different conclusion

2333712 vaccine a the covert government experiment thats killing our soldiers
2333713 only one paper at the workshop reported near perfect results 100 percent protection from the ames strain with just one or two shots
2333714 why would active duty reserve and national guard personnel jeopardize their military careers and even their liberty rather than take the vaccine the missing element of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program is trust radiation testing agent orange the reckless use of experimental drugs and mysterious gulf war illness have made military men and women understandably distrustful of the pentagon on medical matters

2333785 he joe just stood in the door and said i need your help ive killed david hes dead he knew exactly what he was saying and he wanted an alibi he wanted me to say i was with them drinking at the pub and i was driving and a truck came along and swiped davids head
2333786 he was ranting and raving about his brother getting out of prison and coming to visit them joe decided he didnt want him there and wanted to call police
2333787 he kept saying if they cant get rid of him i will i told him not to do anything stupid
2333788 his head was right under the dash his arm was sort of out the window and you could just smell the booze i felt for a pulse but there was none he wasnt cold but there was blood and gunk all over the place
2333789 he was ranting and raving a lot about killing his brother
2333790 the dead one had his arm out the window i walked past and tried to feel for a pulse but he was dead they didnt know what to do so i told them they had to call the law get them around
2333791 at first he tried to say that because he didnt have a licence or something he tried to say his brother was too drunk to drive so he was going to drive and he reckons he was hanging out the window and a truck collected him
2333792 for that to happen he would have had to be driving on the wrong side of the road
2333793 from that alone i thought it was worth putting it in front of a jury
2333794 it was apparent that what happened that night happened pretty close to the car i dont know if the car was the scene of the murder there was never any suggestion he was out of his brothers company
2333795 part of my job is to review police files and decide whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed against a suspect
2333796 in 1990 i reviewed this file and advised the police there was insufficient evidence at that time to proceed i wont say who the suspect is or who we were looking at
2333797 i am bound by confidentiality to my client which is the police i could not comment on that
2333798 i dont think it is fair for me to do that comment without having any of the knowledge that grant currently has got of it
2333799 as ive said id prefer all questions go through grant
2333800 i am sick of feeling like the suspect and being treated like a liar i want my life back and im tired of carrying this around with me year after year
2333801 davids death had nothing to do with me he was a bully a thug and if he got killed by being donged over the head by somebody it wasnt by me
2333802 i just happened to be drinking with him that night all i know was that there was a big fight
2333803 i came out and went around the corner for a piss and i heard a hell of a commotion a big fight when i got back he was in the car and he mumbled something and slumped over i didnt know how bad he was there was no blood or anything
2333804 as far as im concerned that was 18 years ago and i had nothing to do with it i was told to bugger off or ill cop the same treatment i was told to disappear all i know was there was a bloody big battle and i was told to piss off for a while

2333809 its tough trying to get our actuarys to analyze online gaming for the greater society online business risk
2333810 its time we catch up with the resk of the online gaming for the greater society business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that online gaming for the greater society product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
2333811 were already researching able counsel for labor union related insurance claimes
2333812 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
2333813 we believe we have a right to the same protections afforded to offline businesses despite the fact that we dont have a physical place of business
2333814 our legal team has already thoroughly researched how to file an insurance claim for online business
2333815 mostly because we want to expedite the payout process should we have to make a claim the internet marketing world moves much faster than the physical marketing realm and as a result we would lose significant business from any down time associated with a drawn out insurance claim
2333816 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another online gaming for the greater society company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard
2333817 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that
2333818 just as we study car home or life insurance we will be studying online business insurance well be using special mathematic models to figure out the risk that online gaming for the greater society businesses bear against what would be deemed a reasonable insurance premium

2333839 most online gaming for the greater society companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
2333840 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
2333841 our online gaming for the greater society company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded

2333867 woe is me if i do not preach the gospel
2333868 every evangelizer is expected to have a reverence for truth especially since the truth that he studies and communicates is none other than revealed truth and hence more than any other a sharing in the first truth which is god himself the preacher of the gospel will therefore be a person who even at the price of personal renunciation and suffering always seeks the truth that he must transmit to others he never betrays or hides truth out of a desire to please men in order to astonish or to shock nor for the sake of originality or a desire to make an impression he does not refuse truth he does not obscure revealed truth by being too idle to search for it or for the sake of his own comfort or out of fear he does not neglect to study it he serves it generously without making it serve him
2333869 the work of evangelization presupposes in the evangelizer an ever increasing love for those whom he is evangelizing that model evangelizer the apostle paul wrote these words to the thessalonians and they are a program for us all with such yearning love we chose to impart to you not only the gospel of god but our very selves so dear had you become to us i thessalonians 2 8 what is this love it is much more than that of a teacher it is the love of a father and again it is the love of a mother it is this love that the lord expects from every preacher of the gospel from every builder of the church a sign of love will be the concern to give the truth and to bring people into unity another sign of love will be a devotion to the proclamation of jesus christ without reservation or turning back
2333870 it is often said nowadays that the present century thirsts for authenticity especially in regard to young people it is said that they have a horror of the artificial or false and that they are searching above all for truth and honesty these signs of the times should find us vigilant either tacitly or aloud but always forcefully we are being asked do you really believe what you are proclaiming do you live what you believe do you really preach what you live the witness of life has become more than ever an essential condition for real effectiveness in preaching precisely because of this we are to a certain extent responsible for the progress of the gospel that we proclaim

2333885 were down more than any sector in the second quarter of 2007
2333886 the nine inside the secret world of the supreme court
2333887 todays opinion is the product of a court which is the product of a law profession culture that has largely signed on to the so called homosexual agenda by which i mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct
2333888 the use of the courts rather than the electoral process
2333889 desegregation decrees were quickly followed by barely less sweeping orders demanding institutionalized tolerance and often favorable treatment not only for blacks and women but also for gays hispanics endangered species and any other group with the ability to pursue a political agenda by class action lawsuit
2333890 such victories opened liberals up to the politically powerful and not entirely unfair charge by the likes of right wing provocateur dinesh dsouza that these massive social changes had been imposed on americans without regard for political process or the strongly felt preferences of significant majorities of americans
2333891 the left has relied on the courts to declare a right and then enforce the right against the will of the american people and their elected representatives in this sense the biggest victories of the cultural left in the past few decades have all been achieved undemocratically
2333892 what if she turns up dead will they interrogate me
2333893 it all matters every single detail please dont leave anything out
2333894 logical logical there is nothing logical about a daughter leaving home ms rice i assure you nothing logical about abandoning safety
2333895 yes i did that i tried to kill myself in a parisian hotel room many years ago its kind of funny you know we were on vacation and the next day in one of the museums we had to walk through an exhibit that was lit with black lights the infection glowed and i showed it to the kids as if it would be an important lesson in the natural sciences
2333896 my husband wanted a divorce i was completely unprepared for his announcement afterall we were supposed to be on a family vacation i took a few bottles of hard liquor out of the hotel minibar and locked myself into one of the bathrooms of the adjoining rooms inside there was a bottle of nina ricci and i smashed it and began drinking vodka and slicing i tried very hard to succeed but i guess im just not the type to be successful at that sort of thing well not then at least
2333897 what do you mean mrs quaid did you try again
2333898 oh yes but it was completely unpremeditated that time i almost succeeded but was saved
2333899 but you said you wanted to tell me everything and that sounds like an important part mrs quaid im not being nosey you know you want this dont you
2333900 well yes i do but i have told the story so many times to so many people that i hate to do it again it is almost as if it didnt happen anymore it is that far away its become mythological
2333901 hmm yes it bothered her very much at the time and for many years after she never even told me about it until she was almost thirteen apparently i forgot to tell the children that their father had changed his mind and there would be no divorce we went from france to new york and back and the whole time they were on pins and needles i felt awful about that and i still do to some extent anyway as much as a person can regret such accidents
2333902 on our way back home from new york we passed through paris once again our flight was delayed and they booked us into a horrible little suite outside of paris we made the best of it though my husband and i we were once again close and mindful of each other we bought a bottle of white wine and then took a walk in a graveyard near our small hotel we left the kids alone she must have been horribly upset thinking that her parents were about to divorce and the three of them were left all alone in a place that was quite foreign to them
2333903 no it isnt guilt ms rice guilt isnt the word for it the word for it might be prophecy
2333904 did you feel as though it was foreshadowing of some type
2333905 ah so you know about my work ms rice i havent written anything in years i dont want to anymore it is all too serious for mere poetry or story telling you know for that matter the word foreshadowing is a massive understatement for the real world and how it plays upon the mind of the writer let alone the reader it is a conspicuous crime if you ask me
2333906 you know exactly what i mean please dont feel bad about it ive given you permission to talk about it to write about it and to embellish it if you need to but i dont think you will you are the first person and the last person i have ever told i just do not want to take it with me into another graveyard you know
2333907 well i think she liked the matter of our divorce
2333908 what you mean that i cant imagine a child wanting something like that
2333909 oh i have proof she was quite disappointed many a time when ahmed and i would have a tiff id threaten hed leave for a few hours and id exploit my childrens sympathies in the worst ways i didnt mean to but desperation is never easy to manage successfully you try to play both parts but end up playing only one no matter how hard you try ms rice no matter how hard you try you end up spinning a tenacious little web of deceit all around you and everything gets stuck in it just like this there tends to be casualties it can be quite unpredictable
2333910 i guess i am theres nothing wrong with being ambivalent if your heart is in the right place i believe mine is or at least i still want it to be
2333911 no probably not no one can know another ms rice not at least in the way you are hoping how can you know me if i dont even understand only allah understands us ms rice
2333912 ten years ms rice i bought them for two dollars at a small store in my husbands village
2333913 its okay ms rice you are very young you are also easy to read why do you think i chose you to write down this letter you are an honest one
2333914 a letter what do you mean a letter who is it to
2333915 mark my words here is what is going to happen within a decade maybe two or three christians will come around to treating gays no differently than they now treat other groups whom they previously persecuted women jews blacks but not because of some new interpretation of a biblical passage or because of a new revelation from god these changes will come about the same way that they always do by the oppressed minority fighting for the right to be treated equally and by a few enlightened members of the oppressing majority supporting their cause then what will happen is that christians will take credit for the civil liberation of gays dig through the historical record and find a few christian bloggers or preachers who had the courage and the character to stand up for gay rights when their fellow christians would not and then cite those as evidence that were it not for christianity gays would not be equal

2333952 its going to be a different kind of adoption story
2333953 the supreme court has repeatedly ruled that the first amendment requires of state government not just neutrality among religions but also neutrality between religion and irreligion the current strategy of obeying the law by avoiding religion in schools may well be violating the constitution by indoctrinating students into a secular view of the world
2333954 the question is turning from whether to teach about religion to how and plainly the way to do that is to steer clear of both advocating religion and impugning it while at the same time communicating that individual religious convictions are to be treated as a matter of both law and civility with respect
2333955 two problems arise with thinking of religious literacy as moral instruction
2333956 i still dont know why people got so upset about it

2334002 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president
2334003 however it doesnt mean that we cant take action against him just because he is a vip

2334058 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all
2334059 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
2334060 the spice girls reunion tour was a very healing experience for me it put to bed every bit of doubt guilt insecurity i had about leaving the girls when i did i felt id made amends with them

2334068 a week after baghdads liberation burkle was informed that he was being replaced
2334069 burkles job was handed to james k haveman jr a sixty year old social worker who was largely unknown among international health experts he had no medical degree but he had connections he had been the community health director for the former republican governor of michigan john engler who recommended him to wolfowitz haveman was well traveled but most of his overseas trips were in his capacity as a director of international aid a faith based relief organization that provided health care while promoting christianity in the developing world prior to his stint in government haveman ran a large christian adoption agency in michigan that urged pregnant women not to have abortions

2334074 but people have the freedom to believe whatever they want to believe if someone believes that homosexuality is wrong that is their right and they should be free to say it
2334075 it shouldnt be in the world or in the united states
2334076 we once considered black people to be second class citizens in this country but we have learned from our mistakes and now realize that that was wrong and that the color of a persons skin does not make him or her any less of a human being than anyone else
2334077 hardaway is a bigot because there is nothing wrong with homosexuality

2334095 the new players have come in and all done well
2334096 it is always good to have a few new faces in the group and hopefully we have made them feel welcome also
2334097 sometimes you only need a few changes to make a big difference and hopefully the players who have been signed will help us achieve that
2334098 we already had a really strong team and now we have added to what we had so that can only be a good thing
2334099 he will get better this season which is great for liverpool and has got to be a worry for the rest of the division
2334100 you saw how good he was at the european championships and i am sure scoring the winning goal in the final will have done his confidence the world of good
2334101 i am looking forward to playing alongside him of course i am torres is the kind of striker that anyone would want to play alongside
2334102 he makes great runs holds the ball up well to allow support to get around him and when he gets the chance in front of goal he is deadly
2334103 i cannot wait for the real stuff to start and hopefully we will work well together
2334104 i do not see any reason why we will not be a successful partnership but the manager has got a lot of options in attack so i am really going to have to hit the ground running
2334105 i have sacrificed everything for this club i have given up the chance of three gold logies

2334125 if you go into any tulsa oklahoma classroom the teachers that can figure it out have already figured it out
2334126 in tulsa oklahoma every teacher does the best they know how
2334127 whitaker is one of the better inspirational speakers weve had
2334128 every time a teacher tells me the parents should have taught that student better you know i say i say well of course they should have but this is where we separate the good teachers from the great teachers
2334129 we know its important to reach out and connect artists and fans that might be on opposite sides of the globe just as much as the fans that live two towns apart
2334130 we know how important the global country music community truly is
2334131 as an industry association we are always eager to partner with fan based initiatives like digital rodeo
2334132 this is the kind of positive exposure that connects our canadian country artists with international fans and helps us promote our mandate in a unique and interactive way
2334133 pi ce encore plus frappante du puzzle de la vie
2334134 i suspect thats only a tiny fraction of cases since most go unreported
2334135 if this is happening in kenya where at least we have rules and regulations imagine what the rest of africa is like
2334136 i went to palestine in 2005 and what i saw changed my life and id do anything to help the starving and impoverished people of gaza
2334137 this is the first trip going to palestine and i am quite nervous
2334138 id like to say to him blair if ive got the guts to go you should have the honour to go show some guts youre supposed to be representing these people palestinians as well lip service to the suffering of the gazans without witnessing it at first hand makes a mockery of his mr blairs role
2334139 im apprehensive about what measures the israelis may take to prevent us reaching gaza but that goes with the territory
2334140 politically it would mean the end of the blockade and i cant see israel allowing it to happen
2334141 mr blair had to postpone his planned visit to gaza due to a specific security threat which would have made it irresponsible to proceed not just for those visiting but also the local community he looks forward to being able to go to gaza again in the future and will of course in the meantime continue both to meet regularly with people from gaza and work to improve conditions there
2334142 china has failed to live up to the ideals of the olympics the international olympic committee has failed to protect the olympics from china
2334143 it is also a failure for the world how could they allow china to stage the olympics symbolising equality among mankind
2334144 chinese people may deserve the games but not when their authorities are orchestrating violence inside tibet
2334145 many tibetans including monks and nuns are tortured and imprisoned we are protesting for their release and appealing to the international community to help to release these religious people
2334146 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding online gaming i look to the studies and conclusions of fickling kuruvilla who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
2334147 to be blunt a perfect example of online gaming is given in the following article
2334148 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
2334149 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
2334150 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
2334151 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
2334152 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
2334153 in the past government impact assessments have underestimated time and requirements for small businesses our own research has shown that the time required by our members to unravel the complicated tangle of red tape and do what is expected of them as owners and managers is significantly more than the governments estimations
2334154 its like georgina just jumped in me and took off
2334155 we support any efforts of people trying to take power back
2334156 the whole reason that these murders were allowed to continue for so long was because of how vulnerable our women are
2334157 the police who were already seeking someone for similar acts at la defense the high rise business park to the west of the capital arrested a man on thursday morning who appears to have confessed
2334158 has just said he intends to convert to judaism before marrying his fianc e who is jewish and the heiress to the founders of darty
2334159 could be interpreted as drawing a link between conversion to judaism and social success
2334160 condemned most vigorously these racist acts destined to taint the name and the family of the president of the republic
2334161 the ump expects the justice system to react with the greatest severity against acts which recall the most sombre hours of our history
2334162 final report of the provincial partnership committee on missing persons
2334163 it could be just one tip that could make the difference
2334164 in order for justice to be served those with information must share it with the police there has been too much silence from those with knowledge
2334165 i got a letter in the mail that basically said if you want to take the pills we will help you get that from the doctor and we will stand there and watch you die but we wont give you the medication to live
2334166 news of payment denial is tough enough for a terminally ill person to bear
2334167 imagine if the recipient had pinned his hope for survival on an unproven treatment or if this were the first time he understood the disease had entered the terminal phase the impact of such a letter would be devastating
2334168 but im opposed to the assisted suicide law i havent considered it even at my lowest point
2334169 i was the first person my mom called when she got the letter
2334170 while i was telling her mom it will be ok i was crying but trying to stay brave for her
2334171 ive talked to so many people who have gone through the same problems with the oregon health plan
2334172 to me its worth a lot this is my life theyre playing with
2334173 its challenging because health care is very expensive but thats not the real essence of our priority list
2334174 we need evidence to say it is a good use of taxpayers dollars
2334175 it may be expensive but if it does wonders we cover it
2334176 we look as exhaustively as we can with good peer review evidence
2334177 now we have to review to ensure sensitivity and clarity
2334178 not only is the patient receiving had news but insensitivity on top of that this is something that requires the human touch
2334179 a sobering degree of caution in legalizing assisted death in a medical care environment that is characterized by increasing pressure on physicians to control the cost of care
2334180 the reason is that hospice care where most patients are at the end of life is relatively inexpensive
2334181 in the rest of the country insurance companies are making these decisions and are not paying for suicide
2334182 involuntary choices are foisted on people all the time by virtue of denials
2334183 i am surprised there hasnt been a revolt in this country
2334184 most of my objections are that some second rate guy on the staff of the insurance company is second guessing one of the foremost authorities and trumping his judgment
2334185 i am fortunate to have the financial resources and the ability to fight these people who would rather these you die
2334186 a course of chemo would not cure but would subdue the cancer long enough to be meaningful
2334187 there are many people with slow growing but nonetheless metastatic cancer for whom death while inevitable is many years away
2334188 the problem with the oregon plan is it sounds like administrators not physicians are making treatment decisions
2334189 and if a patient can get assisted death paid for but not cancer treatment the choice is obvious
2334190 its purely optional and the patient and doctor can walk away from it
2334191 its not the mad rush our enemies predicted and for our residents it has worked out well
2334192 people cling to life and look for every sort of crazy cure to keep alive and usually they are better off not to have done it
2334193 the doctor did say it would put a lid on the cancer and i am hopeful
2334194 i think we all knew that this is her last hope
2334195 i am sick and tired of the dollar being the bottom line of everything we need to put human life above the dollar
2334196 predictably critics of oregons unique in the nation law are aflame over wagners story some claiming it covers killing but not cancer
2334197 mbak dah punya pacar belum kok ibu gak pernah liat temen cowok mbak main ke sini kapan kapan diajak kesini ya biar ibu bisa mengenalnya

2334204 entitled to teach anything that is reasonably related to the goals of preparing students to become engaged and productive citizens in our democracy
2334205 diversity is a hallmark of our nation it is increasingly evident that our diversity includes differences in sexual orientation
2334206 begun a process of intentionally indoctrinating very young children to affirm the notion that homosexuality is right and normal in direct denigration of the plaintiffs deeply held faith
2334207 but people have a right to their religious beliefs its who they are how can you expect them to set aside their most cherished beliefs on an issue so volatile as gay marriage
2334208 you want to talk religion go to church this matter concerns civil law and religion has no place in such matters
2334209 for the non statisticians among us the following gives a laymans summary of the validation problems in the csiro bom drought report
2334210 well done david this puts you in the same company as mcintyre and koutsoyiannis
2334211 first and foremost we hope the athletes are inspired by the music but the initiative also draws attention to the lack of fundamental freedoms for those under chinese rule including tibetans
2334212 we began contacting athletes as soon as the album was done we knew once the athletes were in beijing the great firewall of china might prevent accessibility to downloads
2334213 we support the olympics the athletes and the accomplishments of the chinese citizens in hosting the olympics
2334214 if olympic athletes cannot speak their conscience however the chinese government is treating olympic athletes like modern day gladiators to be used for sport and entertainment this is against everything the olympics stand for one cant support the olympics while denying athletes their fundamental freedom of speaking the truth
2334215 this initiative is a wonderful statement about freedom of expression and a reminder to those in beijing for the games to remember the crisis in tibet
2334216 to calcutta or any other place where a lunatic asylum may be established
2334217 gaoler 25 rupees overseer 15 rupees two convicts 10 rupees
2334218 it has been proved that in recent cases of insanity under judicious treatment as large a proportion of recoveries will take place as from any other acute disease of equal severity
2334219 there is space enough in the hospital yard to construct a suitable building for their reception and we hope that the absolute necessity there exists for providing something in the nature of a lunatic asylum will not be overlooked
2334220 a report on the number and state of the lunatics under treatment and also suggestions for their better management
2334221 should be laid with bricks on edge embedded in good mortar so as to admit of being washed and prevent the patients lifting the floors which constructed with tiles as in the jail they have been enabled to do so
2334222 wood for the walls and bed places in consequence of very bad effects having arisen from patients in the jail having destroyed the bed places and by squatting on the floor and leaning against cold walls have in several instances cramped their limbs and stiffened their joints so as to cause lameness
2334223 isolation of the insane with proper justification was then thought necessary and custodial care was the mainstay of the day
2334224 a foreign body that had to be expelled from the body
2334225 a medical complex which would include a new general hospital lunatic asylum medical stores and dispensary
2334226 tibet was is and will always be a part of china
2334227 romanticised nonsense spewed about tibet does not change the fact that it has been a part of chinese empire for three centuries
2334228 gather ing and publish ing documented reports throughout the world of systematic communist injustice behind the iron curtain
2334229 do not think that those landed aristocrats and feudal lords of tibet who took refuge in india can speak for the tibetan people
2334230 these people the protestors attempting to extinguish the olympic torch does not know the history
2334231 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
2334232 right now we are the asking the questions you are the 1500th respondent
2334233 there have been problems with the torch but now is the time for the party
2334234 we have travelled to so many cities from olympia to the great wall we have cried so many times
2334235 it is very emotional especially when you see the reaction of the chinese crowds
2334236 not only are the chinese addressing the world but they are addressing 1 3 billion people in their own country and i think we will see the real china
2334237 i think this will mean a lot for the perception of china the rest of the world will find a country with 5 000 years of history a fascinating country i believe the spotlight on china will help the world to understand china and it will also help china to understand the world
2334238 it was not difficult to get through the security as we had been planning this for four years
2334239 we wanted to make a call to world leaders and the chinese government for meaningful change we knew there were risks but they were nothing compared to the suffering tibetans have endured
2334240 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle well carry on fighting and there will be more protests during the olympics
2334241 the us believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2334242 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2334243 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
2334244 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues

2334251 the aggregate of individuals within some population definition who experienced the same event within the same time interval in this case the students experience the same savings campaign in primary and secondary school across the limited time frame of 1968 1978
2334252 similarly located as they are all exposed to the same phase of the collective process
2334253 highest average amount of savings per student over a specific period

2334264 that course is fucked one lap is enough to jack you up
2334265 they werent trying to cut corners washing the van i want my kids to learn from them its so easy to have parents take care of things but instead they went out and did something about it its a good lesson in responsibility
2334266 its become a culture that they have these big booze ups a school ball is a time where theres expectation for heavy drinking
2334267 a party of 40 kids can very quickly turn into hundreds with smashed bottles some parents are a bit naive about what kids get up to it only takes one person to have a knife
2334268 say to them if you do get drunk this is what you can do if theyre too scared to ring their parents when they get stuck theyre going to do something stupid
2334269 the key purpose of the evening is the school ball essentially its a function organised and run by student leaders its their occasion but on our terms we dont support pre or post ball parties at all
2334270 i can appreciate why the schools often dont want to be involved things can go pear shaped
2334271 if you hear theres an after party offer to help for heavens sake
2334272 we know who that person is and we are absolutely confident that they will be identified
2334273 there were five or six people in the group but we were only looking for four people
2334274 a couple of them were asleep and one was still awake when in the middle of the night they were subjected to this
2334275 they co operated with the demands that were made but made sure they observed the offenders

2334298 we want saints and gurus and leaders and heroes because we are lazy we think they have done all the work and all that we have to do is just to follow them you know when you follow somebody youre not only destroying yourself but the other whom you follow
2334299 it is a phenomenon that is taking place all over italy and it is growing all the time in the last few days 120 black cats have vanished in milan
2334300 in venice 63 have gone and in florence 20 disappeared in a week and a similar number have gone missing in rome we have strong suspicions that these cats are being used in satanic rituals
2334301 we want to halt this massacre educate people and restore dignity to black cats
2334302 it would be great if he would speak out in recognition of our initiative and say the prejudice against black cats is a lot of nonsense
2334303 we are aware of several cases where the corpses of black cats have been found at sites used by satanists they are sacrificed as part of rituals they believe in

2334319 there are economic burdens the dhb district health board has recognised it needs more funding for counsellors and for subsidising mental health problems
2334320 in talking about suicide prevention the point would be to help people before they get to a suicidal crisis point and are calling up the emergency line
2334321 theres a gap which i believe the dhb is trying to address for the mild to moderate group to access support
2334322 its not very clear cut because of criteria restrictions it can be frustrating for people to know if they have access to them
2334323 there has also been an increase in the severity of cases we are seeing increasingly students need more sessions and more people are coming in who have already been diagnosed with a mental illness

2334330 in his 2000 election campaign george w bush spoke of the need for humility in our approach to the world yet we went into iraq with the arrogant belief that we could remake the country as we wanted it to be we failed miserably we should do now what we should have done at the start defer to the peoples of iraq they have concluded that a single country is not possible except in name
2334331 whether they are living in a region gutted by war or in a banality riddled nation like our own the experience of modernity for many people is a lifetime of loneliness the ache of utter isolation in an impossibly huge and uncaring world it is a cocktail of fear and loneliness that brings people to the door of a church or a mosque or that encourages receptivity to the words of a skate pastor or a madrasa teacher fundamentalism offers a snake oil cure for their ills promising the tight community groups of churches the steadfast solidarity of activist groups and most of all the deep certainty of biblical inerrancy

2334361 many designers have their own ideas about what constitutes readable text but much of this wisdom seems to be based on tried and tested rules from the world of print while researching articles on the subject they often seemed to restate concepts i first heard twenty years ago
2334362 we have created an easy to use web application which allows users to adjust an on screen display until they find the text that is easiest to read they can adjust the font size line height and column width the major contributing factors in legibility
2334363 our goal is to publish a report that provides hard facts about what constitutes readable text on the web
2334364 we see this report being of value not just to our clients and their customers but to web users at large
2334365 people are justifiably focused on pocketbook concerns in todays economy ethanol is one of the few things helping families save money
2334366 now dont try that on your own only do that with uncle scott
2334367 i reckon carlos tevez will score more premiership goals than fernando torres and so im looking for a plucky scouser to take me on to the tune of 100 000 at even money to prove me wrong
2334368 i think paying 20 3million for robbie keane is a waste of money liverpool were clearly fourth best last season and i dont see how their signings this summer will improve them all that much
2334369 robbie keane is the best signing the club could have made anyone would want him in their team hes the signing of the summer
2334370 i think hell get better this year which is great news for liverpool and got to be a worry for the rest of the division
2334371 im looking forward to playing alongside him of course i am torres is the kind of striker that anyone would want to play alongside
2334372 he makes great runs holds the ball up well to allow support to get around him and when he gets the chance in front of goal hes deadly
2334373 i cant wait for the real stuff to start and hopefully well work well together
2334374 i dont see any reason why we wont be a successful partnership but the managers got a lot of options in attack so im really going to have to hit the ground running
2334375 just being able to take part at a second olympic games is a dream for me
2334376 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
2334377 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
2334378 it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
2334379 its important for any athlete to defend the gold medal
2334380 i might be the only person from my country ever to do it and ill go down in history i want to go to beijing because nothing counts for me more than helping my nation
2334381 missing some games for liverpool is not good but when you talk about your country you always want to play for them
2334382 and for brazil the olympics is like the world cup because brazil has never won the gold medal

2334397 her contributions to our student athletes and their quest for excellence have been significant i am grateful for her guidance to our student athletes and their championship success in competition the classroom and as members of our society
2334398 as you float around the country and compete against national caliber teams you learn what the championship programs look like how they act how they carry themselves how they handle adversity and what their culture is creating that championship culture at miami is my primary objective a place where athletes trust themselves are committed to the process and have a sense of personal responsibility i envision a redhawk tradition where everyone involved with the program from student athletes to administration is working toward championships and is unapologetic and relentless in that pursuit
2334399 from my time at south florida and at michigan state ive been fortunate to work with competitive cross country and track and field programs that won conference titles and began to earn national recognition and im looking to bring that experience with me to miami
2334400 i feel lucky to have been associated with the entire michigan state athletic department
2334401 there is truly a family dynamic there which is really special when i interviewed at miami i felt that same sense of support and family from brad bates to associate athletic director jennie gilbert and everyone i talked to on my interview i have always felt that what we accomplished at msu with the womens program was a direct result of the schools love and support it feels amazing as a coach and as an athlete to be able to take risks and try anything and know that youve got an unwavering support system behind you i believe that unique dynamic exists at miami

2334431 national walk 4 justice has been in the works since january 2008
2334432 this walk came to me as a vision in september 2007 while walking down the highway of tears in b c for the second anniversary of my missing niece tamara lynn chipman who disappeared without a trace she was last seen just out of prince rupert bc september 21 2005 to this day she has not been found and there is no closure or accountability for our family
2334433 after tamaras disappearance i started researching on line and contacting the many family members who have lost their loved ones i realized that there were far too many families suffering because there has been no justice our databases have increased to over 3 000 women and children still missing or remain unsolved murderers across the country over 200 in two areas in b c alone this is not including those who have died through acts of domestic violence or those who are still disappearing at an average of about three a week
2334434 ottawa is where they are opening up for their sessions what a perfect day to deliver our message we plan on spending the whole day at parliament with speakers demanding government action to address this brutality towards women we want accountability in order to get accountability we need equality we need to revamp the judicial system law enforcements all levels of government and leadership in order to move forward into a sustainable society we need to address the racism poverty homelessness and domestic violence running rapid in this country women are targeted nation wide and we need it to stop
2334435 on the van you will see pictures of woman who have been murdered and missing and some of them have not been solved yet my little cousin was two years old and was killed by her uncle and how he only got a lesser sentence isnt right they are getting away with murder

2334441 i often hear people say that they hate living on a budget yes it would be really nice to have so much money that i didnt have to keep close tabs on where it all goes but i like knowing where my money goes people seem to get annoyed when they cant do something and tend to blame the budget its not the budgets fault the budget is not some evil entity that dictates where your money goes you decide where the money goes yes its no fun when there isnt enough money to do what you want but chances are its because of the budget that you know that and wont accidentally come up short because you thought there was enough money using a budget can be a great tool to help you ultimately save up for the things you want

2334447 what is my creator trying to teach me that i might never learn if he were to suddenly pluck me out of this situation
2334448 what character qualities is he trying to grow in me patience trust compassion contentment
2334449 doing this really makes me realize what a caring society we do have
2334450 and that a lot of people dont realize what is going on in canada which is sad to say
2334451 i think about the family members that we have met throughout this journey where they have been victims of so many injustices after so many years of pain looking for their loved ones
2334452 we have a high percentage of women who are driven into the streets because they have nowhere else to go
2334453 that plays a large part in it and it is time that canada realizes that first nations are humans too and we deserve to be treated with respect and honour
2334454 ive been looking forward to this day because it was so long in coming we have lost so many relatives and nobody seems to care and we dont know where their gravesites are nobody is doing anything about it its like they are sweeping it under the carpet
2334455 who is going to do this for us except the first nations people they need to come forward and say enough is enough
2334456 but you have to go because of the what if you know
2334457 our morale has been boosted because of the numerous phone calls of support weve received from the families of those other women redman and geddes
2334458 they know what were going through and it has given us strength to keep looking for daleen
2334459 according to our cultural protocols we do things in four
2334460 if weve raised awareness about this issue which i think we have then weve accomplished our goal
2334461 we will always be optimistic about bringing daleen home again well always stay that way

2334464 we have to stop the violence against women we know violence sees no colour so were not speaking just for the first nations people were speaking for all women were the life givers of society and someone has to care
2334465 i read about it and said this is a cause i can support
2334466 their cause is our cause its humanitys cause its mankinds cause not just women but men as well
2334467 i think people are really supporting us they sympathize they can understand the cause no one wants to lose a brother a sister an auntie a mother so i really feel like were gaining support and people have been really kind to us
2334468 i started researching the highway of tears missing women and theres way more than what the police are saying their list is up to 18 and i have at least 44 who are missing just from the highway of tears
2334469 were going to be having a rally in ottawa on sept 15 to address the prime minister and minister chuck strahl and to demand a public inquiry into the deaths of far too many women

2334471 all my free time has been basically dedicated to searching for her and search activities and getting more information and getting the word out
2334472 im very supportive of the things that people experience when they lose a family member because i know
2334473 she just wanted to be rid of it sex tape
2334474 some guy just pulled up to the curb and gave her five grand was it in a paper bag i dont believe this
2334475 be aware of whats going on in your own community
2334476 were not supposed to go through life fearing things but we do have to be aware
2334477 its cruel but if this is what it took to wake up the community well something goods got to come of it
2334478 this has been very difficult emotionally and its been hard for me to get back into my work i couldnt even go to a recent national gathering because this has affected me so personally
2334479 thats our tradition and culture but people need to know how much violence there is in the community and that its time to speak up and stop it
2334480 tashina would say do you want to go around being bitter
2334481 she didnt know how to hate and she couldnt hold a grudge
2334482 she worked really hard at the pizza shop and had a job with the tourism department
2334483 she learned sign language to help me with one of my grandchildren and often travelled with me when i would go to make presentations in other communities
2334484 the impact of racialized sexualized violence against aboriginal women often leading to their disappearance and death
2334485 the laws have been toughened up and all captains should be aware that they are supposed to inform us of the names of those on tenders taken ashore from yachts in this case the captain of the yacht which was flying a us flag did not inform us and as a result he was fined
2334486 his eternal optimism and complete lack of ego will be a great loss to the climbing community
2334487 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell

2334489 he expected to report 88 cents per share that quarter
2334490 a young inexperienced auditor found issues in our consumer loan review he does not understand the nuances of consumer loans our client has informed me that it is usual that no payments might occur for 5 or 6 months but these loans are generally made to migrant workers picking peas in minnesota and when they come home they will pay off their loans bringing their obligations current

2334539 you wouldnt believe it i got my gas card bill that first month you know it was over 2 000 two thousand bucks man
2334540 swear it didnt get any better either so i took my wifes car to work and she took the navigator but even that damn she was filling it up every week right so its still over 600 you know so we ended up just you know parking it and then we talked about it and i took it back and we traded it for this thing

2334553 greenlands ice sheet represents one of global warmings most disturbing threats the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
2334554 average thinning over the glacier during the summer of 2006 declined to near zero with some apparent thickening in areas on the main trunk
2334555 greenland was about as warm or warmer in the 1930s and 40s and many of the glaciers were smaller than they are now this was a period of rapid glacier shrinkage world wide followed by at least partial re expansion during a colder period from the 1950s to the 1980s of course we dont know very much about how the glacier dynamics changed then because we didnt have satellites to observe it however it does suggest that large variations in ice sheet dynamics can occur from natural climate variability

2334563 regular agricultural trade between greenland and iceland conducted in small open wooden boats
2334564 eliminate the impossible and whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
2334565 greenlands climate began to change as well the summers grew shorter and progressively cooler limiting the time cattle could be kept outdoors and increasing the need for winter fodder during the worst years when rains would have been heaviest the hay crop would barely have been adequate to see the penned animals through the coldest days over the decades the drop in temperature seems to have had an effect on the design of the greenlanders houses originally conceived as single roomed structures like the great hall at brattahlid they were divided into smaller spaces for warmth and then into warrens of interconnected chambers with the cows kept close by so the owners might benefit from the animals body heat
2334566 one valley farm excavated in 1976 and 1977 revealed just how desperate some of the greenlanders had become during a freezing winter the farmers killed and ate their livestock including a newborn calf and lamb leaving the bones and hoofs on the ground even the deerhound probably the companion of many a hunt may have been slaughtered for food one of its leg bones bore the knicks of a knifeblade similar remains were found on another farm but if like their masters the animals were starving their fatless meat would have offered little nourishment
2334567 whoever killed the animals was used to living in squalid conditions the bone littered earthen floors had been spread with an insulating layer of twigs that attracted mice and a variety of insect pests study of the farms ancient insect fauna revealed the remains of flies brought inadvertently from europe the flies were dependent for their survival on the warm environment of the norse houses and on the less than sanitary state of the interiors radiocarbon dating of their remains revealed that they died out suddenly when these conditions ceased to prevail around 1350 presumably when the structures were no longer inhabited some of the rooms had been used as latrines possibly out of habit or because the occupants were reluctant to venture out into the searing cold an ice core drilled from the islands massive icecap between 1992 and 1993 shows a decided cooling off in the western settlement during the mid fourteenth century
2334568 so you can be bothered to respond to what i have written
2334569 lamb 1995 and tkachuck 1983 both refer to old norse burial depths on greenland being much greater in the past than possible today which suggests the permafrost was deeper warmer climate than at present

2334574 hannes alfven might have changed his passport on the basis of your comments
2334575 alfv ns interests encompassed important matters outside science these included nuclear disarmament population growth and the environment
2334576 scientists know for certain that human activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
2334577 scientists do not know anything for certain only the religious have this certainty
2334578 southern elephant seals currently do not have breeding or moulting sites within the ross sea which is considerably south of their primary habitat in the subantarctic in previous work we discovered that the seals once occupied large areas of the victoria land coast at times between about 500 and 7000 years ago we believe that the presence or absence of elephant seals in this region is largely due to the extent and duration of sea ice cover the coast today is locked in land fast ice
2334579 the antarctic is experiencing record high levels of sea ice
2334580 it is certain that co2 as the nominated agent of agw is as dead as a dodo
2334581 declining ice historically high temps hurricanes rising sea level droughts biosphere decline either are plain wrong or have other less apocalyptic causes involved
2334582 the issue here has never been the science this is a philosophical movement with the materialism and excesses of western capialism firmly in its sights
2334583 there is so much ego investment in support of this issue by the commissars that they are not going to let go lightly
2334584 weve seen the censorship the threats the obfuscation and lies and distortions
2334585 we see these along with all the subtle and not so subtle methods of propaganda and agitprop being employed by the agw proponents
2334586 the public is being manipulated into its current state of ignorance and compliance
2334587 i firmly believe that a great number of the agw supporters have no idea of how disruptive the effects of proposed agw measures will be
2334588 which part of the increase in co2 is due to human activities the best figures put this at about 3 of the total
2334589 fishing communities in the worlds high latitudes as well as those that rely on coral reef systems will be most exposed to the impact of climate change fisheries located in deltas coral atolls and ice dominated coasts will be vulnerable to flooding and coastal erosion because of rises in sea level fao says that some 42 million people work directly in the fishing sector the great majority in developing countries counting in those who work in processing supply marketing and distribution the fishing industry supports several hundred million jobs aquatic foods have high nutritional quality contributing 20 r more of average per capita animal protein intake for more than 2 8 billion people again mostly in developing countries fish is also the worlds most widely traded foodstuff and a key source of export earnings for many poorer countries the sector has particular significance for small island states
2334590 if oceanic cyanobacterial primary productivity is rising in response to rising atmospheric co2 which all indication are that it is it follows by definition that the human food productivity of the oceans is also rising in line with agw
2334591 james did hansen predict that bangladesh would lose land mass
2334592 according to hansen large areas of florida east anglia and the netherlands as well as many oceanic islands and most of bangladesh could be inundated within the lifetime of children now being born
2334593 the changes in seawater chemistry that we project to occur during this century could have severe consequences for calcifying organisms particularly shelled pteropods the major planktonic producers of aragonite pteropod population densities are high in polar and subpolar waters yet only five species typically occur in such cold water regions and of these only one or two species are common at the highest latitudes31 high latitude pteropods have one or two generations per year12 15 32 form integral components of food webs and are typically found in the upper 300m where they may reach densities of hundreds to thousands of individuals per m3 refs 11 13 15 in the ross sea for example the prominent subpolar polar pteropod limacina helicina sometimes replaces krill as the dominant zooplankton and is considered an overall indicator of ecosystem health33 in the strongly seasonal high latitudes sedimentation pulses of pteropods frequently occur just after summer15 34 in the ross sea pteropods account for the majority of the annual export flux of both carbonate and organic carbon34 35 south of the antarctic polar front pteropods also dominate the export flux of caco3 ref 36 pteropods may be unable to maintain shells in waters that are undersaturated with respect to aragonite
2334594 you are arguing for something that the ipcc has not stated
2334595 the silt coming down a river has nothing to do with whether sea levels rise or not
2334596 to claim that the ipcc and hansen are liars is amazing
2334597 the antarctic is experiencing record high levels of sea ice this does not address the issue of agw what matters is the temperature not the sea ice
2334598 more important is the logical implication of your observation that temperatures at some time in the past have been higher this is absolutely true the problem is that your observation has no predictive value
2334599 doesnt seem to believe that there is danger to the pteropods either
2334600 was bangladesh underwater between the years 1000 and 1450 ish
2334601 we have already established that the mwp existed was global in nature
2334602 un rushes aid as unexpected cold spell threatens peruvian livestock
2334603 this year the cold arrived well ahead of the usual season in march and april instead of june and many small scale farmers have not been able to harvest their crops
2334604 the gravity of the situation has led the peruvian government to declare a state of emergency in 11 of the countrys 25 provinces
2334605 so a reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the planet leads to a weaker equator to pole heating difference and therefore slower winds the effect on surface temperatures is particularly large in winter because the oceans are relatively warm during the winter due to their large heat storage the diminished flow creates a cold land warm ocean pattern by reducing the transport of warm oceanic air to the continents and vice versa
2334606 btw steve short you mentioned that atmospheric concentrations of co2 are increasing by 0 45 per year but ipcc ar4 chapter 2 page 137 cites 1 4 ppm per year increase in atmospheric co2 which is only 0 37 and their figure for human emissions of carbon figure 2 3 looks like a growth rate of about 8 per year go figure perhaps ive misinterpreted something
2334607 pteropods may be unable to maintain shells in waters that are undersaturated with respect to aragonite
2334608 not that i care but is there anyone who you guys would consider as a reasonable source for a critique of agw
2334609 incidentally you could have posted those numbers on here to make your point so i suspect as you have not corrected the numbers i posted i assume they must be correct
2334610 how is it possible to have rising sea levels and growing coastlines
2334611 the fact that temperatures have often been warmer in the holocene past reveals that our current situation is within interglacial normal variation
2334612 agw supporters have repeatedly claimed that we are well above natural temperature variations and that an apocalypse will occur within our lifetimes
2334613 it also shows that todays temperature can be accounted for without the apparatus of agw theory
2334614 lefties only fratenise with their own kind so all they hear are confirmations of their own beliefs because they avoid socialising with us they never get to experience different takes on a topic they believe they are normal and we not i hate to say it but i suspect they are sociopaths
2334615 global warming is taught as a strand in the social sciences and not the physical sciences
2334616 here is hansen predicting that all of bangladesh would be under the indian ocean
2334617 it is impossible to say at exactly what level of global warming the rate of sea level rise could accelerate to meters per century because ice sheet disintegration is a very non linear process in which changes can occur suddenly but paleoclimate data suggests that we are not far from such a level of global warming
2334618 cambodia bali java china japan north american indian oceania and part of africa all were in high renaissance mode culturally during the mwp when according to the ipcc they should have been experiencing mass starvation water shortages and mass migration and war due to global warming
2334619 there is as much more evidence of violations of intellectual integrity among the opponents of agw utter unmitigated garbage give one
2334620 cathy zoi has spent two decades in the energy and environmental sectors in both the united states and australia in february 2007 she joined the alliance for climate protection as its founding ceo in palo alto california the alliance established and chaired by former vice president al gore is spearheading a massive campaign to persuade americans and people elsewhere in the world of both the urgency and solvability of the climate crisis
2334621 cathy served as chair of the board at the climate institute a nonprofit australian organization whose purpose is to focus public attention on the impact and importance of climate change she was a member of the international climate change taskforce icct a coalition of policymakers business leaders scientists and non governmental organizations from britain australia and the united states launched in 2004 icct formulated a climate change strategy that went beyond the kyoto protocol and made specific recommendations to member governments in january 2005
2334622 prior to joining bayard cathy was assistant director general of the new south wales epa she co chaired the sustainability advisory council and was the founding ceo of the sustainable energy development authority a 50 million fund to commercialize greenhouse friendly technology landmark efforts during her tenure included the first nationwide green power program 1997 and the worlds largest solar powered suburb 1998 cathy has served on boards and advisory committees of a variety of companies in the clean technology sector
2334623 prior to her move to australia cathy served as chief of staff in the white house office on environmental policy in the clinton gore administration where she managed the staff working on environmental and energy issues she was also a manager at the us environmental protection agency where she pioneered the energy star program previously she worked as an energy analyst at icf incorporated and pacific gas amp electric company
2334624 actually that would be a chore because the ipcc doesnt see any need to name their reviewers amazing amount of hubris isnt it
2334625 ill remind chris that bangladesh is adding land at a rate of 2000 square kilometres per century
2334626 when were getting thousands of signatures theres no way of filtering out a fake
2334627 all of their references predate the oregon petition 31 000 scientists that we are talking
2334628 i was shocked not really that those methodical fact checkers at wiki included deltoid and real climate as credible sources
2334629 something has to be done about wikipedia if only to alert people to its zealots disparagers slanderers graduate student editors some useful information a great deal of misinformation universities generally will not accept wikipedia as a valid reference but it is approaching 20 million hits a day so it does has an impact on our society how do you handle a non refereed non peer reviewed blog site that usually comes up first on any search
2334630 wikipedia cannot be considered a credible reference source especially on matters associated with anthropogenic global warming issues
2334631 wes george offers the argument that antarctic sea ice is the best proxy for antarctic temperatures i disagree
2334632 the fact that a phenomenon lies within the range of past variation does not justify our dismissing that phenomenon as natural
2334633 if a forest fire destroys my home does the existence of lightning as a possible cause for forest fires mean that the fire in question was not started by a human
2334634 its original form was subject to inadequate checking which is why the organisers have revamped the validation procedure
2334635 the ipcc can find no substantial evidence for significant warming in antarctica
2334636 that may change as more evidence is collated then again it might not
2334637 the fact that todays climate is cooler than the mwp renders the agw hypothesis superfluous by showing that we are well with natural climate variation for an interglacial warming period
2334638 to claim otherwise is to see a horse like animal with black and white stripes and assume that some evil capitalist must have painted the poor creature rather than think it might be a naturally occurring ungulate
2334639 the only strongly supportive evidence for the agw hypothesis is from gcms based on unproven assumptions of climate sensitivity to co2
2334640 take patrick michaels birthdate its either wrong or right what is there to discuss about it
2334641 what do points 5 7 say about validation of duplicate names forgeries and deaths what validation would you consider adequate
2334642 steve short you write that i have misinterpreted the data but you arent addressing the fact that im citing a different source the ipcc ar4 chapter 2 page 137 cites a figure of 1 4 ppm year increase in co2 for the period 1960 2000 you instead cite the noaa data on this it appears that there is a disagreement between the two sources i dont want to make a federal case out of this conflict i was curious as to your thoughts on it
2334643 proto history and pre history geological evidence indicates that much of bangladesh was formed 1 to 6 5 million years ago during the tertiary era human habitation in this region is therefore likely to be very old the implements discovered in deolpota village in the neighbouring state of west bengal suggest that paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago
2334644 ivan cites the cold spell in peru i remind ivan weather is not climate
2334645 in your analysis on your questioning climate blog you first removed the linear trend from the global and mlo mauna loa records for the selected interval
2334646 so that same holocene warming became a cooling and is now a warming again theres something very mixed up in your logic here
2334647 yes its true that holocene warming could explain current warming but for the fact that the current round of warming appears to be much steeper than most previous warmings
2334648 more important however is the fact that the greenhouse effect is a well established phenomenon and it could just as well be the cause of the current warming
2334649 the principle states that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible eliminating those that make no difference in the observable predictions of the explanatory hypothesis or theory
2334650 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best
2334651 you cant simply dismiss the greenhouse effect as a cause merely because there are other possible causes
2334652 i find these two sources credible in matters of climatology
2334653 so no i have not slandered anybody and i have nothing to retract
2334654 indeed if you look at the last 1200 years see figure 6
2334655 the one thing they dont show however and its a very telling point they do not show any of the signers of the current 32 000 scientists and counting oregon petition misrepresenting themselves
2334656 12th subaru of dallas dfw championship series presented by quiznossub sister grove race sport clydesdale men 40 99
2334657 steve i can suggest two possible factors first is the 1991 pinatubo eruption which might be a factor in the decrease from 1992 2 to 1998 2 the timing isnt perfect but its a possibility second is the fact that anthropogenic emissions of co2 are rising sharply have you tried a fit with figure 2 3 of ipcc ar4
2334658 complex statistical manipulation that massages the temp change right out of existence
2334659 well reasoned and careful in its statements of the degrees of certainty it has for its many conclusions
2334660 ivan i think you misunderstand the line of reasoning that has been followed so far with respect to bangladesh
2334661 simple hansen says that sea levels are rising because global warming is melting the polar icecaps this flooding will inundate bangladesh therefore according to this logic bangladesh must have been flooded during the mwp given that the mwp is not part of the agw catechism
2334662 simply because most of bangladesh is at an altitude of less that 25 meters
2334663 now you come along and note that there were parts of bangladesh that werent underwater
2334664 next ivan defends his weather climate conflation by pointing out that some agw adherents do it too ivan two wrongs dont make a right so why dont we just agree up front that weather is not climate and we dont accept weather arguments as indicating anything significant about climate ok
2334665 basically i make only comments on whales birds other animals and fisheries
2334666 the reason might be the biosphere in the ocean around
2334667 he further said that some of these changes are permanent
2334668 read the executive summary on pp131 132 where their degrees of certainty for clouds and h2o are non existent
2334669 the rf due to the cloud albedo effect also referred to as first indirect or twomey effect in the context of liquid water clouds is estimated to be 0 7 1 1 0 4 w m 2 with a low level of scientific understanding
2334670 check faq 3 1 where their concept of the enhanced greenhouse absolutely depends on a defined and predictable feedback from h2o
2334671 therefore according to this logic mr hansens bangladesh must have been flooded during the mwp given that the mwp is not part of the agw catechism
2334672 i can see why you didnt provide the link to your verbally described graphic
2334673 its a carbon copy of the sudden jump in temp in 950 ad perhaps bit stronger because of the natural bias of the ipcc bureaucracy is to justify their continued funding it would not be in the ipccs vested interest to paint the mwp as much warmer than today
2334674 it was warmer in 950 ad than today so the 950 ad temperature peak of the ipcc graphic 6 10 is too low
2334675 i see no intellectual value in that tedious exercise no moral merit in doing so and hence will not waste my time jumping through your hoop
2334676 your observation that temperatures at some time in the past have been higher this is absolutely true
2334677 that the current round of warming appears to be much steeper than most previous warmings
2334678 however these simple thermodynamic calculations suffice to show just how implausible suggestions that marine species which deposit biogenic aragonite are likely to be threatened any time soon
2334679 if they cant live without a shell then low saturation levels preventing them building a shell would be fatal for them anyway would it not
2334680 weve shown as well as one can on a blog that it was warmer during the mwp than today
2334681 weve shown that todays climate can be explained by natural interglacial variation and that we are well with in the climate norms
2334682 what you now demand is that we prove that agw doesnt exist
2334683 even if your saturation index arguments are correct it would make little difference if low carbonate saturation states make it impossible for some corals to continue building shells at a rate that will exceed natural mechanical erosion same argument for pteropods if they cant live without a shell then low saturation levels preventing them building a shell would be fatal for them anyway would it not
2334684 four corners journeys to the arctic circle to explore how the melt is challenging human understanding of global warming the four corners team joins scientists on board a canadian icebreaker louis s st laurent as they scout for icebergs bears and evidence of a changing seascape across the scientific community there is a quest for answers how fast is the melt happening is it stoppable what may be lost what riches will be unlocked how much global warming is caused by people and how much by nature
2334685 sorry shorty other excuses like softened shelly creatures wandering about the seas looking for new places to die wont do either our adult majority while hoping there no problems ahead now expects governments of all persuasions to do a lot more than wait it out
2334686 note that there was an article by the co2science people a suspect source if ever there was one which
2334687 lastly on the issue of weather versus climate you argue that the wmo makes this mistake fine the important thing is that we both agree that weather is not climate and that neither one of us should make statements confusing the two ok
2334688 this year the cold arrived well ahead of the usual season in march and april instead of june and many small scale farmers have not been able to harvest their crops
2334689 the central netherlands temperature is now about 1 5 c higher than in 1950
2334690 your whole argument has degenerated into an attempt to invert the burden of proof
2334691 i say ivan remains in the cheer squad because he cant help himself
2334692 nothing mysterious at all london to a brick they all work for ago
2334693 louis this will be front page news at the smh tommorrow
2334694 the last ice age 13 000 years ago took hold in just one year more than ten times quicker than previously believed scientists have warned
2334695 rather than a gradual cooling over a decade the ice age plunged europe into the deep freeze german research centre for geosciences at potsdam said
2334696 two temperature records were set or tied in july in great falls including one dating back more than a century according to the national weather service an overnight low of 39 degrees on july 11 broke the daily record of 40 degrees set in 1897 said ed kurdy hydro meteorological technician with the weather service
2334697 if this carries on for the next few months then its the death knell for agw
2334698 youd damn well better be really certain of anything you put into a report
2334699 the most striking evidence of a global warming trend is closely scrutinized data that show a relatively rapid and widespread increase in temperature during the past century the rising temperatures observed since 1978 are particularly noteworthy because the rate of increase is so high and because during the same period the energy reaching the earth from the sun had been measured precisely enough to conclude that earths warming was not due to changes in the sun scientists find clear evidence of this warming trend even after removing data from urban areas where an urban heat island effect could influence temperature readings furthermore the data are consistent with other evidence of warming such as increases in ocean temperatures shrinking mountain glaciers and decreasing polar ice cover
2334700 changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities
2334701 but the single most important evidence in support of the agw hypothesis is not the absolute value of the temperature but the rate of change of temperature
2334702 but if you really want to get down to something substantial you need look no further than this snip its the summary from the us national academy of sciences regarding climate change let me tell you a little bit about the nas it was created by the us congress in the 1860s to provide the government with expert advice on scientific matters as they pertained to public policy the nas is truly an elite organization consisting of the very best american scientists to be invited to join the nas is a major career plum blah blah blah
2334703 if this carries on for the next few months then its the death knell for agw
2334704 stick to the issue at hand and dispense with the attempts at distraction
2334705 especially his chriss outrage that anyone dare question the ipccs absolute authority
2334706 you have proved nothing the burden of proof is on you to show that agw is a real phenomenon you posited something exists weve shown a simpler explanation for the observed data exists than the complex group of assumptions you present
2334707 well yes crawford presents the better case but he hasnt really been tested i want to see somebody really hit him hard with a substantial argument
2334708 so cut to the chase and show your hand of evidence for agw i call you
2334709 chris i think agw is forcing todays climate wes i invoke the principle of parsimony what is your proof chris you cant prove that agw doesnt exist therefore it must
2334710 that is the same argument john wheeler basically used to bolster support for astronomical black holes you cant prove they dont exist so i am free to use them
2334711 nobody engaged in worthwhile science subscribes to this agw horse hit it would therefore have to be the 2nd and 3rd rate ones that can only land a job in the sheltered workshop
2334712 the indicator for this will be hansen pulling his old 1970s
2334713 oh look more cold records being set in montana in july
2334714 well this famous actor says that global warming is a crock
2334715 albert einstein says that the earth takes 400 days to orbit the sun
2334716 were right because the vast majority of scientist have been looking at this and they never brought up blah blah blah
2334717 if trees indeed achieve temperature equilibrium after a 24 hour period as you suggest why have i never seen a tree freeze to death
2334718 mark offers a link to a graph he doesnt say anything about that graph yes mark its a pretty graph do you have a point youd like to make
2334719 but the single most important evidence in support of the agw hypothesis is not the absolute value of the temperature but the rate of change of temperature
2334720 but the single most important evidence in support of the agw hypothesis is not the absolute value of the temperature but the rate of change of temperature
2334721 if this carries on for the next few months then its the death knell for agw
2334722 but you continue as do all agw supporters to avoid dealing with the fundamental principle does an increase in atmospheric co2 actually cause a temperature rise or if atmospheric co2 decreases a cooling of temperature since the two processes go hand in hand
2334723 as for myself i consider the issue at hand to be this
2334724 in the country of the blind the one eyed man is king
2334725 inspite of my lack his argument makes sense to me because it doesnt depend upon a title be it phd or ma or member of such and such society being affixed to the end of his name
2334726 however that wont work here as most of the resident participants here who like to challenge the agw myth are kind of partial to facts and not made up shit
2334727 my goal is not to convince you but to convince readers who havent already made up their minds
2334728 we dont have any proxies for global temperature that can tell us how fast the climate has changed in the past over 30 year periods this means you have no data which allows you to make such a claim i say 30 years because the warming to 1940 is generally accepted as natural and there was no warming from 1940 to 1980 so the entire agw arguement is based on less than 30 years of data
2334729 the proxies that we do have such as the ice core records show numerous 100 year periods during the last 10000 years where the rate of change is as high as or higher than the last 100 years
2334730 several writers on a number of occasions have accused me of demanding that they prove agw wrong their accusations are false i have never made any such demand
2334731 this may be true of some proponents of agw but it is most certainly not the concern of all proponents moreover its irrelevant if theyre right for the wrong reasons theyre still right you need to prove they are wrong not that they have the wrong motivations
2334732 if theyre right for the wrong reason theyre still right
2334733 any honest man who knows his own expertise to be significantly less than that of an authority will give great credence to the advice of that authority and i think that many of the opponents of agw are vulnerable to the accusation of vainglory in this regard i have no idea whether that criticism can be applied to any of the individuals commenting on this blog but i can state with confidence that a person who casually dismisses the conclusions of experts who have invested many years of education and hard work in their field when he himself has not made a comparable investment in time and exertion in that field is intellectually dishonest
2334734 invested many years of education and hard work in the field
2334735 yep id walk er a million miles for one of your wiles no matter how deplaurable ad libbable or downwright terrible you poor little debble trebble or whatever your name is
2334736 i refer you to my comment at august 5 4 19 am
2334737 as for myself i consider the issue at hand to be this
2334738 louis protests that i have not demonstrated that his claim that i claim that he must disprove agw and i dont have to prove agw is false
2334739 there are only two periods of which i am aware that show rapid increases in temperature in the first warming before the younger dryas warming and in the immediate aftermath of the younger dryas
2334740 happy to have all manner of cutesy private conversations off line which im not going to discuss
2334741 the issue here has never been the science this is a philosophical movement with the materialism and excesses of western capialism firmly in its sights
2334742 wes george must prove hansens claim that bangladesh wont flood in the next 30 years by proving it wasnt underwater in the much warmer mwp in fact the case is quite the opposite
2334743 chris the whole gestalt of your argument is based on inverting the burden of proof upon us
2334744 at this point in the debate is it fair to assume that you can not prove that agw is forcing the observed climate change of today
2334745 in very significant aspects the agw movement represents a real repudiation of the rationality of the enlightenment and its replacement with a process of enforced perpetual re education mao style
2334746 the splenic posturing and vainglory of the more rabid acolytes of the global agw movement who post here or indeed of some of their opponents concern me not at all it is so easily discerned very often quite amusing and satirized viz
2334747 if the public misunderstands we cant fix the problem by lying
2334748 you regard it as a given that the agw hypothesis is a scientific theory it isnt hence the rest of your deductions while logical are meaningless if the primary assumption is wrong
2334749 oh and i did not complain that agw was a leftwing prelidection i justed stated it as a fact
2334750 raven i think i can explain the discrepancy you note youre looking only at polar temperatures im talking about global mean temperatures theres a huge difference between the two
2334751 chris your ad hom about my mwp sources is not reasonable
2334752 i note you have been flirting with the greenhouse concept with your house analogy it only works if the house is neck high in water the greenhouse along with ave temp and uniform co2 mixing as essential aspects of agw are rubbish
2334753 then that takes us back to my orginal point about the lack of data we simply do not have any proxies for the gmst with the precision required to support your claim that the current rate of warming is unusual
2334754 the formation of public opinion is still largely independent of the internet and its string of like forums
2334755 i shall therefore stipulate note that verb stipulate that mwp temperatures were slightly warmer than temperatures in the year 2000
2334756 i shall therefore stipulate note that verb stipulate that mwp temperatures were slightly warmer than temperatures in the year 2000
2334757 do you reject ipcc ar4 figure 6 10 thats the single best source in my opinion on overall global temperatures
2334758 so luke laura libby gavin trebble brian holland bespectacled funnel web bibble bubble or whoever or whatever avatar or collectively in this always unlinkable little cabel of public service weasels you may actually be keep your rat dirt to yourself
2334759 mark there are a number of flaws in your reasoning blah blah blah
2334760 do you reject ipcc ar4 figure 6 10 thats the single best source in my opinion on overall global temperatures
2334761 do you think that the people attacking the agw hypothesis are doing so out of a concern for scientific truth or because they have a political axe to grind if their concern is purely scientific why arent they addressing other controversies in science such as the raging controversy in linguistics over chomsky and deep structure or the role of dark matter in cosmology or the possibility of life on mars or earths magnetic field reversals or fine structure of meteoroid streams or any of a million other controversies why do they pick this particular scientific issue and why do they make such strong statements and such abusive comments about those who disagree with them about a merely scientific question
2334762 will you do us the favour of actually understanding the scientific basis of agw its based on arrhenius paper of 1906 its an hypothesis that has not been proven keeling and others subsequently used the idea of co2 causing heating to form the agw hypothesis that is agw is an idea cantilevered onto an unproven hypothesis this is why it is not worthy of consideration scientifically
2334763 agw could not have even kicked in until the 1940s
2334764 the main argument for agw has always been manns famous hockey stick temperature reconstruction that was later discredited as false
2334765 it would be good to push through and dispense with the tedious and predictable political and philosophical tirades
2334766 the co2 molecule has an absorption band in the infrared
2334767 the only time i have ever addressed anything by you and received no response at the time is when you assumed that no one else here blah blah
2334768 this is standard material that has been taught for decades your questioning it is just bizarre youre welcome to simply dismiss physics as a pseudo science but i dont think youll convince many people of your belief
2334769 i have never relied on manns hockey stick temperature reconstruction
2334770 the line for the mwp you wes drew on the graph starts at a low of 0 4 c in 900 ad and climbs to a high of 0 0 c in 1000 ad
2334771 i shall therefore stipulate that mwp temperatures were slightly warmer than temperatures in the year 2000
2334772 lets suppose that overall world temperatures were indeed higher than they are today what are the implications of that supposition normally i proceed from the data to the conclusions
2334773 your so called i have ever addressed was simply a personal attack based on your perception of my assumptions but in turn that is simply your interpretation
2334774 i couldnt respond to you at the time because there was absolutely nothing of any technical substance in your post to respond to
2334775 if you simply confine your posts to discussing rebutting technical claims pertinent to the thread and or providing interesting information or data from your own sources or scientific background such as e g chris crawford cohenite or jan pompe does then there will only be concrete non personal issues to reply to
2334776 discussing rebutting technical claims pertinent to the thread and or providing interesting information or data from your own sources or scientific background
2334777 chris give it up the people posting here subscribe to an alternative science one where the greenhouse effect doesnt exist
2334778 and steve if you didnt feel the need to smear people here and make grandiose
2334779 agw is a theory they use models to produce theoretical results which support the theory
2334780 agw is based on the physics of greenhouse gases so is based on the greenhouse effect it doesnt need models
2334781 also you need to define what you mean by an
2334782 two newly identified types of killer whales that hunt prey off of antarctic sea ice risk losing food sources to global warming and melting according to a new study on the whales movement patterns
2334783 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover in the antarctic then it means there are going to be changes in the amount of habitat that the whales have available to them
2334784 and were not sure how adaptable they are to living in a different kind of habitat
2334785 your second statement is qualitative you need to make it quantitative
2334786 the man on the moon caper was more of an engineering feat
2334787 economic theories are similar the modelling isnt there to serve the theory but rather attempt to investigate outcomes
2334788 and there is no sign of solar cycle no 25 getting underway
2334789 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover
2334790 i have already seen something somewhere about temperatures in central england and have found tamino does an analysis of it and there does indeed appear to be a hefty rise in the early 18th century dont know how good the data is or exactly how the estimates were done

2334800 yips approach to photography is not that of the photo journalist who must make news nor the fashion photographer who must flatter nor the industrial photographer who must explain nor the publicity photographer who must be an image maker his is the artists approach free of the functional constraints and yet must reach out for something else yip decides to express a fragment of his imagination
2334801 understood how photography can be a great medium not just to record truth and beauty but to capture the defining moments of the changes that affect all of us in any human situation and to interpret the dynamic interplay of the elements that constitute life and the human spirit

2334805 if we read a burden of anxiety upon a face we understand full well that yips childhood was not an unblemished one if we read the light of innocence and imagination upon a face then we know yips experiences bore the same if not as a child himself then as that within his own children all six of them if we catch the outbreak of happiness through smiles and laughter we know that this kind of joy is not limited to heady childhood but lives on well into old age

2334813 a man of great humanity and compassion a man who lived life to the fullest a man dedicated to his profession his country and his people
2334814 politics was an accident i was thrust into politics by a sense of outrage a deep sense of anger
2334815 i used to resent little pin pricks which were i thought unfair about you know the white man brown man relationship
2334816 like you call me jowdy jew brush my shoe and next thing i know is i hit you on the nose i wanted to break the sonic barrier against asians and especially against jews
2334817 frankly looking back i consider that reading the bible was perhaps the most formative aspect of my character because the king james version has an organ sonority of language which sank into me at a very impressionable age and also the wonderful stories of a heroic global view of life and passionate dedication to human rights that you find in the bible it appealed to me very much
2334818 of course i have known cruelty before but wide spread long term cold blooded permanent cruelty ive never experienced before not even from the british imperialists no matter how arrogant they were that was a major shock the feeling that here were human beings who were not on the same wavelength as me at all who were not even human from my point of view
2334819 the cohesion of disparate prisoners from different parts of the united kingdom from different parts of europe was something touching there were some egoists who cracked under pressure there were some who even committed suicide because they couldnt take any more
2334820 but by and large there was an unspoken comradeship it kept the humanity alive within me and made me perhaps recognize more clearly that great qualities qualities that i appreciated in human beings were not necessarily confined to the wealthy or educated that the rough semi educated laborer odd jobs man had human qualities which were good and which felt good and which were of value to its fellow prisoners where some of the educated and intelligent cracked up or went about whining
2334821 perhaps i learnt most of all the frailty of human beings the absurdities of the status symbols of carrying a captains star or a majors crown and turning out to be a long streak of piss whereas the cook who was the lance corporal turned out to be a really worthwhile human being
2334822 my understanding of socialism my own approach was an effort to create the foundations for the opportunity of all our people to attain the conditions of living compatible with human dignity why did i call it socialist because it moved away from the concept of wealth to the concept of human qualities and respect for the human individual and not respect for his bank account
2334823 i think its very important to make the distinction today between intelligence and wisdom when there is so much emphasis on the genetic inheritance of intelligence
2334824 because intelligence requires seems to compel an egoistic approach an egocentric approach to life
2334825 the wisdom of centuries which are stored in the treasure house of religion and ancient philosophies of need for an understanding of the unity of humanity cooperation with fellow beings
2334826 god and the devil can live alone but man needs his fellow man
2334827 we in singapore have the constant drum beat now for productivity
2334828 were not seen to be able to contribute to the finer graces of living but we are viewed as economic animals with the same awe as we view robots its a question of recognizing that work is an integral part of individual identity and essential for true enjoyment of living but concurrently to recognize that work is not the only element in living that there are other elements to life the joy of children the joy of marriage the pleasure of travel the pleasure of study life is such a miracle it is multi faceted in the opportunities it gives for the uplift of the human spirit

2334857 people are being killed every day being imprisoned for just standing up for human rights
2334858 we are here to voice our opinion and to speak out and to let the world know that china is using the olympics for propaganda and they are trying to whitewash their worsening human rights record
2334859 we are free country before and we will be free someday

2334865 shes a very outgoing girl a lot of after school activities i know she was a cheerleader its kind of a big shock
2334866 when i had walked in there she was in an argument with one of our friends and i didnt get to say hi to her because i didnt want to interrupt cause they were in an argument and she left right after that
2334867 its not a very well lit road so i think it mightve been an accident
2334868 whoever did hit her though the right thing would be to come forward and admit to it her familys probably really worried about what exactly happened because nobody really knows right now
2334869 you havent seen the dark knight unless youve seen it in imax

2334879 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the online gaming market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong online gaming usa companies that move forward
2334880 im getting calls from online gaming industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular online gaming company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
2334881 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other online gaming entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
2334882 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
2334883 im pleased to report that technological advances by riggens barrera inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most online gaming related companies and their subsidiaries
2334884 output of online gaming related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
2334885 the recent news in the online gaming industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
2334886 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
2334887 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
2334888 as with any advance in online gaming technology it is inevitable that some jobs will be lost but eventually demand for labor will increase in other areas

2334904 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame its a fantastic golf course but there is no need to play it as it is
2334905 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2334906 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well

2334930 the certification is a mechanism to avoid the slide towards deforestation

2334941 the cites decision is a serious setback to elephant conservation which may trigger renewed poaching for ivory in the country
2334942 india is more vulnerable since there are few tuskers in asian elephants only the male has tusks the skewed sex ratio of elephants has been a serious concern already
2334943 when japan was allowed to lift ivory stocks from these countries in 1999 we saw an increase in elephant poaching in the country
2334944 we may witness the same situation in the near future the real danger is that the small number of tuskers could be wiped out unless we have a plan to counter this
2334945 his presence in the lineup means a lot to us in different ways

2334957 it is important to ensure that research work is only published once if it is published more than once the scientific literature can be unjustifiably weighted by the appearance that one study has been replicated it might also mean that the study is inadvertently entered twice into a meta analysis for example or cause problems in systems which use the number of publications to assess an individuals or an institutes research output
2334958 if it is published more than once the scientific literature can be unjustifiably weighted by the appearance that one study has been replicated

2334960 i wish steve well but thank him for establishing that he we are dealing with the worst form of shonkademic scum once again it undermines every piece of so called peer reviewed literature ever published in science or nature
2334961 you seem unaware of the problems steve mcintyre had with this journal in terms of data archiving etc

2335007 if you can catch that kid at 13 and 14 maybe they wont have a life on the street at 16 17 and 18 and be crack addicted but theres nothing theres just a big big gap
2335008 a missing child who is taken from their home or just disappears off the street is a major interest
2335009 a missing child who is working as a sex worker or working the street doesnt seem to have that reaction

2335013 the olympic games are tibets biggest chance to focus world attention on what is happening in tibet and to campaign for an end to the occupation
2335014 once the games are over attention will be switched elsewhere we have to keep up the pressure weve also got to keep it going after the games end
2335015 the games have brought a growing awareness of what is happening in tibet just possessing a tibetan flag is punishable by imprisonment and so is displaying a photograph of the tibetans spiritual leader the dalai lama

2335028 visitors say what makes arrowtown special is the character of the main street and the feeling of history
2335029 people are keen to preserve the historic character they are very sensitive about it the strict heritage controls that are now in the district plan came from the people
2335030 there is a lesson to other towns look after your history the department of conservation and the historic places trust and the council worked together but the key is the community cares it put the controls in place there is a good community base and people care about the town

2335036 the ppmns action fund board engaged in a thoughtful and thorough screening process for endorsement in the u s senate race we believe al franken is the u s senate candidate that minnesota women and families can count on to protect and strengthen their health and rights we know that al franken will stand with minnesotans on reproductive health and on affordable and quality health care for all
2335037 this election will be critical to women and families and we look forward to the opportunity to replace the status quo with a u s senator from minnesota that is clear in his commitment to the health and safety of women
2335038 along with the endorsement of al franken the planned parenthood minnesota north dakota south dakota action fund will be educating voters in minnesota about senator norm colemans atrocious record on issues of importance to women especially health care and their right to privacy
2335039 colemans voting record and position on womens health is dangerously out of touch with the majority of minnesota voters ppmns action fund will make sure that voters in the state know exactly what colemans record is

2335053 are you jealous for my sake i wish that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit on them
2335054 it is not for you to know the times or dates the father has set by his own authority but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
2335055 if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare
2335056 for we know brothers loved by god that he has chosen you because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the holy spirit and with deep conviction
2335057 my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirits power so that your faith might not rest on mens wisdom but on gods power
2335058 do not put out the spirits fire do not treat prophecies with contempt test everything hold on to the good avoid every kind of evil

2335083 its a very positive outcome considering most of the regions throughout new zealand are starting to experience decreases in economic activity
2335084 the question is whether there are effective changes that can be made that will affect the price when you see the price is largely dictated from overseas there is nothing that can be done about that

2335093 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him

2335205 conversations that cut across traditional boundaries of disciplines spheres of responsibility geography as a key condition
2335206 desiring to work on interdisciplinary problems to immerse themselves in the languages cultures and knowledge of their collaborators
2335207 we conclude that chemists and chemical engineers need to be prepared to work increasingly in multidisciplinary teams and that this will change the way we educate future chemical scientists
2335208 real world problems are rarely defined along narrow disciplinary lines undergraduate students would benefit from at least cursory learning about the interplay of disciplines embodied in such problems thus we recommend that engineering schools should introduce interdisciplinary learning in the undergraduate environment

2335219 todays challenge is economic no pearl harbor sputnik or 9 11 will stir quick action it is time to shore up the basics the blocking and tackling without which our nations leadership will surely decline for a century many in the united states took for granted that most great inventions were homegrown and were commercialized here as well we are less certain today who will create the next generation of innovations or even what they will be we know that we need a more secure internet more efficient transportation new cures for disease and clean affordable and reliable sources of energy but who will dream them up who will get the jobs they create and who will profit from them if our children and grandchildren are to enjoy the prosperity that our forebears earned for us our nation must quickly invigorate the knowledge institutions that have served it so well in the past and create new ones to serve in the future
2335220 institutional policies and practices should systematically plan the allocation of resources to favor programs and facilities in areas that are central to the institutions mission of education and that offer the best opportunities to achieve distinction

2335379 we all expect this system to work but it doesnt we expect that when a judge finds someone guilty he is but that just isnt the case

2335396 the question who is an evangelical involves a much broader picture and the guy who has been talking about faith is obama
2335397 i think the senators political team or whoevers making the decision was smart to associate him with warren it suggests that there are evangelical moderates that they can work with or reach or maybe even attract their votes
2335398 there is one camp in evangelicalism who truly want to follow jesus and another much narrower the christian political power brokers who want to follow conservative politics

2335444 we know however that the agro ecological approach to farming using traditional and organic methods provides the real solutions to the crises that we face studies show that a biodiversity based organic agriculture working with nature and not against it and using a diversity of mixed crops produces higher overall yields at far lower costs than chemical agriculture a 2002 study by the international centre for research on agro forestry icraf showed that southern african farms using traditional agro forestry techniques did not suffer from the drought that hit the region so severely that year

2335460 1 la figura es antropomorfa en un negativo fotogr fico aparece dotada de un alto grado de naturalismo y no hay distorsiones geom tricas demasiado evidentes como ocurrir a si la imagen hubiera envuelto alguna vez un cad ver
2335461 2 es monocrom tica marr n sepia amarillento y tiene una gran dispersi n tonal es decir entre la zona m s oscura y la m s clara hay muchos niveles de color intermedios otra peculiaridad son sus quemaduras debidas a la ca da de gotas de plata derretida que formaron zonas negras y otras del mismo color sepia de la imagen
2335462 3 la dispersi n tonal est relacionada con la distancia de la tela al cuerpo oscura en nariz cabellos arco cigom tico boca bigote y barbilla d bil debajo de los ojos a los lados de la nariz y en las zonas laterales entre rostro y melena esa relaci n tono distancia permite una burda reconstrucci n tridimensional de la imagen
2335463 debo recordarles que la supuesta tridimensionalidad se limita a que la imagen es m s oscura en los puntos donde la s bana ha estado m s cerca del cuerpo y m s clara donde ha estado m s lejos eso es todo
2335464 la dispersi n tonal est relacionada con la distancia de la tela al cuerpo oscura en nariz cabellos
2335465 4 la marca es indeleble no hay ning n documento que nos diga si esto fue pretendido o es un producto secundario de su realizaci n

2335473 al final del capitulo junto con un experto en computadores intentan ver la tridimensionalidad defendida por el sturp y llegan a la conclusion de que es una farsa ellos se han tomado un trabajo inmenso para demostrarlo la verdad es que bastaba leer el articulo original de jacksoniv para ver que todo el rollo del vp 8 y de la tridimensionalidad era eso un rollo un burdo acto de fe camuflado con la parafernalia de los computadores que en la epoca en que aparecio el articulo era mucho mas mistica que hoy en dia

2335481 an important part of human metabolism human diet is youre not so much what you eat as people say youre what you feed the bacteria in your gut so when we look at the chemicals in the blood after a meal theres roughly 2 500 compounds that we as a species can make we see roughly twice that many as bacterial metabolites in our guts from what we feed them so we live in a bacterial milieu we breathe it our guts every orifice our skin we have more bacterial cells than we have human cells and theyre a very key part of our existence we cant exist in a healthy life without them
2335482 were saying that we see evidence of every branch of life in almost every genome
2335483 because weve used it gets back to the gene centric view weve used those in the random design of biology as we will use them in the very specific design that we do in the laboratory and molecular biologists taxonomy is something where people sort of fool themselves by justifying what they see with their visual acuity
2335484 whereas the energy we get out of the ground oil and coal took millions of years of all those terawatts of sunlight hitting leaves in the carboniferous and being stored now with the biotechnology that you are doing it should be possible to capture those terawatts of energy on the fly as it were and use them in the present rather than stored over millions of years from the past and dug out of the ground
2335485 well just for the record we have not yet created a cell driven by a man made chromosome based on the chromosome transplant experiment though we know that that is definitely possible theres a lot of barriers to it theres different mechanisms in cells where because these are in fact key mechanisms of evolution if youre a cell swimming in the ocean and not only you take up a gene but you take up a whole chromosome from another species and it instantly transforms what you do as a species some species wanted to develop mechanisms to protect them against that theres a lot of barriers we have to overcome im hopeful that will happen this year
2335486 theres nothing you can do to solve your problems you have to cede more of the country to us and to our largest corporations to keep things going

2335490 at some point everyone goes through the heartache of data loss either through a hard drive crash an accidental deletion a theft a flood or a fire the obvious solution is automatic remote backup the problem is that backup is complex and expensive we wanted to make remote backup simple and free so we built mozy
2335491 mozy is designed to provide truly automated secure backup to users without requiring training investment or regimented routines mozy is simple secure and free plus it allows users to encrypt data with their own private key which means its dick cheney proof

2335499 raymond shaw is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
2335500 worse he seems to be trying to shrug off any responsibility for the chronic problems of overcrowding and staffing shortages that we feel are the root cause of the incident
2335501 his government has been well aware of these for a number of years but theyve done absolutely nothing to try and solve them
2335502 its these circumstances that create an intense pressure cooker in which we work
2335503 were bound to have these kinds of incidents especially in a remand centre like north fraser with its high turnover
2335504 we think that a proper review must look at all the factors including staffing shortages and overcrowding
2335505 it got me thinking about a more interesting and reflexive variation on this character the kook

2335514 its baffling to me theres no reason why we would not go to court
2335515 its rather silly to turn over physical evidence on an unsolved murder to a person who has no business conducting an investigation
2335516 if there is evidence you can bet law enforcement is fully pursuing those things and well get them accomplished
2335517 weve spent many hours over 3 1 2 years to get the dna evidence released
2335518 the dps crime lab is perfectly capable and well certified to handle things
2335519 he was not let go because of any incompetence or allegations made by anyone
2335520 the only way it will really affect us will be the time that we can go down to the state crime lab
2335521 we are used to hayne coming in at 5 p m and working the night hours but now it will be 8 a m to 5 p m
2335522 it wont change the amount of autopsies we are able to perform
2335523 in fact the turn around on our reports will probably be faster because of the new hours
2335524 ive been down in jackson all day hearing about how the state is handling this and ive been impressed with what ive heard
2335525 its actually going to be an ok deal for everyone
2335526 this is a huge first step this will fundamentally change the landscape in mississippi death investigation which for 20 years has been tainted by steven haynes misconduct and shoddy work
2335527 he has provided a tremendous service under very very difficult circumstances

2335615 la cuenca del naya requiere un lavado para limpiar toda la sangre derramada en sus tierras
2335616 el prop sito nuestro es que naciones unidas le dedique una sesi n a este caso examinen los expedientes conozcan la historia y pueda realizar un llamamiento y plantearle algunas recomendaciones al gobierno colombiano
2335617 el desarraigo de la poblaci n est en marcha con la implantaci n de econom as que hacen de la cuenca del naya un lugar imposible para la vida pero tambi n a trav s de campa as de exterminio sistem tico o masivo
2335618 no es una consecuencia del conflicto armado es un objetivo fundamental que pretende sacar a las comunidades para transformar el uso de estas tierras lo que acaba con los sistemas culturales que integran a la gente

2335965 they really seem to be flowing into the nondiscretionary areas like drugstores food and gasoline and its really coming at the expense of some of these retailers such as apparel and electronics and appliances
2335966 we think that when the stimulus checks end which is this quarter were going to hit an air pocket and disposable income will take a negative hit relative to what we saw in the second quarter
2335967 become the only real way to begin weaning ourselves from what will soon become clear peaking of global oil and gas
2335968 its official like a referees whistle im so bay wit it
2335969 how challenging a route can you follow and how far can you get on it
2335970 this past year i have designed and coached the first competitive climbing team in bellingham
2335971 its for ages 9 to 19 and essentially they come to the y twice a week to train on a team and theyre required to come once by themselves also
2335972 its designed to physically and mentally prepare them for competitions which are held every other saturday usually in seattle or portland
2335973 it has been going on for a while but its relatively new as far as sports go
2335974 ive been climbing for six years come this september and even in the past six years its exploded its become way more organized and more and more efficient
2335975 i really struggled in the semifinals so i ended up placing fifth but that was good enough to get me on the team and that was my goal
2335976 it was the most stressful competition in my life i was just relieved to be finished the happiness came later
2335977 the primary reason im going is because my coach has been extraordinarily patient with me wanting to pursue speed climbing
2335978 shes come up with time in her schedule to help me train for nationals and now for worlds and endless coaching and training strategies to help me succeed
2335979 for many of us the woods are a place we go to find peace and tranquility and a connection to nature that is not easily found elsewhere
2335980 hiking is usually a safe and wonderful experience but it does come with certain dangers just like any other activity hikers should always take precautions and be prepared to follow their instincts
2335981 plan to examine hunter education practices possible hunting age restrictions and other potential safety improvements for areas where mixed use recreation occurs during hunting seasons
2335982 when wagner went below natalie wasnt there he went back up on the deck and the dinghy was gone he knew she wouldnt have taken it because she was terrified of dark water and they would have heard its loud engine
2335983 having several decades to think about what happened wagner concluded that natalie heard the dinghy banging against the side of the boat and went to re tie it but she slipped on the always wet swim step and was knocked unconscious rolling into the water
2335984 after natalies death wagner went to bed for eight days in a catatonic state of profound emotional pain and blamed himself
2335985 your days are your life in miniature as you live your hours so you create your years as you life your days so you craft your life what you do today is actually creating your future the words you speak the thoughts you think the food you eat and the actions you take are defining your destiny shaping who you are becoming and what your life will stand for

2335988 i noticed this morning the grrrrrrreat imagine tony the tiger pictures of wolf point
2335989 just saw some of the updated pics of wolf point looks fantastic the fairway contours look unbelievable
2335990 this is what a golf course in texas should look like
2335991 we are always searching for something new and different something that has the feel of originality originality is the element that draws us and that is the element you have captured at wolf point

2335995 even though people have a choice not to wear helmets i wish they would consider the impact to their families and friends when they choose not to wear one
2335996 to blame not wearing a helmet for this accident is ridiculous
2335997 you figure to each their own its their choice for me i wear my helmet
2335998 it wasnt even registering on the speedometer i was just crawling i could walk as fast as i was moving
2335999 shes my only granddaughter and i adore her she adores me she wanted to sit up there i didnt see any harm in it
2336000 im a nurse ive been married for 30 years ive got three educated daughters
2336001 ive never been in trouble i dont drink i dont smoke i dont do drugs im a good person im a christian
2336002 yeah maybe my mother made a mistake and shouldnt have done that but yes they completely overreacted
2336003 it turned into my mom being a child abuser and thrown in jail overnight
2336004 my mom has suffered enough by having to be in jail overnight and have to have people think she would do something like that
2336005 whether i need to cry or hit a pillow or go outside and scream after that its over
2336006 i dont allow myself to dwell on pity thats not an acceptable emotion
2336007 i see the doc sometimes up to 15 times in a months time
2336008 id go back and it would be in a different place
2336009 she would mess with the nurses when they couldnt find her heartbeat
2336010 she would finally tell them its here behind my kidney
2336011 they filled my chest cavity with water and floated it into the correct position
2336012 she calls herself a freak of nature because most doctors shes seen have never seen this condition before
2336013 what you read in the textbook is sometimes different than what you see in the real world
2336014 in school they called me the human weathervane because every time i started wheezing it would rain
2336015 i coughed sneezed and farted all at the same time and broke six ribs a few months ago i guess its a talent
2336016 they say ill eventually sever my spinal cord but thats okay ill just run people over with my wheelchair and leave tire marks to prove i was there
2336017 i dont like green jell o i like the red
2336018 i want dr horwitz i want dr horwitz if i have to have my leg cut off i want him to do it
2336019 he held my hand and sang to me while i threw up on his shoe
2336020 i would wake up in the middle of the night and id clean her up and id get her washed up and redressed
2336021 whether i need to cry or hit a pillow or go outside and scream after that its over
2336022 i dont allow myself to dwell on pity thats not an acceptable emotion
2336023 shes someone that gives back to the community even when shes struggling herself
2336024 those are the people who are here on the ground who go into the meetings who are trying to understand all the implications of budget cuts and battles
2336025 some of us who care about these issues are petrified about the loss of coverage
2336026 the truth gets lost if it gets out at all said rich
2336027 citizens need this reporting and legislators cant be experts on every issue they depend on it too
2336028 with the staffing reductions going on i dont think its going to take too long for politicians and government entities to figure out that if you just keep feeding stuff to media outlets theyll only have time to deal with whats being churned out fineout said
2336029 there wont be any time to investigate or do anything more meaningful
2336030 a priority but i have to say that so is everything else in state government
2336031 i dont think weve ever had the resources it takes its not easy to cover a government representing 20 million people with three
2336032 the capital press corps has never done a particularly good job of covering the regulatory agencies the department of health the health care bureaucracy said david royse a former associated press reporter in tallahassee who now heads news service florida scheduled to launch next month
2336033 that explains why we have so many doctors eye specialists and hearing aid people because were here
2336034 i dont know if its just cheaper to retire into highlands or because some of those recent hurricanes made it more desirable to leave the water
2336035 mainly i like highlands county because there are not so many people its a small town atmosphere
2336036 thats what brought us up here very laid back people
2336037 learning to unearth our internal pictures of the world to bring them to the surface and hold them rigorously to scrutiny it also includes the ability to carry on learningful conversations that balance inquiry and advocacy where people expose their own thinking effectively and make that thinking open to the influence of others
2336038 i couldnt believe how she always wore her bikini and high heels in the house
2336039 yes but not my high heels and i didnt go out to the pubs with my knickers hanging out
2336040 well we all want publicity i saw you were in the papers
2336041 yes but who wants to be in the papers for being bad in bed
2336042 dont be afraid to speak your mind or interrupt we like to keep the conversation lively
2336043 the same consciousness that knows how to grow an egg and a sperm can i say sperm into a human being knows how to complete the process

2336110 we want to avoid any perception that the conduct of our criminal investigations and prosecutions is subject to political influence
2336111 its unusual to see a bribery prosecution where the payment wasnt to the defendant
2336112 it seems to me the conduct in this case was similar to a lot of what we take as normal for politics
2336113 i think the government reply brief demolishes siegelmans legal argument on the current case law
2336114 there is reason to believe that the case brought against governor siegelman may have had sufficient irregularities as to call into question the basic fairness that is the linchpin of our system of justice
2336115 the state of alabama was for sale when don siegelman was governor
2336116 my sense is there is a great unease with what has gone on here
2336117 its kind of if it could happen to him it could happen to anybody
2336118 my sole motivation for pushing the prosecution was a firmly held belief supported by overwhelming evidence and the law that former governor siegelman had broken the law and traded his public office for personal and political favors
2336119 there is no question but that the public integrity section was intimately involved
2336120 these guys doing the investigating were hell bent on finding something siegelman did wrong

2336217 wait is there something wrong with the advancement of women did i miss something here
2336218 yet even in defining the word we must take into consideration how feminism is widely practiced all too often feminism promotes women at the expense of other human beings men and children inasmuch as feminists have repeatedly failed to rectify this situation they no longer deserve any modicum of respect
2336219 hey i always said that believing that women are people to is exactly the same thing as sexually abusing children
2336220 i put feminism on the same level as child pornography are you taken aback at that statement ask yourself this is the murder of innocent children better than the sexual abuse of them feminism is most assuredly responsible for the death of millions of babies not only that it is also responsible for creating a debased culture where men and boys are routinely and systematically dehumanized
2336221 why should i take the concerns of men seriously theyre the oppressors oh by the way womens issues are everyones issues men can benefit from feminism why dont they take us more seriously
2336222 but domestic affair its like whats going on in the nation but its also me being drawn to all these domestic tasks knitting cooking caring for small children

2336227 we just dont have the support and infrastructure within our society to support the growing needs of the hispanic aging population
2336228 you have to understand the context in which a person lives their relationship to family the housing they need transportation
2336229 people want to solve their own problems even though there is treatment and health care available
2336230 we are trained to be responsible for our parents hasta al final to the very end
2336231 if i ever win the lottery i would construct a nursing home to fill the needs of elderly hispanics
2336232 health and human services are not a discussion that follows economic models
2336233 while we live in a nation that is enriched by a vast array of diverse traditions cultures and histories it is our commonality that most defines us
2336234 we know that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family
2336235 thats why ill double spending on quality after school programs so that you can know your kids are safe and secure
2336236 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom

2336261 wir haben wahrgenommen dass die erwartungen an die lehrkr fte in vielen f llen ihre realen gestaltungsm glichkeiten bersteigen

2336264 die verantwortlichen politiker nehmen mehrheitlich nicht zur kenntnis dass das deutsche bildungssystem der umfassenden verwirklichung des rechts auf bildung aus strukturellen gr nden entgegensteht sie versuchen den eindruck zu erwecken in deutschland werde das recht auf bildung durch ein begabungsgerechtes schulsystem umfassend gew hrt sie sind mehrheitlich zu einer ehrlichen analyse der gr nde und ursachen f r ungerechtigkeit benachteiligung und diskriminierung im und durch das bildungssystem nicht bereit sie versuchen vielmehr das traditionelle bildungswesen trotz sich mehrender gegenl ufiger empirischer befunde als reformierbar und in bereinstimmung mit dem recht auf bildung im sinne der un kinderrechtskonvention darzustellen folgerichtig werden m ngel die das system erzeugt dem p dagogischen personal angelastet entsprechend wird dann auch von den p dagoginnen und p dagogen die beseitigung der m ngel verlangt und erwartet

2336277 births are overmanaged over medicalised and midwives seem to have lost their empathy
2336278 our problem with this is that it could be dangerous and someone could die and we dont want mothers to put themselves and their babies in situations of unacceptable risk
2336279 we concluded in 1945 after our atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki that we had made war unthinkable and we have gone on thinking of it preparing for it fighting it suffering and profiting from it ever since

2336282 i can appreciate perfection without expecting it and i can really be just as attracted to a normal body as to a perfect one
2336283 so youre telling me that you can have an aesthetic appreciation for a handsome model or actor but your real attraction is to something more real

2336289 when people play action games theyre changing the brains pathway responsible for visual processing

2336294 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces said dr
2336295 we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
2336296 more and more people are becoming aware of this problem

2336299 the scales are a great service to our customers who are wishing to live a healthier lifestyle
2336300 we continue to put scales in our stores as part of tradition the scales have become synonymous with publix and our customers seem to expect them
2336301 years back for a short period of time we did not put scales in new stores and customers requested that we do so so now you will find a scale in all of our stores

2336322 i do not wish to give the impression that i think there is no mystery about consciousness but i do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper
2336323 would it think would it be conscious well im ultimately a materialist so i would say of course if you really could duplicate it piece by piece it would be all the same pieces theres no ethereal soul that makes me have consciousness it is in the physical properties of my brain and my nervous system so if you take that very broad notion of computer then it becomes a matter of whether youre a materialist or not
2336324 consciousness and free will are just illusions induced by the ambiguities of language we can build that in a machine just build a procedure that has a model of itself and that examines and responds to its own methods allow the process to reflect upon itself now you have consciousness
2336325 most people think consciousness is some kind of magical sauce that is added on top of the physical brain in this view consciousness is a mysterious entity separate from brains
2336326 many people persist in believing that consciousness is different and cant be explained in reductionist biological terms i believe that consciousness is simply what it feels like to have a neocortex
2336327 the cortex has no ability to model the brain itself because there are no senses in the brain thus we can see why our thoughts appear independent of our bodies why it feels like we have an independent mind or soul the cortex builds a model of your body and the world around you but it cant build a model of the brain itself your thoughts which are located in the brain are physically separate from the body and the rest of the world mind is independent of the body but not of the brain
2336328 theres a sense that once you start talking about consciousness next youll talk about religion
2336329 therefore it can be argued that the star trek characters are committing suicide each time they teleport with the new characters being created these new characters while essentially identical are made up of entirely different particles is consciousness a function of the actual particles or just of their pattern and organization
2336330 what evidence do we have that lizards and codfish do not possess some low level form of consciousness what right do we have to claim as some might that human beings are the only inhabitants of our planet blessed with an actual ability to be aware are we alone among the creatures of the earth as things whom it is possible to be i doubt it
2336331 many philosophers and psychologists seem to take the view that human consciousness is very much bound up with human language it is language according to this view that distinguishes us from other animals and so provides us with our excuse for depriving them of their freedom and slaughtering them when we feel that such need arises

2336338 after reviewing mrs mallets elec reports from 2003 and beyond it is clear that the idea that the 118 000 she owes from her 2003 primary is a
2336339 her campaign for the assembly last year also funded primarily by assembly speaker joe roberts george norcross and the camden county machine raised and spent over 1 million dollars if she was so committed to resolving the issue why didnt she pay it back then
2336340 the answer is simple because as elec commissioner peter tober put it there is often a
2336341 you bill this to campaign x well pay you from campaign y
2336342 the only debt amy mallet truly owes is to joe roberts george norcross and the camden county political machine for financing her campaigns considering the shape that camden and the state are in under the leadership of these same people that is something that should frighten every monmouth county resident
2336343 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2336344 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2336345 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
2336346 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
2336347 until a few years ago there was no privacy law in this country and each case tried to stretch it a bit further
2336348 the mosley case was the one that stretched it that bit further still with the judge quite clear in his reasoning its forced editors to be more careful certainly in a case of this nature where its a very high profile royal

2336379 people sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs rather than as persons to be loved and cherished how easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality without regard for modesty self respect or the moral values that bring quality to human relationships this is worship of a false god instead of bringing life it brings death
2336380 maybe immodestly dressed older women think that theyre beyond the age of posing a temptation and maybe they are
2336381 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians
2336382 solvaygirl is right there should be something provided by the district showing families what programs services assistance etc is available at each school and to whom it is available why do parents have to be detectives and go through every schools website or attend every open house just to find out bits and pieces of info

2336503 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
2336504 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law

2336740 dont build your business case top down attempting to capture the potential value across the entire enterprise
2336741 instead consider a bottom up approach that defines quantitative and qualitative roi for only those few select functional organizations that can best articulate and measure the business impact poor quality data has on processes
2336742 data used by business stakeholders to support their processes decisions or regulatory requirements with no reservations as to the datas relevance accuracy integrity and other previously agreed upon definitions of quality
2336743 scoping and prioritization based on the business processes within the organization that are most critically affected by poor data quality is the key to defining the business case that will get your trusted data initiative off the ground
2336744 eventually the tide will turn and these business stakeholders will sign up and support an enterprise class solution to solving their data quality problems but for that to happen value must be demonstrated
2336745 the smes subject matter experts who are feeling the most pain in untrustworthy data are scattered throughout your organization and luckily they are rarely shy

2336756 while hundreds of english couples danced to american jazz music last night in the ballroom of the hotel savoy in london thousands of radio enthusiasts in the united states from the eastern seaboard as far west as milwaukee listened to the same music brought to their home by the first successful experiment in double radio relaying
2336757 the people of the united states have received a new gift from radio the culture and music of london have come to them through the air
2336758 the first trans atlantic broadcast march 14 1925 representing a technological breakthrough this early orchestral broadcast originated in london traveled by land line to station 5xx in chelmsford crossed the atlantic where it was picked up by an rca transmitter in maine and relayed to stations wjz in new york and wrc in washington d c although the fidelity is low the recording is significant as a documentation of a technical achievement and a very rare instance of an extant example of a complete radio broadcast of the 1920s the entire 37 minute broadcast survives on discs in the collections of the university of marylands library of american broadcasting
2336759 recordings of actual radio broadcasts from the 1920s are extremely rare and recordings from before the formation of the nbc and cbs networks in 1926 and 1927 respectively are even more so technology was the main reason as electrical as opposed to acoustic recording was not perfected until 1925 because of this scarcity this recording transcribed on one side of a series of thick discs on march 14th 1925 would be of historical interest no matter what the content the fact that it is a recording of the first scheduled transatlantic broadcast via shortwave converted and sent to the listening public on the am band makes it truly important though the static laden music from london has little value as entertainment its significance as an invisible link between britain and the u s was tremendous

2336790 something not taken into account in previous races contributed to the performances
2336791 the issue is half a million swimmers feeling forced into purchasing 500 plus swimsuits in order to be competitive
2336792 if all athletes are wearing these new suits then whats the point
2336793 all we have done is artificially elevate performances across the board the new suits are only effective if only some athletes have access to them
2336794 if the suits make a 10 percent or even a 2 percent difference as predicted by the manufacturer its phenomenally fast when compared to annual improvements of much less than 1 percent
2336795 what this forces you to do is to start asking how fast would mark spitz have gone in 1972 how fast would jim montgomery have gone in 1976 if they would have had one of these suits it places all the previous records sort of out of context

2337373 i pretty much stick only to big investigative stories on subjects that i choose and leave the daily reporting and feature pieces to other journalists i have noticed that some american media houses are pulling back their freelance budgets just try getting an assignment past the foreign desk at npr these days but i bet that freelancers in america are feeling the pinch much more than i am while living on the rupee

2337524 prices should remain firm for the rest of the year as i expect some key buyers such as iran to buy in the last quarter of the year
2337525 prices may ease in the first quarter of 2009 if india resumes exports
2337526 the key factor will be whether india releases exports of its white rice
2337527 the pressure of the new arrivals of crops will begin in the month of september and october 2008 everywhere

2337530 strong portraits are supposed to evoke emotion and this one certainly does beautiful job controlling shadows and highlights bride and groom are along with each other and its beautiful congratulations on a fantastic surreal feeling image
2337531 this image was taken while covering an elopement with a fantastic couple kim and yuri in big sur we were headed to pfeiffer beach to take some portraits when we drove up on this scene with this truly amazing light and mist filtering through the trees needless to say i hit the brakes it was definitely one of those serendipitous moments when all the conditions align and youre just screaming inside while pressing the shutter
2337532 simple and clean composition the photographer captured great lighting highlights with the groom reaching over the photographer effectively captured a frame around the candles creating a strong visual element with no clutter in the negative space behind them your complete attention is drawn to the story
2337533 a quiet moment during the ceremony where their two flames become one i love how tenderly kiyomi reaches out to guide lans hand and how his arm helps frame the candles i was really drawn to try and capture the subtle candlelight on their faces keeping the image a little dark to pick up that rimlight
2337534 great action great expressions great light this is not an easy shot to get and everything came together for it
2337535 nice shot of the groom bride and a whole lot of other people dancing their worries away love the choice of black and white
2337536 with hands raised and doves flying this is a great action catch i like the interesting use of a wide angle lens the preacher in the middle adds an interesting storyline element she is framed perfectly within the bride and grooms arms i like the angle from the back of the bride and groom it is a different view of a dove release than i am used to seeing

2337561 this project is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance operating efficiencies improve cash flow and return on invested capital roic and reduce existing borrowings
2337562 so there are a lot of expectations in the first round coming in to make an immediate impact
2337563 i think you just have to have the mentality that youre going to make some mistakes and have real tough skin because the coaches are going to be yelling at you and trying to get you on the right path
2337564 youre not going to come in and completely dominate joe thomas did well but it wasnt lights out craziness so you have to come in with the mentality that every day youre going to get better
2337565 i got caught up in oh my god its michael strahan
2337566 in my head i was kind of in rookie awe and played really passive he beat me pretty bad in the first half but i came back saying i dont care who this guy is im going to play my game and i went out and shut him out in the second half
2337567 but i feel like i needed that game to raise my level of play
2337568 i learned so much from that game and from that point on i gave up one sack the rest of the year
2337569 during the game i was like man i cant stop him and the first time we played them i didnt give up any sacks at all so i was like what happened am i coming out of my stance slower or something like that
2337570 and later watching film it was just little things it was like i was lackadaisical not punching and things like that i didnt attack him
2337571 after the game maybe the plane ride back maybe i dwelled on it but that was it
2337572 you have to have the mentality that its not going to affect your confidence level
2337573 a lot of players start playing bad or having a bad practice and they start turning that into two bad practices and then a whole week of them then its a bad game and the confidence level goes down and has to be built back up
2337574 theres that transition of going from basically knowing 10 plays going into a game in college to knowing a 500 page playbook
2337575 the first thing is trusting the technique theyve been taught because its going to be different than college and uncomfortable for them
2337576 what happens is they wont have as much success early as later on and the tendency is to want to go back to the way they used to do it but once they trust the different technique progress comes a little faster
2337577 these guys are used to being the best player on the field and now theyre facing players who know how to take advantage of their mistakes and its a source of frustration
2337578 its up to us as coaches to get them through that
2337579 a lot of teams have these gigantic guys and just tell them to get to a spot if theres somebody in that area block him
2337580 but the broncos kind of ask you to be very athletic and run down the line to cut off a defensive tackle
2337581 the thing he really has going for him is hes got tom nalen at center who makes all the calls on the lines hes not going to have to make any calls with tom there
2337582 hell learn it eventually but in the beginning hell rely on tom and ben hamilton who have been doing it forever and know their stuff in their sleep theyll help him out
2337583 hes really been on top of his game i mean he probably gets the least coaching because i think he needs it the least he knows what hes doing and always has great effort thats a great kid its like he almost practiced before we came out here because hes always doing the right things and in meetings he knows all the answers
2337584 i tell you what whenever a defensive end asks you a logic question well start worrying about the wonderlic test
2337585 i think if you ever get in a comfort zone on the offensive line thats when you are going to get beat
2337586 i think for me it took a couple games in the regular season finding out boy i can block these guys before i felt confident to go out there and play
2337587 every little thing that you do players are so good and study so much they know what you are going to do before you do it based upon presnap alignment formation and how your stance is
2337588 if you study the game you are going to be able to help pick up on those things too
2337589 what i took from mayo was his work ethic at practice most guys dont play hard every snap he did im going to try and duplicate that this year
2337590 its not something thats even a temptation in my life right now i dont feel like it will be

2337595 the attacker can forcibly install google gadgets they can read the victims search history once a malicious gadget has been installed in some specific circumstances they can attack other google gadgets they can
2337596 really the sky is the limit once the browser is under the control of an attacker and that point is exacerbated by the fact that people trust google be a trustworthy domain making the attacks even easier

2337599 when writing the business plan they decided to stay away from the notion of a personal computer since the bankers they were talking to had no idea what a computer was or wasnt
2337600 so for the first product they needed something they could get off the ground with existing technology but the notion from the get go was to build a personal computer firm
2337601 when we were looking at how people access knowledge we found that there was a dearth of published information on three things innovation entrepreneurship which are positive things and the worrying part which is shortage of skill development
2337602 there is going to be a shortage of skills to drive indias growth story ganguly added
2337603 besides a weakness in our educational system there is a fundamental failure in our vocational education
2337604 if we overestimate the demand for our services and therefore overbuild our data center capacity our operating margins could be materially reduced which would materially impair our profitability
2337605 even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years
2337606 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2337607 a good example is energy conservation and improved energy efficiency if you leave that to the market it is simply not going to happen or is going to happen very very slowly
2337608 at one level we should be worried because it means we are going to be running into energy shortages on the other hand maybe its a good thing maybe thats what we need much higher prices to actually get people to start doing sensible things about energy

2337665 there were no indications of an error or negligence by the pilot the engine did not stop but witnesses said the rotor had stopped rotating as the helicopter dropped he said he said the strands of nylon string found on the rotor system reinforced the investigators theory that the accident was caused by a kite that was entangled with the helicopters rotor he said investigators learned that at least three kites were being flown close to the philippine air force base on mactan island at the time when the helicopter crashed as it was preparing to land
2337666 right now the quality of the tests is variable and the results are hard to interpret
2337667 a problem is that people expect to learn more than is currently provable
2337668 nothing that a sensible medical person couldnt tell you anyway
2337669 im not saying there isnt some scientific underpinning to the tests
2337670 but using a small number of research papers and extrapolating these for every individual patient is a problem
2337671 multiple genes can be associated with an increased risk of a disorder each exerting a small effect plus there are environmental factors like exposure to toxins alcohol consumption the foods we eat

2337807 this was against the islamic values as well as those of the establishment and the revolution and what the government claims to be accomplishing
2337808 putting a woman on the front is telling the world that we are not for the promotion of the islamic values
2337809 as i have also mentioned before the attendance of the iranian women in the international events and exhibiting them outside iran is against islamic values however not only we are sending them to the events they are put on the front as well
2337810 we can talk about chris till the dogs come home
2337811 i married chris i had a baby with chris chris will be in my life for the rest of my life but everything else ive learned that things are better left private until youre actually planning the wedding
2337812 no matter what is going on in my life relationship wise chris takes absolute precedence its important for ryder to hear me say how wonderful chris is and how much chris misses him
2337813 am i gonna look back and say god i wish i could have gone to that that concert

2337828 i definitely think that a lot of the music from the 50s and 60s has a lot to do with teenage heartache and love
2337829 being teenage girls its easy to relate to what theyre saying
2337830 teenagers grow up a lot faster but i still think people should go back to the lyrics and consider them in their own lives
2337831 its something that you cant find nowadays and its great to bring that to people
2337832 its teenage music written by teenagers and you cant get purer than that
2337833 carole king and jerry goffin were teenagers its not a box of corn flakes its not product it has heart you can hear it in the tracks
2337834 what weve really done is fine tune it and make it a show group
2337835 the whole shtick is they are 60s girls they are in that persona
2337836 it opened us up to this style of music that we love
2337837 the most difficult part has been having to fill some pretty big shoes in matching the sound of the 60s its a lot more difficult than it looks
2337838 weve been told thank you so much you brought me right back to my teenage years or my young adult days

2337858 they are the content specialist as well as the researcher as i see it i dont see them going away in fact the demand for the skills of the information professional complemented by technology skills is only going to increase in the organisation
2337859 i think the role of the information professional has the potential to evolve in so many ways
2337860 one of the trends is information professionals embedded in a business unit someone fully dedicated to marketing or competitive intelligence or research and development there is an embedding process where you can play the role in a specific department

2337891 will gillian choose her love of magic or the magic of love
2337892 but it is definitely an instrumental role a pivotal role i play pyewacket which is the familiar to gillian in order to do the most powerful magic she requires my influence she whispers things to me in order to win him sheperd she whispers to me and i sort of deliver the goods
2337893 well im strongly with the magical side love is fine for you humans the power of magic is the side that i came from its all very well for her so we witch familiars have to stick together so im off to the next
2337894 it is he who quietly and naturally but confidently and surely dominates each of the several short scenes where he appears pyewacket is the cat of cats the familiar of familiars the play really is about humans who think they deserve a chance too a chance they havent a ghost of with pyes compelling presence on the stage

2337930 the first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world
2337931 the second is freedom of every person to worship god in his own way everywhere in the world the third is freedom from want everywhere in the world the fourth is freedom from fear anywhere in the world
2337932 i dont think anyone could really argue with those four
2337933 i think thats what we want for children all over the world

2337935 we can help the company restructure their routes to optimize their staffs it makes the fleet more productive and reduces fuel and overtime costs
2337936 the service isnt just about fuel costs but the price of gas helps you open the conversation
2337937 the big objections in our company were that nobody could tell exactly what this 40 per vehicle monitoring was going to do for us
2337938 but once we did the pilot project on 400 service trucks it was great we saved about 300 a vehicle after a year after two years the project paid for itself
2337939 we didnt spy on employees we told them upfront that we were verifying the use of company assets and if they werent abusing the assets they had nothing to worry about
2337940 if you know the slope of a highway through your vehicles navigation system you can reprogram the engine to optimize fuel consumption

2337946 it would appear the council is either going to set itself up as a developer or has become a banking service for mr henderson
2337947 it is absolutely amazing that this council can find 17m to prop up a property developer but cannot find money to prop up rents for our most vulnerable tenants
2337948 it is an appalling decision the reality is it is a bailout for an individual and i do not believe in the council doing that
2337949 i do not regard it as a bailout i regard it as a move the city needed to take
2337950 it is a really bold move we have taken and it shows we are very committed to inner city revitalisation
2337951 it is not a great deal for dave henderson it is a great deal for the council

2337959 we are using power management technologies already but with their longrun technology we can leverage this technology to improve the power performance metrics of our products moving forward
2337960 a number of companies think they can just install sharepoint technology turn it on and everyone will start magically using it
2337961 in some organizations ive got to believe thats true but in many more organizations they kind of need to lead people to it the capabilities in sharepoint are great but not everyone gets it right away
2337962 the fact that we are around and there is a place that people can go will give them some confidence
2337963 unfortunately there are some companies that take a dim view of some peoples freedom to tinker
2337964 in my experience the smaller the company the worse they are
2337965 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store
2337966 in my experience communication has been pretty spotty so far as opposed to the great service apples provided with developer technical support we have questions that have gone unanswered so far and unlike dts we dont even have any kind of direct contact with anyone there unfortunately
2337967 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements
2337968 automated e mail systems being employed on both ends which resulted in e mails being lost in transit
2337969 its like the app store division is this top secret untouchable branch of apple
2337970 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
2337971 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end
2337972 clear consistent communication and a application standard policy that is clear and applied universally to all developers
2337973 communication is the key here both between apple and devs and also among devs themselves
2337974 the iphone sdk nda has been completely hindering progress and it needs to be lifted asap
2337975 if apple wants to keep things in upcoming versions of the sdk under wraps then it should be possible to modify the nda so that were all able to communicate about things that are in the final shipping version of the iphone os and sdk once this happens iphone development in general will improve because well be able to discuss issues openly and share code publicly the iphone platform as a whole will undoubtedly improve as a result
2337976 wlan service will not be provided during the opening and closing ceremony of the olympic games and paralympic games thus internet will not be accessible during the aforementioned ceremonies
2337977 our recent channel checks show that the industry pendulum has swung into a buyers market where customers are holding back orders
2337978 over shipment of large area lcd panels in the second quarter due to an overly optimistic outlook for 2008 was the main factor contributing to the rapid and significant panel price reductions seen in the panel supply chain beginning in june

2337991 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
2337992 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
2337993 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed

2338025 for some time as an industry weve just gone about our business and consistently in the background weve delivered economic benefit to new zealand
2338026 weve continued to do that without too much fuss often in the face of quite major international disturbances like the respiratory disease sars september 11 and the asian crisis
2338027 the times come when more and more people in our industry realise that perhaps as a combined force in new zealand society we havent pitched the case as well as we could have
2338028 that was a good comment from john but i want to see tourism being managed by the
2338029 in fact tourism australia has put where the bloody hell are you on hold and are putting all the resource into leveraging that movie
2338030 it seems to me there is a very real danger that new zealand will become tasmanias cheap sister offering events at one third of the price of australians
2338031 rod oram certainly raised a few eyebrows with his comments on australia at tia we believe that australia is a very important market for new zealand and despite rods comments we endorse tourism new zealands decision to invest an extra 2 million in the australian market this year
2338032 but i dont think trying to go into the australian market is shortsighted necessary if thats where the future is going to be thats a good decision to go there
2338033 would clearly need a large injection of government funding people have felt for too long we havent been internationally competitive up against some other destinations the likes of melbourne and brisbane
2338034 to go into tourism is to take a risk with your money or someone elses money if you take the risk and make the commitment then we believe you should be able to take the reward profit is the engine of growth in this industry

2338040 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

2338091 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2338092 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2338093 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2338094 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2338095 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2338096 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2338097 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2338098 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2338099 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
2338100 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
2338101 that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2338102 its been an enormous year for telecom and were really pleased to have come in in line with full guidance
2338103 what happens with a stock like this is when future dividends are seen as more likely to be lower than higher the share price will adjust down and thats whats happening
2338104 in an ideal world when companies are reinvesting significant sums they are growing their earnings to at least maintain their return on capital but what were seeing with telecom is earnings decreasing and capex increasing which is about the worst combination
2338105 a lot of us feel that this is actually more of a structural change than a cyclical one
2338106 you think im going to wear this why would you buy this for me

2338108 a worker who has to do all the unpleasant or boring jobs that no one else wants to do

2338118 william kicketts a good boxer but he doesnt have anything that really worries me
2338119 id love to fight him hes unbeaten and im unbeaten so the fight is a natural
2338120 but i hold a world title and he doesnt once he wins a major belt then the fight becomes a lot more attractive
2338121 if we give the fight time to brew we can both do a lot better out of it financially than if we fight now
2338122 it amp squo s got the potential to be a superfight in australia
2338123 william kickett amp squo s a good boxer but he doesn amp squo t have anything that really worries me
2338124 i amp squo d love to fight him he amp squo s unbeaten and i amp squo m unbeaten so the fight is a natural
2338125 hes played some fullback before the idea is to give him a bit more room to move and not wear him out defensively
2338126 one of his strengths is his support play so hopefully we can take advantage of that brent crisp has played well for us there but hes just hit a rough patch
2338127 i think if you look at ewan mcgrady when he first came down they played him in the halves and he was maybe a little too quiet for that once they moved him to fullback that was his making and he won a rothmans medal
2338128 we want him to get a full week of training in before he comes back
2338129 i know lots of teams think they can come out and start throwing punches and put us off our game
2338130 but i think this team can basically adapt to any style of play
2338131 over the last couple of weeks someone always comes up and says it is going to be a punch up or a head butting contest but at the end of the day if they want to turn the light off and go down back alleys then we can handle that
2338132 he is the sort of bloke you dont want to take on he doesnt say much and i think he picked the wrong guy
2338133 i think during certain parts of the game we were our own worst enemies we were a little off tonight
2338134 probably the start wasnt the best we were pretty poor there were some areas there i know we can really manage better and work on
2338135 i thought it was an intense sort of game and a good game to watch they completed their sets at the start and we just cant come up with those unforced errors against this melbourne side
2338136 we showed intensity but we just gave them too much ball
2338137 at the end of the day it was a great spectacle and no one held anything back
2338138 it is just a great rivalry and a game which brings out the best in everyone

2338147 based on fearmongering and lies israeli factions have compelled the us and the uk to move sanctions against the iranians without any tangible evidence whatsoever of military aims
2338148 to respond to your question thats not the issue the issue is whether iran has a legal right to enrich uranium and be assisted internationally to do so under the npt they do
2338149 to simply defame and slander iran and to manipulate the powers that be to move against iran and suppress it from becoming a dominant regional power
2338150 memoirs of a nice irish american girls life in occupied territory
2338151 thank you everyone i dont want to make it seem like im keeping score
2338152 right now iran is doing everything under a legal right
2338153 they can only force iran to do their bidding via war games and what they think is diplomacy
2338154 we also agree that israel wants to limit the influence of iran or the influence that it would or would not have with nuclear power however it remains true that an even more volatile country pakistan has had nuclear bombs for years
2338155 currently iran is a very dominant regional power anyhow its sheer size alone intimidates many of its neighbors but does iran actually pursue intimidation as a means of forcing its will upon other in the region no thats a game the west and israel has been playing for years lets just get that one straight
2338156 a very big insult to jews all around the world
2338157 it doesnt include this offices costs such as expert fees and travel expenses
2338158 when someone like phill kline does something like this just to grandstand the taxpayers have to fund that
2338159 and theyre funding grandstanding on something that was clearly unconstitutional

2338162 there is genuine interest there is a little bit of mystique about the super 14 for a lot of players
2338163 i am absolutely sure there will be players jumping at the opportunity to give it a go
2338164 if you throw a carrot in front of someone like chabal he could turn up and do something amazing people would flock to see him play because you dont know what will come of it
2338165 the french have some really athletic second rowers or you look at someone like paul oconnell the hard physical irish second rower if youre losing dan vickerman you chase someone like him
2338166 in the sixes there are some very athletic aggressive guys running around over there you look at guys like the england flankers joe worsley and lewis moody ryan jones out of wales or even a serge betsen theres no shortage of talent to look at
2338167 obviously this ruling by the aru opens the playing field up globally
2338168 we feel we have some good young players a year off playing super 14 and two years off being a starting player
2338169 some people will wait and see and others will jump in to have jonny wilkinson playing for the reds or brian odriscoll playing for the brumbies would generate a lot interest
2338170 but the reality is anyone who is half decent is already contracted until june next year so i think it is more leading into the 2010 season well open up more
2338171 when you look at any player youll look not only at what they can do on the park but what they can add to the culture of the team
2338172 i will look to my left and to my right and there will be drug cheats
2338173 i will look to my left and to my right and there will be drug cheats
2338174 ive had a lot of contact with him and he is very interested to be part of the qualifiers
2338175 it would be useless to select a league players as it the competition starts next week and also clubs have players at the olympics
2338176 by the end of august hell probably be fit to start playing games but thats not enough time before we go to uzbekistan
2338177 its the same situation with tim recovering from a broken foot
2338178 both cahill and viduka are doing well and are on schedule but not for the september game
2338179 its a tough group japan uzbekistan qatar bahrain australia and it will be a tough year
2338180 naturally youd like to win your games away from home too but its good to know that we are playing three of our last four games at home
2338181 they are totally different to what we have been playing against asian teams i dont know that much about them
2338182 i saw argentina and ivory coast last night too and i thought it was a high quality game
2338183 it will be interesting to see how they olyroos go against a great team like argentina it will be tough and they will have to give 100 per cent
2338184 the one thing i know at the moment is ive still got that fire in the belly the burning desire to play football
2338185 in a way it was probably a good thing it happened being dumped i guess everybody needs to be reminded that if youre not playing well you wont be playing first grade
2338186 i worked on a few things jt wanted me to i wont say what but dropping back did make me more determined
2338187 i was happy with last week but i know i have to back it up again against the sharks
2338188 but while its looking good for 2009 the main thing is we finish our last five games as well as we can
2338189 we come up against some of the top sides but if we just focus on our own game anything can happen
2338190 this would be my final chance to play in a world cup because of my age and id love the chance to play for the kiwis again
2338191 it comes back to that fire in the belly and with a few players injured theres always the chance
2338192 i got to be tito ortiz to lose this fucking key look at the size
2338193 im going to do my best and i think i can win
2338194 you shouldnt use coal but were not going to help you either
2338195 because sediment is always flowing down the river changes to the riverbed profile can occur quickly despite environment waikatos efforts to manage the river to maintain flows safely within the river banks
2338196 the challenge is to ensure this is carried out on a scale that is economic for all parties whilst meeting the environmental needs of the river community
2338197 it is vital that any unduly onerous requirements of the rma do not get in the way of gaining timely consents
2338198 an added unknown is how difficult it will be to ensure timely and economical consent if and when control of the river and its bed is handed to tainui
2338199 one of the main issues is getting a better understanding of what is happening on the river

2338236 its so frustrating because i just missed half of my senior season in college then i come back and im doing well in camp about to play in my first game since october and i injure my elbow and get sidetracked for three months
2338237 its frustrating but at the same time ive got to stay focused stay smart in my mind and dont get mentally broke down i just have to stay positive about the whole situation and make it work
2338238 but its also exciting to play in your first nfl game at a position that you havent done since high school im really excited i know its going to be a good experience and im going to play the fourth quarter as far as i understand it at linebacker too
2338239 to me its all about the more i can do the more i can help out the better chances i think i have of making the team

2338244 even if the wto has become extremely unwieldy it would be crazy to walk away from doha unless there is something better
2338245 through that work i realized parents were struggling in isolation without access to information to help their children
2338246 we societal need to make some fundamental changes in allowing all members of society to be safe in who they are
2338247 i really want everybody to be accepted for who they are and not have to hide or be afraid of being a target or being a target just because of who they are
2338248 we are a nation devoted to individuality and personal expression on many levels and this is another level that needs to be accepted for children this is just part of the normal expression of humanity

2338263 the uk should take active steps to prepare for dangerous climate change of perhaps 4c according to one of the governments chief scientific advisers
2338264 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2338265 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2338266 it seems to me that the administrative burden on the courts per se is not a relevant consideration in deciding whether to sist a cause it is the responsibility of the court with the assistance of the scottish court service to provide proper facilities for litigation to proceed for rights to be vindicated and remedies provided it should be no concern of the pursuers in the instant actions that an additional administrative burden may be placed on precious resources simply because others wish to seek the same remedy as they do
2338267 it seems to me that i ought to have regard only to the burden on the defenders in each of the instant cases and not in any other similar cases which may arise in this court or in other courts in scotland looking at the matter in this way i consider that such a burden is insufficient to offset the respective pursuers right to have their claims adjudicated upon with proper dispatch even if i am wrong in that and do have to consider the administrative burden on the defenders in similar actions i still do not consider that they have discharged the onus upon them bearing in mind that to date there are only 350 actions or so proceeding in scotland involving all of the banks who are the defendants in the oft action i was not told how many of these actions are against each of the defenders but it must be only a fraction of that total

2338272 kontera has proven to be a fantastic addition to the adsense ads on my blog it has increased my overall revenue without having any adverse effect on my adsense statistics best of all i have received very positive feedback from my blogs visitors
2338273 adsense has always been the main source of revenue for my website and i was reluctant to place any other advertising as i feared a drop in my adsense revenue i decided to give kontera ads a try because they did not take up any additional space on my web pages within a few weeks the kontera revenues started to grow and best of all there was no drop off in my adsense my kontera results have exceeded my expectations and now provide a significant complementary income stream

2338296 at the time we needed it most our city was there for us
2338297 right now there is a higher demand than supply for solar panels which means that if we bought them now we would be paying a premium price
2338298 so i think we should definitely go ahead with the infrastructure so that they can eventually be installed but just wait a little while on the purchase of the panels
2338299 im not running for anything but my highest and best use is trying to be a good governor and trying to help sen obama in virginia which as you know traditionally hasnt gotten a lot of attention in presidential years
2338300 i really believe for the first time in 44 years that we have a great chance of getting the electoral votes in a blue column for sen obama this fall
2338301 virginia is going to be one of the two or three key states for obama

2338305 this thoughtful neuroscientist s book about brain evolution structure and function which places refreshing emphasis on some relatively messy and ad hoc qualities of brain evolution and on the inefficiencies of brain design and function seems to me significantly flawed by its frequently brash and breezy style
2338306 as anarchists we feel the greatest problem with government is how its primary interest is to protect the profits of those in power even when it comes at the expense of the general public
2338307 spending 50 million dollars on weaponry to attack people voicing their opinion and flooding the streets with riot police while schools close down children go without health care and people lose their homes is exactly the problem with the corrupt two party system were opposing this august
2338308 thats what were working towards a world where peoples basic needs are met and those most affected by the issues at hand are the ones that have the most say
2338309 when you look at the dnc you see that the opposite is true instead of our needs being met our city is being militarized and instead of the people who have the most at stake making decisions in the convention its the corporations and party insiders living it up behind a wall of heavily armed police
2338310 if the city agrees to fund peoples needs instead of corporate greed and suppressing dissent ill be spending my free time catching up on some books and being with my family

2338322 en los ltimos a os nos hemos centrado mucho en aumentar el n mero de pacientes en tratamiento pero parece que hemos descuidado un poco las tareas de prevenci n clave para frenar la epidemia de sida
2338323 por primera vez en nuestra historia hemos dedicado un monogr fico a la prevenci n y esperamos que sea el ltimo porque eso significar que las medidas empiezan a dar resultado
2338324 la falta de programas de salud p blica es en gran parte responsable de que casi 2 5 millones de personas se infecten con el virus cada a o es escandaloso que las campa as para fomentar el acceso a los medicamentos no hayan ido acompa adas del mismo esfuerzo en estrategias de prevenci n
2338325 las instituciones deben ser m s honestas y admitir los fallos los esfuerzos preventivos han sido simplemente escasos
2338326 el grado de esfuerzos realizados hasta ahora no es el suficiente
2338327 debemos tener el coraje de seguir adelante porque si fallamos en el desaf o de la prevenci n del vih el sida minar implacablemente el progreso humano
2338328 la d cada de los 90 fue la de las oportunidades perdidas el virus sigui avanzando ante la pasividad de la sociedad
2338329 si se intensifica una buena prevenci n combinada podr an evitarse 12 millones de nuevas infecciones desde ahora hasta 2015 afirma el director de onusida
2338330 la tr gica realidad es que no se ha proporcionado un enfoque claro para asegurarse que todos los j venes tienen la informaci n que necesitan antes de practicar el sexo
2338331 si queremos que las estrategias funcionen debemos empezar por analizar a fondo cu les han sido eficaces hasta la fecha y cu les no y adem s es necesario que se unan dentro de un paquete de medidas y que no vaya cada una por libre porque no se conseguir nada
2338332 tener claro a qui n dirigimos la prevenci n es fundamental que conozcamos las caracter sticas de las epidemias locales

2338346 today ive lost not just a colleague but a good friend ive loved and respected
2338347 my heart goes out to the wise family for their loss of j b and i know the community will miss him a lot
2338348 its devastating i just think im numb i dont know what to say i cant believe its happened again
2338349 my prayers are with the family and teri he was such a neat person very knowledgeable very sincere always had a smile always had a laugh had that twinkle in his eye and hell be greatly missed
2338350 extremely intelligent extremely hard working extremely interested in what was best for bullhead city
2338351 and in the short period of time that he was on the council he had a tremendous impact on the council as a whole on the city its just a tremendous loss
2338352 we had the same sense of humor im aggrieved beyond belief i introduced him to bullhead city politics and i convinced him to run i met him when i was campaigning and we were instant friends
2338353 he is the most stand up person ive met in a long time a man of his word he has impeccable integrity i cant even imagine going on without him he was such a great guy to work with and to be involved with on the council i cant believe weve lost him
2338354 he is energetic hes smart he was one of the best things to happen to the city council in a long time hes honest hes open hes ethical theres nothing negative at all about j b
2338355 j b really helped me so much during my transition hes really going to be missed he had so much energy he was so good for our community he brought so much experience its going to be real tough without him
2338356 he was a tremendous asset to our council and he filled a void where a void needed to be filled and i relied on him and his expertise and his counsel im just going to miss him terribly absolutely terribly

2338358 involucran en un secuestro a un hombre clave de juan pablo ii
2338359 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2338360 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2338361 we are trying work all this through with the democratic national committee and with the obama campaign
2338362 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2338363 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2338364 its important that her supporters have a voice in some way
2338365 she is a duly registered candidate who got a lot of votes and she is going to do what she wants to do

2338370 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined the nature of the audience has only scarcely been investigated so far but it is clearly vital social identity theory holds that when people act as group members their world view changes
2338371 we will investigate what happens when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status
2338372 in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune schadenfreude rather than empathy
2338373 if you trip over in the street you feel very embarrassed of course people in your own group who witness this your friends or those close to you feel empathic embarrassment and try to alleviate the situation and make you feel better

2338446 despite the disappointment tom brady and the patriots are about to go right back at it and eli manning and the giants will have to prove it all over again

2338488 when i was young back in sudan i was the happiest kid
2338489 then one sunday morning my parents and i went to 8 oclock mass we were celebrating in an open air church when the soldiers came in and pulled all the kids away they dragged us to a big truck that was covered in canvas and i was just crying and crying because i missed my parents
2338490 there were about a hundred of us and when we took the cloth from our eyes we realized that it was only boys
2338491 and death was right there i witnessed a lot of kids who were just sitting there then they would go to sleep and they wouldnt stand up again
2338492 i was so little my friends were dragging me along we were running running running two days three days three nights thats when my racing began
2338493 they said we could write our life story and send it to the embassy and they might pick us
2338494 i had to learn everything like a kid again and my parents took a lot of time to teach me
2338495 even stuff like how to take a shower with the cold water and the hot water and how you have to put it in the middle
2338496 after they picked me up from the airport they took me to mcdonalds and ordered chicken for me i ate one chicken sandwich and there was another one they said go ahead you can throw it away we got more food at home
2338497 so i saw this thing like i have chicken to throw away no im taking it home and then i ate it the next day i couldnt believe what you could get here
2338498 i could maybe eat something with that money but the guys said to save it until something called the olympics comes
2338499 then one night they say tonight we gonna go and watch the sydney olympics
2338500 he had that usa jersey on and i tell you he was fast
2338501 i couldnt believe it seeing somebody run and a lot of people are watching and theyre cheering runnings what we do all our lives its part of our transportation
2338502 to see michael run and get up and receive the medal and the national anthem went on and off and he started crying i was like wow this is it
2338503 they took some things that i had some beads id worn when i was young things like that and buried them
2338504 so now we went out there and we dug these things up
2338505 we got killed in the run game in the preseason opener last year

2338509 but it seems like a long time ago that it was

2338511 if i played first base and was a big guy id be in the lineup tonight playing first base but im a center fielder and i have to run
2338512 well see how it reacts tomorrow im hoping a couple of days what i dont want is a setback
2338513 when he comes back we want him in there every day
2338514 we know by his record what he means to us
2338515 im a positive person and i believe i can help when you see your teammates out there you want to be out there with them
2338516 i only had 61 pitches after five innings so they told me to pitch to one more batter i got him out in two pitches then the next hitter in three and the last one in six
2338517 when i played shortstop and batted leadoff wednesday it was the first time my brother and i both batted leadoff and played shortstop on the same day
2338518 oh yeah i got him by far he was 1 for 4 and as usual no errors that boy can play
2338519 have you ever seen a reds team so lifeless so dead so disinterested
2338520 a 5 0 lead doesnt hurt psychologically he knows he can beat us psychologically his team knows it and probably psychologically our team knows it plus a lot of great pitching and a lot of luck
2338521 oswalt is a tough tough pitcher and he made some tremendous pitches to encarnacion right there
2338522 we had the same amount of hits 13 but that three run homer was the difference
2338523 hit the ball hard right there but right at him
2338524 we hit a lot of balls hard off oswalt too but right at people
2338525 a tough night once in the field and a tough night once on the bases call it youthful exuberance and he was as upset as anybody he knew he made a mistake and you wont see him make it any time in the future because he is a smart ballplayer sometimes you have to learn the hard way
2338526 i threw a lot of pitches in the first inning but when we scored a lot of runs it seemed they began swinging early in the count

2338540 act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
2338541 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2338542 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2338543 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2338544 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2338545 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2338546 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2338547 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2338548 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it moreso than a lot of people can
2338549 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2338550 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2338551 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2338552 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2338553 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2338554 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2338555 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more
2338556 go on number three wake up five go on my son
2338557 this is a real community here and theyre destroying it look around you youve got all sorts four and five year old kids jumping up and down they wont do that in front of a computer screen
2338558 nearly a century of history so much of the old east end has already gone this place shutting down is a tragedy
2338559 not the sort of customer who was ever going to ensure its survival but when you hear its going its a side of london i love
2338560 because she isnt going to get the chance to see them here again
2338561 with my grandparents my parents i really will miss it theres such a buzz here a real electricity
2338562 itll tear the heart right out of this community rip it right out its a disgrace
2338563 people never retire from the stow ive got a colleague in her mid 80s i just think what am i going to do with my saturday night i love this place
2338564 at that time a working man couldnt get a legal bet except at a dog track he couldnt get credit at a bookmakers greyhound tracks were also a lot cheaper to get into than racetracks and far easier to get to
2338565 the problems started with the arrival of the betting shop in the mid 1960s
2338566 the popularity of the sport as a bet remains remarkably strong greyhound racing accounts for about a fifth of all betting shop turnover the problem is that fewer people are actually going to the tracks to bet now you can walk down to the high street bookies or place your bets on the internet or even through your television set
2338567 at home i feel 89 when im taking bets i feel 70
2338568 your choice for a night out was the dogs the cinema or the dance hall what cant young people do these days though mostly they sit in front of the telly and push buttons
2338569 is that these days theres no longer any money in cloth caps on the terraces you have to offer a leisure experience fine dining and excellent wines rather like the labour party you have to attract a more prosperous constituency football has done it
2338570 theyre faring modestly well tracks like yarmouth where you could now eat your dinner off the floor and peterborough poole sheffield belle vue there are new tracks being considered too
2338571 you can have a modest flutter a couple of quid the action is fast and furious you dont have to move from your seat in the restaurant if you take it seriously the betting side is a science of amazing proportions and the animals are of course absolutely wonderful
2338572 is now well on its way to being resolved 80 plus of retired racing dogs are now rehomed thats north of 8 000 animals a year and the others are put down by a licensed vet you really cant run a modern leisure business if theres any hint of cruelty attached to it i can now look at myself in the mirror without feeling ashamed which i couldnt five years ago
2338573 just wanted out and didnt particularly want there to be any greyhound racing in walthamstow after they have gone
2338574 has never made a loss and just look around you theres clearly a massive desire for this venue for people round here the stow is walthamstow attendances have been up for the last 18 months it needs to be brought up to date a bit and it needs to be managed better there are 800 jobs here it could do with half that
2338575 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2338576 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2338577 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2338578 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2338579 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2338580 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2338581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2338582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2338583 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2338584 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2338585 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2338586 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2338587 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2338588 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2338589 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2338590 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him
2338591 it is quite simply the best guide available today to the culinary renaissance of the city and region in the post communist era
2338592 twain melded his attacks on slavery and prejudice into tales that were on the surface about something else entirely he drew his readers into the argument by drawing them into the story

2338594 why because ip is all about the very first time the aha moment the creative spark that gives rise to previously undreamed imaginings

2338599 if i had known how wonderful marriage would be i wouldnt have been so scared
2338600 yet the state department and fairfax county supervisors duck hide and punt the issue back and forth failing to act in the best interests of county citizens and the u s this is my seventh post on this issue since may and i am no more optimistic that they will act than i was in may

2338605 there are a lot of people who are not happy because they are not sure who is managing who
2338606 in any commercial business arrangements or any business contract there will be commercially sensitive information to ignore this standard business practice would damage the councils reputation and any potential further opportunities for work with the private sector
2338607 a limited amount of commercially sensitive information is not being disclosed in accordance with normal commercial practice
2338608 it might be too late for the three public bodies who have pledged their millions
2338609 but for the remainder we are calling for a full inspection by the commission we are also demanding improved transparency and accountability and a clear timetable for future plans so we can consult our members
2338610 the audit commission have already conducted a review of the southwest one process in their capacity as the councils auditors since 1 april 2007

2338612 i have read that if a child comes to christ 12 of the time the whole family will follow
2338613 if the mom comes theres a 15 chance the family will but if the man comes to church 90 of the time the family will come along behind
2338614 contextualization extracts the gospel message like a concept reduces it to a narrow point of contact and seeks to attract people via this appeal to this contact contextualization by its very nature is attractional
2338615 contextualization makes it almost impossible for the church to be transformational
2338616 stresses the gospel as a translatable trans cultural as opposed to intra cultural concept
2338617 makes the church susceptible to the territorialization of the market where everything becomes splintered into market niches inevitably separating us from one another
2338618 seeks to incarnate the gospel over long periods of time culturally within a context by entering into a culture as a communal presence
2338619 evangelicals uncritical of their modernist bias are addicted to contextualization
2338620 conversations among human beings sound human they are conducted in a human voice
2338621 gee if i joined 121 i guess thatd count as my fourth mens movement since the early 1970s
2338622 well if were going to respond to misandry in the churches then perhaps well finally deal with all the misogyny and if thats the case maybe we can take the truly important step and go against the misanthropy
2338623 i wonder if we were able to resolve all the underlying problems that made us all disgusted with how church was done where we went before wed automatically have a church that appealed more broadly and would that make it a multicultural church
2338624 masculinity and femininity have more to do with whats stored in the attic than how the plumbing works
2338625 one of our biggest priorities is to encourage young people to get into reading and to enjoy their local libraries the image that some young people have of libraries is not a very positive one and we are hoping to challenge this
2338626 by using text messaging which all youngsters are very comfortable with and the internet we are hoping to reach new readers and encourage them to come into the library where we hope they will be pleasantly surprised
2338627 the books have been selected to tie in with recent cinema and dvd releases and include angus thongs and full frontal snogging the books title changed slightly for film which is currently in cinemas
2338628 more than anything else im sorry for myself for living without you
2338629 as currently drafted there is a real risk that the eu pnr proposal would degrade e borders by prohibiting the use of pnr data for combating immigration offences
2338630 we will therefore lobby strongly for the eu framework decision not to preclude the use of pnr for this purpose
2338631 we are working hard with eu partners to reach agreement on a text which is acceptable to all

2338848 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public

2338899 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2338900 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb

2338927 de moeite om eens tot over t water te komen dus
2338928 when i was going bad it was just a matter of having a consistent approach and really swinging at strikes
2338929 you dont have to do anything youre not capable of you just have to stay consistent you look at the great hitters in the game and theyre all consistent go pull up the video right now and theyre not swinging at stuff all over the place theyre staying within the strike zone and staying within their means
2338930 i take pride in my defense and obviously i take pride in hitting but i take more pride in a win
2338931 weve had many discussions about being in command of the strike zone
2338932 hes a very good pupil he listens and responds and remembers and recalls thats what you want young players to do be coachable and retain what youre telling them and take it to the field thats what hes doing
2338933 i tell our young pitchers all the time to run
2338934 i remember watching ferguson jenkins in chicago and hed run from line to line every game whyd he throw 300 innings he ran
2338935 when i was with the dodgers don sutton tommy john rick sutcliffe theyd all take off before bp batting practice up a hill and they didnt come back until after bp guys get hurt doing that artificial stuff the stationary bike and stair climbers im not saying theyre bad but theres no substitute for running
2338936 thats not that many innings and his velocity is still good
2338937 whats happened is hes set the bar so high for himself no 1 and no 2 the league makes adjustments to you after watching film these guys arent going to let you keep getting them out its up to you to make adjustments
2338938 it isnt called the dog days of august because its april sometimes youve got to go into uncharted waters to learn as long as you arent hurt you have to pull through it sometimes you have to give the dudes on the other side some credit you have to make an adjustment hell make it
2338939 why not its his first year in this league not many guys have broken into the league the way he has what am i going to do jump off now because hes had a couple bad starts hes still at the top of the league in a lot of stuff hes fallen off strikeout wise but hes still learning
2338940 i have it in my contract that i get some fragrant flowers in my room on the road
2338941 theyre supposed to be nonsmoking rooms but someone is always smoking those cigars
2338942 his endurance isnt up to starting its a little late in the year to get there
2338943 but hes strong as a bull i like what i see in masset he wants the ball he isnt scared he looks like a tough guy to me you need tough guys
2338944 discusi n del proyecto de ley que introduce modificaciones a la ley n 17 336
2338945 newman concluded that each month that the war continued in 1945 would have produced the deaths of upwards of 250 000 people mostly asian but some westerners
2338946 the submarine blockade and the united states army air forcess mining operation operation starvation had effectively cut off japans imports
2338947 immediately after the defeat some estimated that 10 million people were likely to starve to death
2338948 if a case can be made for hiroshima its very difficult to see what nagasaki was apart from experimentation on live animals
2338949 fit seat belts to their sofas because its going to be a spectacular ride
2338950 the luck of participating in an olympics held in our motherland is a once in a century opportunity and a dream that our predecessors have fought to fulfil for 100 years
2338951 this is a historical chance for us we are burdened with a glorious mission
2338952 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2338953 i think the actual olympics themselves the venues the guests the athletes are going to be safe
2338954 theres obviously significant numbers of uighurs with some sort of cause who have a grudge against chinese authority and are prepared to use violence to seek whatever objectives theyre seeking
2338955 the people of all ethnic groups in kashi will remember you forever
2338956 we need someone with good language skills and most uighurs cant speak chinese well we also have high standards for cleaning the rooms and uighurs just cant meet those standards
2338957 we were lucky to have leaders with a sense of mission
2338958 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when they are still alive its heartbreaking for me
2338959 im not trying to be in everybodys face and be harsh or negative i want to be calm and yet get my voice out there im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
2338960 each athlete has been allowed to do one pre competition publicity appearance and amanda was only endorsing a campaign which she had signed up to before the games
2338961 with the cisco network solution weve achieved the holy grail of digital video which is the ability to perform shot selections on low resolution files and extract high resolution material from those files even as they are being recorded that is a huge accomplishment
2338962 cisco is a trusted partner and in the demanding it environment of the olympic games we depend on trusted relationships we have absolute deadlines for when olympics coverage begins and ends cisco technologies help us exceed expectations and meet our timetables in an unforgiving environment
2338963 we are making broadcast history executing the creation management and distribution of digital video in a way thats never been achieved before
2338964 we are entering the visual networking era where video changes everything especially the way people connect with the olympic games the olympics is all about the experience the next best thing to being in beijing is to be able to see the event coverage this year not only are thousands of hours of olympic coverage being transmitted in real time but ciscos ip video network and encoding technologies are also giving people the ability to access hundreds of event videos on demand using their pcs laptops and mobile devices for an unprecedented olympic experience anywhere anyplace anytime
2338965 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
2338966 its backed off some we are almost to the hospital
2338967 no were at the hospital hes totally non responsive they gave 5 more valium in the ambulance
2338968 ill let you know if anythiung changes still nonresponsive but starting to to try to focus his eyes cant squeeze pupils not dilated anymore
2338969 still not resting well but a little better than b4 still moaning and trying to get comfortable
2338970 just turned on his side and got in the poisiton he in we
2338971 my battery is dying call home number when you want to update
2338972 my battery is dying too so ill stay off the phone hes sleeping better now keeps trying to pull out the iv and will call you later i love you
2338973 how can you and amy hold it together when spencer is having a seizure
2338974 what do you do when you are not with your family and spencer has a seizure

2338976 an uncontrollable urge to clean ones house brought on by a desire to prepare a nest for a new baby
2338977 it was a gift i think its more your style than mine keep it youll like it
2338978 the room in which we stood we were standing because there was nothing to sit on seemed as though it were being just moved into you expected to smell wet paint suitcases and unpacked crates were the only furniture the crates served as tables one supported the mixings of a martini another a lamp a libertyphone hollys red cat and a bowl of yellow roses bookcases covering one wall boasted a half shelf of literature i warmed to the room at once i liked its fly by night look
2338979 this is a dump this is unbelievable but the kid dont know how to live even when shes got the dough
2338980 in this life you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
2338981 oh yeah they told us this would or might happen
2338982 still sovereign even when the darkness surrounds my life even when confusion has blinded my eyes
2338983 please wake up and smell the coffee before you get burned
2338984 furthermore the forbidden fruit tastes so sweet now in its early bloom has a nasty habit of leaving a very bitter after taste when the relationship crashes
2338985 while online networking does not replace human interaction it does provide candidates with an additional set of resources to create and maintain a personal brand and complement the profile they build through real world networking
2338986 one of the statements that he relayed to me that his children were in fact told by fbi agents that were doing the interview that their father was a murderer
2338987 and that i could tell greatly disturbed bruce as it would anybody
2338988 the notion that somehow these people were coerced by the agents or the lawyers is categorically false
2338989 these agents handled themselves professionally with great respect for mr ivins and his family and id say the same thing about the prosecutors in the case
2338990 she was manhandled by the fbi upon their entry and not immediately shown the search warrant her apartment was wrecked while fbi agents screamed at her that i had killed five people and that her life would never be the same again she was terrified by their conduct put into isolation for interrogation for eight hours
2338991 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
2338992 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them

2339003 a long time ago the elders and our ancestors learned to walk on the earth and to live in harmony they were taught the laws which govern everything and they were taught traditional values this wisdom should be made available to the younger generations
2339004 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2339005 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2339006 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that
2339007 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
2339008 microsoft doesnt care enough or else it would take all the consoles back and fix the rrod with better processing power and memory
2339009 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us

2339025 i heard you going on about how much you wanted to help me and yet sending me to that hideous medieval facility what was its name again
2339026 if the upright citizens of salem think i was difficult before they have no idea what is in store now
2339027 what did that homicidal maniac think that she could inject me and get away with it
2339028 tony thinks he should feel blessed to have his life back and he should think about his legacy he has an opportunity to prove he has a heart by calling off the
2339029 the old john wouldnt have let them stop hopes wedding
2339030 you almost looked as if you enjoyed it the old john would have done anything to protect them
2339031 dr johnson you will never know what i feel you saw what you wanted to see now get back to your patients
2339032 thats all right john you take all the time you need with her
2339033 you love that woman in there she will always be the great love of your life
2339034 but it might look a little better if you laid off the blonde dye for a while
2339035 at least you know i am a man of my word
2339036 this was not a random act of cruelty i made a promise to myself that i will return the favor to marlena and now i am making good on it
2339037 if you want to burn salem to the ground you have to go through me
2339038 who do you think i am phillip i wont let you turn salem into your carnival of horrors
2339039 what kind of crap are you spouting now you fool you have to decide which side you are on because the lines will be drawn
2339040 if the upright citizens of salem think i was difficult before they have no idea what is in store now
2339041 ill have to take the ginsu knives away from rolf
2339042 i heard you going on about how much you wanted to help me and yet sending me to that hideous medieval facility what was its name again
2339043 the minutes became hours the days became years it was like watching dool
2339044 she will always be the great love of your life john contemplates suicide
2339045 because i knew someone with a croaky voice just like that shes dead now throat cancer
2339046 and jane austen shes really good she wrote jane eyre you know
2339047 i went to the chanzy leezy a lot of people say that wrong you know
2339048 we face a looming global epidemic of alzheimers disease as the worlds population ages
2339049 by 2050 1 in 85 persons worldwide will have alzheimers disease however if we can make even modest advances in preventing alzheimers disease or delay its progression we could have a huge global public health impact
2339050 its advances in science pertaining to helping cure disease is about 1
2339051 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2339052 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2339053 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2339054 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2339055 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2339056 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury

2339217 these tunes and the songs ive done on my earlier albums have a certain elegance and romanticism to them that most of todays music doesnt have the writers who composed them were wearing suits and sportcoats to the session not jogging clothes i have to confess that before i recorded those tracks for father of the bride i was a rock and roll kid at heart and didnt know a lot of the treasures of the songbook but i quickly fell in love with the songs and they fell in love with me we rock kids thought we were so cool growing up in the 60s but these artists that came before that billie duke and louis armstrong theyre the ones that invented cool
2339218 my first taste of music came from those beaches i spent a lot of time listening to the hotel bands or the bands playing around the bonfires and cookouts there were beaches everywhere and i was always watching live musicians play so for inspiration for this album i went back to various beaches around the world in italy indonesia and elsewhere and just let the music flow

2339422 the business climate in washington is pretty challenging right now thanks to the seemingly endless amount of red tape the state forces you to go through to perform even the simplest of tasks
2339423 but we are confident that with just a little more effort seemingly endless can turn into literally endless

2339426 the quran has specified a considerable deal of its verses to talking about jews their personal qualities and characteristics
2339427 and verily we gave the children of israel the scripture and the command and the prophethood and provided them with good things and favored them above all peoples
2339428 that is because they say we have no duty to the gentiles they speak a lie concerning allah knowingly
2339429 the jews say allahs hand is fettered their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so nay but both his hands are spread out wide in bounty he bestoweth as he will
2339430 verily allah heard the saying of those who said when asked for contributions to the war allah forsooth is poor and we are rich
2339431 and of the jews listeners for the sake of falsehood listeners on behalf of other folk
2339432 and because of their breaking their covenant we have cursed them and made hard their hearts
2339433 their prophet said unto them lo allah hath raised up saul to be a king for you they said how can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is since he hath not been given wealth enough
2339434 distort the scripture with their tongues that ye may think that what they say is from the scripture when it is not from the scripture
2339435 and when ye said o moses we will not believe in thee till we see allah plainly
2339436 and when they fall in with those who believe they say we believe but when they go apart to their devils they declare lo we are with you verily we did but mock
2339437 enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget to practice it and ye are readers of the scripture have ye then no sense
2339438 when there cometh unto you a messenger from allah with that which ye yourselves desire not ye grow arrogant and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay
2339439 many of the people of the scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief through envy on their own account after the truth hath become manifest unto them
2339440 if a lucky chance befall you it is evil unto them and if disaster strike you they rejoice thereat
2339441 the jews and christians say we are sons of allah and his loved ones
2339442 and of their taking usury when they were forbidden it and of their devouring peoples wealth by false pretences
2339443 some of those who are jews change words from their context and say we hear and disobey hear thou as one who heareth not and listen to us distorting with their tongues and slandering religion if they had said we hear and we obey hear thou and look at us it had been better for them and more upright but allah hath cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not save a few
2339444 then even after that your hearts were hardened and became as rocks or worse than rocks for hardness
2339445 is it ever so that when ye make a covenant a party of you set it aside the truth is most of them believe not
2339446 they restrained not one another from the wickedness they did verily evil was that they used to do
2339447 ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than allah that is because they are a folk who understand not they will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from behind walls their adversity among themselves is very great ye think of them as a whole whereas their hearts are divers
2339448 and thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and greedier than the idolaters
2339449 or have they even a share in the sovereignty then in that case they would not give mankind even the speck on a date stone
2339450 therefore woe be unto those who write the scripture with their hands anthem say this is from allah that they may purchase a small gain therewith woe unto them for that their hands have written and woe unto them for that they earn thereby

2339500 it is the nature of our sport that we try and get our boxers to the top of their weight and it has been well documented that frankie has struggled with this over recent months
2339501 frankie has been working his whole boxing career towards the olympic games and he is obviously completely devastated i would ask that his privacy is respected during this difficult period and he is given the time to come to terms with the situation
2339502 my advice to him has been to take stock over the next couple of weeks and i will talk to him about his future as soon as i get home frankie is leaving a very talented group of boxers here in beijing and our focus has never faltered from making sure they have the best preparation and support to allow them to perform to the best of their ability in the olympic boxing ring

2339563 schuettlers improved ranking took him above compatriot denis gremelmayr who was ranked 66th when the draw was made but whose inclusion was not confirmed by the german national committee to the itfs chagrin schuettler whose claims have been upheld by the committee will now replace gremelmayr after successfully appealing to the cas court of arbitration for sport on the basis that several eligible players have withdrawn
2339564 the cas panel found that schuettler was among the top players eligible for the olympics according to the itf criteria set up in their rules and that there was a discretion in the german noc to enter the players of its choice from among such eligible players
2339565 the german noc did enter nicolas kiefer and schuettler but chose not to enter gremelmayr and michael berrer although both were ranked higher than rainer schuettler in the itf ranking list
2339566 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc olympic organising committee when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games every tennis event around the world uses the world ranking as the basis for entry and the itf finds it difficult to accept that criteria can be changed from country to country depending on the views of particular nocs the german olympic committee used their criteria to refuse the entry of gremelmayr who should have received direct acceptance under the itf qualification system the next german in the list was berrer who was six places ahead of schuettler at the entry deadline schuettler did not fulfil the entry criteria set by the german noc until well after the june 9 deadline and therefore should not have been considered for entry while recognising that the german noc may not understand how professional tennis works there is no excuse for schuettler who is prepared to take a place that was earned by his compatriot gremelmayr and of next alternate berrer the itf wishes him the best of luck even if he was not eligible for beijing

2339602 it should be a strong holiday for the format theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output

2339628 nbcs strategy is based on an end to end cisco architecture built on top of cisco routers and video encoding systems as well as our wan wide area network acceleration technology the cisco waas
2339629 this uses some key innovations the first and most important is a single unified network fabric built around the cisco 12000 router its a 450m bps network combining real time high definition broadcast contribution video voice and data from the points of creation into the studios in new york and los angeles
2339630 nbcs custom designed application tracks and documents literally millions of assets down to the individual camera and production equipment piece to coordinate all of the production and logistics around many events
2339631 it has to run flawlessly across various intercontinental links from china to several points in north america
2339632 this requires making low res copies of thousands of hours of competitions that are captured in our storage system in beijing and using a product called procast a video acceleration management product that proxies the images over to another media grid storage server in new york
2339633 we also have 40 at home editors we call them shot pickers using a vpn to either new york or la who make their shot selections using the proxies once they decide which shots they want to make a deliverable piece with then the system sends the proxies back to beijing to nbcs data center headquarters where the high res clips are called up from the main arrays to match the low res mpg4 proxies that have been selected

2339644 we look forward to putting this long litigation behind us and working collaboratively with the city to address our shared interests and concerns
2339645 because of the very serious concerns uc police had about the public safety hazard created by stretching these lines across a heavily trafficked city street
2339646 nothing in this agreement will keep uc berkeley from doing what needs to be done to end this dangerous illegal protest if the tree sitters refuse to come down voluntarily
2339647 we are very pleased with this decision and see it as confirmation that everything the university has done in connection with this project is fully compliant with the law and completely consistent with our desire to provide our student athletes with safe and suitable facilities
2339648 we look forward to the start of a construction process that will begin with the new student athlete high performance center and culminate with the seismic retrofitting and modernization of california memorial stadium
2339649 in the wake of this long and difficult litigation we also look forward to working with our neighbors and the city on building a strong collaborative relationship to address a broad spectrum of shared interests
2339650 we are pleased to be able to put this issue aside for now and discuss the concerns in a more measured and cooperative way once planning for phase 3 commences
2339651 we all agree this is at least several years away
2339652 we are avid supporters of cal football and the whole athletic program so we are pleased that the university has listened to our concerns
2339653 we are heartened that the university has stated its intent to work with us to preserve this unique football tradition and we look forward to a great season
2339654 it is time for this case to come to an end
2339655 it is time to end the grave harm that is being done to the campus
2339656 the university remains committed to ending the occupation while doing everything possible to ensure no one is harmed as a result of this misguided effort to protect a 1923 landscaping project
2339657 come down and continue this protest in a manner that is consistent with the law and respectful of the rights of others
2339658 we are moving to further stabilize the situation as we wait for further clarification about when exactly construction of the new athletic facility can commence at that point we expect the protesters and their supporters to join the university in its commitment to respect the judicial process and abide by the law
2339659 were pleased that our approach seems to be working as we move a few steps closer to a safe but certain end to this situation

2339663 uc berkeley understands the concerns of the berkeley city council regarding the safety and health of the people inhabiting the trees at memorial stadium
2339664 we continue to implore these individuals to end this protest and come down for their own health and safety in the event that they do not come down we will take appropriate measures to maintain their health and safety we will not however allow resupply from outside groups

2339668 the re introduction of foreign players will have advantages for our teams for our fans and for overseas marquee or emerging players wanting to experience the best provincial competition in the world
2339669 it will of course be tightly controlled and managed that is why we are still waiting on final details from management before endorsing the change

2339794 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
2339795 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
2339796 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

2339803 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
2339804 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
2339805 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto

2339892 whilst we welcome this disclosure reform the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children

2339897 from the first page of seaborn you are immersed chris howard navigates a wild ride through a brilliantly edgy and richly atmospheric alter world here is a fresh formidable spin on the fantasy genre and howard is a talent to watch out for seaborn will leave you spellbound
2339898 dark and atmospheric seaborn is an imaginative new entry in the world of paranormal fiction
2339899 seaborn is well written it is also downright creepy in spots mr howards description of both surface life and the expansive undersea world were detailed and vivid his knowledge of greek mythology and battle lore are formidable the scenes with corina and aleximor are particularly interesting as control shifts back and forth between them
2339900 seaborn is a mix of the little mermaid story tossed with a limb or two of zombies and entranced with a crimson droplet of i see dead people it is a refreshing step away from the clich vampire or werewolf book after all who really writes about things that go bump in the sea in a tale of two worlds colliding humans and the seaborn battle for the control of poseidons regime of the ocean while bits of environmental controversy ooze through the pages like a hidden agenda
2339901 seaborn is a unique fantasy its unlike anything else ive read chris howard tells a compelling story of merpeople and of two women who struggle to become their own woman or mermaid in the face of opposition howard does a fine job of describing the beauty and danger of the sea and the culture of the seaborn chris howard clearly knows a great deal about ancient greek mythology and occultism its unique and never feels like a warmed over version of anything else its for anyone who loves the sea and anyone who likes stories about young women striving for independence and their own power
2339902 seaborn is the first novel for chris howard and what an amazing tale it is from the underwater society to the surfacers on land the detailed account of preparation and battle is vividly drawn there are instances especially when they involve aleximor that are graphic in nature but theyre well within character the story is well paced action packed and laced with tension filled emotion there are also two distinct threads that come together as they lead up to a climactic battle and the author has done a great job of keeping them equally exciting this is a book id recommend to fantasy readers but horror fans should enjoy aleximor and corinas tale as well
2339903 seaborn is no regular fantasy about mermaids it is an epic created with a linguists a sociologists and a poets touch like all great epics there is intrigue upon intrigue and inter family relationships to figure out the seaborn have a long history and chris howard has created a rich complicated world it is also a poetically dense book in fact ill say it it is literary we are obviously in the hands of a great writer
2339904 murder and mayhem aside the relationship between corina and the possessor of her body is one of the strangest romances i have ever encountered in literature
2339905 chris howard takes urban fantasy where it doesnt usually tread
