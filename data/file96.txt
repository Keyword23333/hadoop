960001 nama yang engkau sembunyikan ilmunya dalam ilmu ghaib di sisi mu
960002 dan hanya milik allah al asmaaul husna maka berdoalah kalian dengan perantara menyebutkannya
960003 saya berpendapat al hawaalah mencari nama allah yang ada dalam cakupan al quran itulah yang lebih mendekati kebenaran
960004 dan janganlah kamu mengikuti apa yang kamu tidak memiliki pengetahuan tentangnya sesungguhnya pendengaran penglihatan dan hati itu semua pasti dimintai pertangungjawabnya
960005 maha suci engkau ya allah hamba tidak mampu menyempurnakan ats tsanaa sanjungan terhadap mu sebagaimana sanjungan yang engkau tujukan kepada diri mu sendiri
960006 segala sesuatu yang disandarkan kepada allah dalam permasalahan asmaa dan sifat adalah perkara

960033 people have had this suspicion that we are really close

960038 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
960039 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
960040 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
960041 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of
960042 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
960043 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
960044 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
960045 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
960046 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult

960070 im absolutely chuffed to bits with it to be honest the fitness levels the attitude the results and the performances that weve had weve learnt a hell of a lot from them
960071 we are talking about the president of the united states of america the leader of this country and the entire free world not the ceo of microsoft the president of the pta or the local church bazaar
960072 guess what honey i think i want to be president
960073 yes i am going to run and you are going to support me as i supported you through the monica scandal

960075 some were crying and others later walked out because of the way the government chief whip ms kabakumba matsiko was conducting business
960076 mr makubuya kept reading all our names as the chief whip kept asking those who signed to immediately withdraw their signatures not knowing that their withdrawal would not yield anything because the speaker had already signalled the house to meet
960077 she said she signed for a good cause and that she believes all others did likewise nothing would let her withdraw the signature
960078 members had come in the meeting because we knew something was wrong and therefore we expected the whole nrm house to put issues to order only to be humiliated and abused like children
960079 please help us we pass through a lot to convince the people to vote for the regime we sacrifice a lot yet government is wasting our efforts through its silly mistakes
960080 ms hyuha almost pounced on her seriously saying government had no reason to apologise
960081 this is the only way we can reward our footballers and also promote football
960082 this is the start of bigger things as we move towards rewarding our heroes these companies are friends of football
960083 we have always had trouble with kinyara especially when we start with them this time however we are very fit as we have been involved in pre season competition
960084 no doubt they ura are a better side and going by the names they are really good but we have also been preparing for them and we shall go for results
960085 those people in parliament like henry banyenzaki rubanda west theodore ssekikubo lwemiyaga sometimes emmanuel dombo bunyole and sometimes sam lyomoki workers i will fight you like i fought kony
960086 if such a meeting is not enough you can even ask for a week and we talk instead of using wrong procedures
960087 ssekikubo and ibrahim kadunabbi butambala should have called the caucus to debate this matter
960088 i dont agree with the cause of their petition because mengo issues begun long ago yet they had done nothing about them
960089 i am there to make a contribution and if the president thinks that i should be treated like kony then its regrettable
960090 that meeting the president had with katikkiro on thursday at state house entebbe over the mengo arrests was our own initiative and it restored his credibility and that of katikkiro then how can you say that i was wrong to push for the process the president was misled by self seekers but i am looking for an opportunity to give him my side of the story to say that he was going to fight me like kony who has icc indictments over his head was unfortunate
960091 he rushed out saying he had other commitments but he should know that unless a problem is solved his threats cannot stop us from distinguishing between right and wrong
960092 there is a problem within our party and the president should not blame mps for the party shortfalls
960093 there are some issues which are beyond the caucus and as a member of parliament you cannot go against the electorate for the sake of the party this would be political suicide
960094 katikkiro wanted us to halt this land bill but i rejected this idea because of the importance of the bill
960095 we cannot afford to stop this bill now because our people need it
960096 the president told the caucus that the katikkiro wanted the bill to be suspended until such a time when the national land policy is in place something he rejected
960097 we put it to the president that he must mend that relationship first to have things move
960098 central government should not expect to have a stable uganda without a stable buganda
960099 what they have done to these three kingdom officials has instead promoted them the more
960100 despite the arrests we are still firm and we know what we want
960101 i have personally not even moved an inch back we should remain united strong and focussed this time round we should retain all that belongs to buganda we shall not be threatened
960102 the recent arrests clearly show that we are being harassed for loving our kingdom and land
960103 but we shall stick to the issues till we win the battle
960104 this land belongs to the kabaka buganda government tree shed company has no authority over it
960105 i ask you to remain firm and use the available land maximally
960106 ugandans were lucky enough that they constituted their constitution to protect themselves and to enjoy their rights freely politicians have a big challenge to implement it evenly so that peace prevails
960107 and its freedoms and limitations should apply to everyone equally without discrimination
960108 as lawyers who handled the matter in public interest we did not receive any advance fees payment from any member of the public we therefore legally entered into remuneration agreement at 16 inclusive of applicable taxes because such agreements are provided for in the law which was registered with the law council

960151 without the rule of law there will be no end to injustice in this country
960152 the main problem in this country is that powerful people are above the law
960153 throughout our history the judges have supported the dictators now for once someone is challenging this impunity
960154 how can we have justice when our judges are not independent
960155 we were kept in a hall 70 of us there were no beds no sheets nothing so we had to sleep on the ground there was one bathroom for everybody they wanted us to accept that we were disturbing the peace we refused eventually they let us go because they couldnt charge us
960156 if they are not returned we will recommence our civil disobedience
960157 close to 200 studies on the cdm have been carried out since its birth in 1997 the main finding is that left to market forces the cdm does not significantly contribute to sustainable development
960158 and unlike the credit crisis no injection of capital will be able to turn the clock back on an ever decreasing window of opportunity to meaningfully address the climate crisis
960159 it is now increasingly difficult to step onto the property ladder and enjoy the benefits that homeowners take for granted what theyre discovering is that while there may still be a property ladder the lower rungs have been removed
960160 the combined total of capital gains tax arrangements land tax exemption and negative gearing arrangements is estimated to be in the order of 50 billion per year
960161 societies spanning the full range of economic development people average about one hour per day travelling this is the travel time budget
960162 simply capitalised into soaring house prices rather than leading to a wider and fairer spread of owner occupation
960163 there is no question that more liberal loan policies were the proximate cause
960164 what the 20 markets that have lost the most affordability have in common is excessive land use regulation
960165 areas of anti narcotic enforcement suggest prohibition as a major cause of addiction
960166 pumping bail outs of taxpayers money into their banking system
960167 rental yields are still quite low in the order of 5 and even lower for low rent housing
960168 if it works tax it to death if it still shows signs of life regulate it and if it dies completely well then subsidise it
960169 attampts to destroy reasonable returns on property ownership through regulation against reasonable rentals will simply have no other effect than to reduce the demand for and hence the supply of new housing

960174 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
960175 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
960176 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
960177 right now we want residents in travel trailers to have a more permanent residence to go to if necessary
960178 if people see water in the roadway they should not drive through because it would probably be saltwater and damage their vehicle
960179 i remember sitting here in 2005 after winning the june race and this track is real gratifying to win here a lot of great drivers have done very well here and it just means a lot to be on the list of people who have won here
960180 osborne did a great job i wasnt so sure about halfway through when were yelling at each other but bob did an unbelievable job
960181 the rain comes and were not sure what we wanted to do
960182 it was a stressful day but it worked out for us we both had a good time doing it and thats why were here to win and have a good time
960183 i love road courses theyre a lot of fun weve historically had pretty good luck at both sonoma and watkins glen were leaving here with a smile on our face and looking forward to next weekend
960184 scares a lot of people when i streak through my neighborhood
960185 thats where a lot of the big foot sightings have come from in the past eight years
960186 we were in a window right to make one more stop and it worked out really good at the end
960187 we dont give up i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were done
960188 to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me at the beginning there i was just up underneath somebody and think the no 78 just got in the back there we all kind of got jammed up i dont think it was anybodys fault but it worked out good we were able to work on our car and just kept making it better all day
960189 i hate it for these guys but i told them to be proud of what we did do dont be disappointed about what we didnt do we did some great things today i am proud i appreciate them letting me drive the car

960191 we have to really look at it we lost about five seconds and we think it is partly temperature
960192 when you get these high temperatures you get a bit of pressure coming out of the tank with the fuel we cant cool it that much and everyone was struggling toro rosso honda and williams had some issues
960193 the commission found that comcast monitors its customers connections using deep packet inspection and then determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents
960194 in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein the commission also found that comcasts conduct affected internet users on a widespread basis indeed comcast may have interfered with up to three quarters of all peer to peer connections in certain communities
960195 provide internet users with the opportunity to view high quality video that they might otherwise watch and pay for on cable television such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service
960196 we set a precedent on what isps can expect moving forward and we would consider fines in the future where we find violations but because this is the first action we took we are giving comcast an opportunity to say how and when they will stop these practices
960197 the company initially claimed that it did so interfered with attempts by customers to share files online using peer to peer applications only during periods of peak network congestion and of heavy network traffic
960198 later confronted with yet more evidence suggesting that interference was not limited in this manner comcast recast its position yet again and admitted that it interferes with peer to peer traffic regardless of the level of overall network congestion at the time and regardless of the time of day
960199 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
960200 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
960201 in a perfect world we would give free bandwidth to everyone in the current environment it comes down to who will pay for supporting the content online the user or the isp

960208 there are no words sad doesnt do it justice i will always remember skip for his humor and his ability to go about life the way he did i gained so much respect for what he did and how long he did and how he did
960209 i figured skip caray is as much a part of atlanta braves baseball as any of us
960210 we all grew up listening to skip whether it be on tv or radio any time the guys on espn imitate you calling the highlights youre pretty much a legend from a fans standpoint hes going to be a huge loss for them because he relayed the games to fans for so long
960211 he always made a note to come by my locker and shake my hand ask me how i was doing how the family was how my kids were
960212 personally over the last 15 16 17 years i havent gotten his play by play on the radio or tv but i had a lot of plane flight conversations with him i really respected him as well as the whole caray family they have a pretty good legacy working over there its a sad day for braves baseball
960213 this was completely unexpected and is a complete loss i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
960214 but behind the humor there was an honesty and a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
960215 if he didnt like it that a game was two minutes late getting started everybody knew about it if he had an opinion on a player he said it and he had a way of saying it that was sometimes humorous the way he could take a bad ball game in some of those bad years especially and turn it into a fun broadcast whether it was by talking about something in the game or whether it was talking about something that didnt have anything to do with the game maybe it was a movie that was coming up after the game or maybe it was a restaurant that hed gone to it could have been anything he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one the game was still the most important thing but if game was decided by the fourth or fifth inning people would still watch the rest of the game just to hear what he had to say about things thats a very very unique ability
960216 regardless of how much you prepare yourself for it youre always surprised
960217 skip of late seemed to be doing a lot better his immediate future was off of everybodys minds its a surprise a shock
960218 we were able to joke around with one another laugh at one another and we also had a mutual respect for one another
960219 ill miss that seeing him around the game taking a jab or two
960220 for so long he was what people associated with the atlanta braves
960221 turn on tbs and there was skip good times bad times that was the constant the voice people identify the braves with is skip caray thats going to be missed
960222 not only are the braves losing somebody special from their organization baseball is too
960223 its wild how when somebody spends so much time in one organization and has had the history that hes had its very difficult to have it abruptly end especially while hes doing it
960224 unfortunately he ended up dying doing something he loved itll be a tough day a tough week
960225 the estimates from our nations new hiv incidence surveillance system reveal that the u
960226 many populations at risk are not being reached by our prevention efforts and much more must be done for example recent data indicate that in the past year 80 percent of msm men who have sex with men have not been reached by the intensive interventions we know to be most effective
960227 this illustrates one of the many challenges to preventing the spread of this disease the challenge of reaching new generations while adapting to the evolving epidemic
960228 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
960229 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
960230 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation cdcs prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for hiv prevention at the cdc

960251 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
960252 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

960792 and im a sheepdog i live to protect the flock and confront the wolf
960793 what goes on around you compares little with what goes on inside you
960794 i want to say thank you for finally shedding some light on why it is that i can do what i do i always knew why i did it i love my citizens even the bad ones and had a talent that i could return to my community i just couldnt put my finger on why i could wade through the chaos the gore the sadness if given a chance try to make it all better and walk right out the other side
960795 dear god i wish i could have been on one of those planes maybe i could have made a difference
960796 do you have any idea how hard it would be to live with yourself after that
960797 here is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men
960798 i will never be caught without my gun in church
960799 do you have any idea how hard it would be to live with yourself after that
960800 do you have any idea how hard it would be to live with yourself if your loved ones were attacked and killed and you had to stand there helplessly because you were unprepared for that day
960801 i was always afraid of dying always it was my fear that made me learn everything i could about my airplane and my emergency equipment and kept me flying respectful of my machine and always alert in the cockpit
960802 denial can be seductive but it has an insidious side effect for all the peace of mind deniers think they get by saying it isnt so the fall they take when faced with new violence is all the more unsettling denial is a save now pay later scheme a contract written entirely in small print for in the long run the denying person knows the truth on some level
960803 the sheep generally do not like the sheepdog he looks a lot like the wolf he has fangs and the capacity for violence
960804 we listened to a lot of people saying dont touch that
960805 but we borrowed out of it and were retired and just fine
960806 we paid the loan back in about a year but after we were done we started looking at what we had lost by not having that money in the stock market
960807 for us it would have been smarter to have lived in an apartment for a couple of years and just saved for a down payment
960808 but before you tap the plan you want to make sure that youve thought it through small decisions made today can have enormous consequences
960809 i just want to alert people to the true cost
960810 i had all these papers that said what we would have had if we hadnt touched that money but i dont think were ever going to look

960858 i am going to the range every day and they are really very good
960859 its first class the food is very good with so much variety transportation is good and we are entertained well by the hosts there is no complaint at all
960860 its hot here at this time of the year but it is good for us last time when we came here it was freezing cold which had affected our performance
960861 this is definitely one of the more unusual shoots ive taken part in but also one of the most enjoyable
960862 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl indian premier league are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the 2020 olympic games
960863 over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
960864 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
960865 i do hope that even if and when the ruling is against the players that the clubs would say ok we are now right and we were right to attack
960866 both barcelona and schalke are scheduled to play champions league qualifying matches during the olympics and they could lose out on millions of euros dollars if they fail to reach the group stage blatter has argued all along that club teams must release their players under a fifa statute
960867 im a little bit surprised the clubs are taking such a strong stance i would say not only against fifa but also against the players
960868 the players deserve also respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
960869 when cas is taking a decision we are bound by that decision
960870 it is the interest of the clubs to combine them with the interest of the national teams and here we must find the balance
960871 i dont think anyone will win eight but if there is any person on the planet that can its michael phelps
960872 i dont think he cant do it i just dont think he will look at the competition
960873 there is a lot of competition even in the events he is really strong in they are going to be tough races for him i think it is going to be the schedule that makes it difficult he also has to rely on relays
960874 i think the competition for him is tougher here than what it would have been in athens certainly
960875 i am going to tell him if i see him before the competition that if there is anyone that is going to do this it would be you and i would like to watch it happen
960876 its a great one for livening up the press thats about it
960877 for the most part we are good friends but we like to beat them everyone likes to beat the americans

960881 my dad made me realize what things are really worth
960882 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
960883 lomong was one of the lost boys of sudan separated at the point of a gun from his family at 6 escaped with other kids to a refugee camp in kenya then given a new life by adoptive parents in america at 16
960884 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country
960885 from that point on i was like man i want to go to the olympics
960886 the best thing that could happen for me is winning the gold for the united states
960887 being an american is not something im going to take lightly when i took that oath i meant every piece of it
960888 watching these naturalized americans in the same event will offer a refreshing reminder of what the olympics are supposed to be about
960889 when i told them i was going to run they were actually kind of mad at me like what are you doing
960890 but when they noticed where this could take me they changed they became totally supportive
960891 lagat has the best chance of becoming a true olympic star he will run in the 1 500 and the 5 000 the longer race is his specialty and having been to the olympics twice before and winning silver and bronze he knows what its like to get close
960892 this is very special running tonight now im part of the usa going to beijing im very excited
960893 i have different roots leo has different roots bernard has different roots
960894 i feel happy because to be no 1 is hard work for a long long time but there is no time to be excited and be happy and enjoy i have olympics in one week im playing the best summer hard season in my life im very happy for that i won wimbledon and i won toronto then i played cincinnati there is no time to enjoy anything i have to be very focused all the time
960895 im in a good position a very good position the goal is only to keep playing like this and continuing to improve my tennis i want to have more chances to keep winning important tournaments on this hardcourt surface
960896 we are now just days away from what i believe will be a historic olympic games
960897 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
960898 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
960899 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
960900 rogge cited the may 12 earthquake in sichuan province which killed almost 70 000 people and praised the

960906 our health care system has some series issues and is in process of being completely socialized by nanny state loving democrats if this election goes as history tells us it will then the democrats will own the congress and the white house when the republicans owned this they tried to pass some common sense legislation much of which managed to get shot down by procedures that the democrats used to outmaneuver the republicans the dems didnt step on this legislation because they thought it was a bad idea they stepped on it because they knew it would help the system and this would prevent them from hitting their goals of course the republicans could have used a bit more leadership to get more legislation passed but they werent very good at their jobs and now some of them are working at foxnews

960940 he had suffered serious head injuries these amounted to six separate lacerations that required 30 stitches and he was detained at inverclyde royal
960941 he was taken to the southern general hospital in glasgow for surgery but developed complications and slipped into unconciousness
960942 four days later he died neurosurgeons opinions differed as to whether the assault was the mechanism which resulted in the brain injury which led to his death
960943 he grabbed me by the chest and i clocked a wine bottle which i picked up and hit him with i dont know how many times maybe three or four

960949 as unison members have now returned a yes vote for industrial action and agreed to join the gmb and unite unions who have already agreed to take industrial action then the three trade unions must now give the council at least seven days notice of their intended strike dates
960950 this will apply nationally as this is a national pay offer the council will then begin discussions with trade unions regarding maintaining essential services on these dates
960951 the council would hope as many of its employees as possible come to work on these dates in order to minimise disruption to the public

961093 we are not in the business of putting jobs at risk as has been insinuated by some commentators and unions will behave in a responsible manner should companies be in genuine financial difficulties

961144 we felt like this was an offense that under our standards called for termination
961145 it was incredibly poor judgment once he received that on state e mail which was outside his control to forward it to the five or six people he forwarded it to

961183 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high

961187 if we had not accepted public funding we would have had on hand enormous resources and when those swift boat attacks came we would have dealt with them in the medium in which they came which was paid television advertising
961188 its a testament that this guy can make tough choices
961189 there was not a direct link the truth is that i provided legal functions for them
961190 i didnt deal with the messages and i was very careful to make sure there was no co ordination between the two in terms of their messages and activities

961206 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
961207 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
961208 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
961209 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
961210 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
961211 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
961212 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
961213 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
961214 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
961215 hes had one days rest and he pitched five innings just two days ago
961216 in the past three days hes thrown well over 100 pitches
961217 but his stuff was working and he was locating his pitches well today
961218 eighty percent of his pitches were off speed and we just told the guys look for it and if they hang it you hit it
961219 this is a total team win especially with the pitching staff
961220 usually when you see a shutout its one pitcher throwing a complete game today we had three pitchers gutting it out
961221 patinskas was pitching on no days rest after throwing yesterday he hasnt thrown all season because he had a broken wrist and he did the job two days in a row

961231 i was intimidated by the size of these women i never would have tried out
961232 we all started on the same level and we all grew together
961233 you dont have to be polite its a huge release for me and i get to wear cool outfits
961234 our intent is to raise 150 000 pounds of fresh produce on the farm annually and make it available first and foremost locally in the mad river valley and washington county and then also to other food shelves and pantries around the state
961235 its a way for us to sustain a sustainable source of fresh produce for the people we serve often times its the fresh produce that doesnt make its way into the shopping cart of needy vermonters because its unaffordable so they lose access and they lose the nutrient value of produce in their diet
961236 this farm is right on route 100 its got great access for people to see and drive past and its a gateway to the mad river valley
961237 my feeling has always been that were not taking business from local farmers because the pie is getting bigger as people realize the importance of eating locally
961238 its increasingly unaffordable for us to take fresh produce from outside the state so we need to gather as much locally as we can the short term gain is significant and the long term gain is well continue to have the fresh produce and the educational opportunities to better understand the issue of hunger
961239 youre saving on gas youre cutting out the middle man youre producing it as cheaply as possible and itll give you the food you want its a win win win situation
961240 this is well within the realm of the sorts of things weve been supportive of but i just dont know how competitive the next round of funding will be

961253 i just look at them and are they able to learn hows their attitude
961254 theyve had a great attitude this entire camp theyve been willing to do everything we ask of them because we dont ask rookies to do just one thing we ask them to do a b c and d we want them to do all those things well
961255 we sort of pressure other players to work as hard as we do
961256 we ask them if they did as much as we did to day its sort of a little game this is what we did what did you do this is what time we came in how about you we challenge the younger guys to make them see that the work doesnt stop when you get to training camp it just starts

961293 we are in a state of good relations with the clubs and im a little bit surprised that the clubs are taking such a strong stance not only against fifa but also against the players
961294 i think the players deserve a little bit of respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
961295 the accreditation process has already been completed and they cannot be replaced
961296 the three players are here they are training so please let them play
961297 the olympic games is something which enhances a players career former striker juergen klinsmann said that the best thing which ever happened to him in football was winning bronze at the 1988 olympics
961298 the olympic games started in 1896 and i think the olympic spirit should be maintained im sure they the clubs can afford to be without one player
961299 perhaps when they come back from the olympics they will be new players and a more valuable asset to their clubs
961300 a couple of weeks ago it was all about usain and i was enjoying myself in the background

961322 im writing these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god im doing it so you will
961323 if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with god and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
961324 and by that will we have been made holy through the
961325 4for while we are in this tent we groan and are burdened because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life 5now it is god who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come 6therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the lord
961326 13 and you also were included in christ when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised holy spirit 14who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are gods possession to the praise of his glory

961340 wing places are where people might go instead of applebees
961341 chicken companies have really boosted prices because of demand and there are only so many wings a chicken has
961342 its not like chicken fingers which can be made out of various parts of the chicken wings are not the cheapest part of the chicken but theyre very popular now
961343 we cant wait until we see our buffalo head mascot in every major city across the united states
961344 and thats one of the reasons why i wanted to come back home
961345 everyone was like did you even take bp or hit in the cage
961346 we thought he was so valuable because he can play short third and catch
961347 he can hit and play all the positions and thats what we need right now
961348 hes one of those big bats that can help in this lineup but its a day at a time right now as we work through some injuries and other issues
961349 everyone was like youre going to have a terrible season

961353 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
961354 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
961355 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
961356 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
961357 political tap dancing that attempts to mask his plans to expand government is what we expect from an inexperienced candidate like barack obama
961358 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
961359 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
961360 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
961361 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
961362 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
961363 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
961364 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
961365 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
961366 im glad im an american but our countrys going to be a third world country before we know it if someone doesnt do something
961367 when you look at the fact that the 18th district can be a net producer of energy that can both create needed jobs and help alleviate concerns in the economy about energy costs and the loss of jobs
961368 us lower income people theyve got to reach out more to us
961369 i want to vote for the one who can do more for the ones that need it

961394 they uzbek authorities may have calculated that the blasts would be viewed as the handiwork of international terrorists
961395 on the surface its all fairly civilised but in practice things are dysfunctional and strained

961401 it has been an honour and mostly a pleasure to chair sccc through the most successful years in its long history
961402 in recent months i have had to take a health induced sabbatical due to having three major operations in a ten week period i am now recovering but will not be fully fit to resume my duties for some months to come i have therefore decided it is in the clubs best interest that i stand down as chairman i will stay on as a main board director both of sussex and the ecb for as long as i am required
961403 under davids leadership sussex achieved unprecedented success winning three county championships in five years this will stand in the history books in addition david worked tirelessly behind the scenes in particular his drive to create the youth ground at blackstone near henfield the new indoor school at hove and ensuring we maximised the spen cama their benefactor inheritance are evidence of his contribution to sussex cricket
961404 i am honoured to be elected by the board there is no doubt that county cricket faces an exciting but challenging future uncertainty at international level coupled with domestic restructuring in 2010 means that at sussex we will have to be smart to remain a top county off the field the challenge of redeveloping the ground at hove and improving the trading performance are two topics high on the agenda
961405 it is with regret to learn that david will be stepping down he has been a great asset to the club i am delighted that he is to remain on the board
961406 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
961407 i would like to thank both michael and paul for their outstanding contributions to the leadership of the test and the one day teams i am delighted that they will both continue to make themselves available for selection as players
961408 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
961409 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
961410 i learnt to play cricket here and was picked for the national team while playing for bengal i feel i have some moral responsibility towards the state
961411 being a member of the bengal team which performed poorly last year i feel i should try my best to guide the team back to the super league
961412 i dont think so if players like mahendra singh dhoni or s sreesanth could come up then why wont i be able to do the same my aim is to perform consistently
961413 true improvisation is getting on stage and performing without any preparation or planning

961415 we both miss it and had an opportunity recently to do some for the goba great ohio bicycle adventure bikers when they came through and we thought it would be great to do on a regular basis
961416 i hope to get more comfortable getting up on stage and in public speaking
961417 this has been a nice introduction and i hope we build on it
961418 its been so much fun just doing it here on a small scale and i can imagine how fun and entertaining it would be on a large scale
961419 ive always loved whose line is it anyway and seeing them do improv on a large scale
961420 i hope to improve my improv skills ive never done it formally but just hanging out with friends and making stuff up and having fun with them
961421 you get to know how a persons inner mind works you know faces and names and maybe that someone you work with is married and their kids names but improv is getting down to the thoughts that drive you
961422 some like to play it small and safe and others like to go for the really big idea
961423 they have been doing it for years and people love it
961424 most of the ducks dont even make it they get hung up on the rocks or just get stuck in a dead spot

961434 das ist der nationalstolz der pl tzlich ausbricht bei allen das alle so konsequent ihre uniformen tragen
961435 das entlockt mir ein schmunzeln in den ersten tagen war es wirklich so dass im olympischen dorf im gro en esenssaal dort die blauen sa en und dort die orangen aber jetzt hat diese euphorie schon etwas nachgelassen
961436 ich wei nicht ob sich das noch massiv ndert wenn es richtung erste wettfahrt geht wir werden jedenfalls versuchen alle potenziellen st rfaktoren auszuschlie en ob das jetzt materialm ig ist oder das verstehen der str mungsmuster
961437 seit wir hier angekommen sind man merkt schon dass es etwas besonderes ist ich f hle mich pudelwohl im olympischen dorf es taugt mir total das ganze team wohnt auf einem stock man sieht sich trifft sich f r mich ist das total angenehm
961438 aber das segelrevier ist immer wieder eine gew hnungssache es ist von den wellen und vom segeln her sehr anspruchsvoll es ist nicht so dass du aufs wasser gehst und sagst mei easy ich finde das schon eine richtig gute competition
961439 am letzten tag vor der regatta das ist normal so und w re komisch wenn es nicht so ist aber das ist eh ganz gut dann wird nochmals alles angekurbelt du denkst noch einmal alles durch beim boot schaust den wetterbericht an und so weiter
961440 ich segel schon sehr lange und kenne sehr viele leute die bei den spielen waren f r mich ist bis jetzt nix berraschendes passiert
961441 wir haben viele leute im team die das schon fter erlebt haben mit denen plaudert man schon dar ber wir haben viel geh rt wie es sein wird und versucht uns so gut wie m glich darauf vorzubereiten und auch das boot damit wir keine berraschungen erleben es ist vieles anders aber bis jetzt ist noch nichts passiert was wir nicht auch so erwartet h tten
961442 am liebsten sitze ich vor dem fernseher folge gebannt den veranstaltungen und heule jedes mal wenn die nationalhymne gespielt wird

961459 er hatte nie angst davor mit seinem kampf und seiner meinung alleine dazustehen
961460 ich denke dass seine bewertung der fr hesten sowjetischen epoche doch tendenzi s und einseitig war
961461 nat rlich sind die bewertungen mit seiner pers nlichen trag die verbunden aber dem leben und den heldentaten des ganzen volkes dem sch pferischen potenzial dieses gro en landes darf man nicht sein pers nliches schicksal aufdr cken

961495 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
961496 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
961497 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
961498 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

961594 a man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return so he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas put this money to work he said until i come back
961595 but his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say we dont want this man to be our king
961596 he was made king however and returned home then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money in order to find out what they had gained with it
961597 he replied i tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but as for the one who has nothing even what he has will be taken away but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me
961598 those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me

961657 the decision to use an asymmetric cpu by sony was a wrong one
961658 dat is een makelaarssite met 57 woningen daarom komt miljoenhuizen met 170 000 woningen niet eens voor in het onderzoek daarnaast zijn er bij het berekenen van het aantal woningen per site verschillende fouten gemaakt
961659 de zoekfunctie is zeer goed de woninginformatie en de buurtinformatie zijn goed en de site is effici nt duidelijk en overzichtelijk
961660 het grote aanbod en het feit dat alle woningen voorzien zijn van fotos en vanwege de handige manier om de zoekvraag te beperken als je kijkt naar het aantal punten verschil met jaap dan is dat verschil minimaal
961661 dit gaat over het algemeen via deeplinks maar het heen en weer klikken is minder effici nt de site is zoals ze ook zelf aangeven een zoekmachine en wijkt dus enigszins af van de opzet van de andere sites
961662 brixter heeft als speciale eigenschap dat ze een indicatie geeft van de waarde van alle 3 7 miljoen koopwoningen in nederland ook als ze niet te koop staan
961663 frustrerend is vooral als het gevonden droomhuis al verkocht blijkt te zijn een huizensite moet niet alleen een compleet en actueel aanbod laten zien maar ook goede zoekmogelijkheden bieden en de site moet vooral snel zijn
961664 nu er serieuze concurrenten zijn voor funda biedt dit makelaars een alternatief en de onderlinge concurrentie van de huizensites leidt voortdurend tot verbeteringen in de manier waarop de informatie wordt gepresenteerd
961665 de vraag is wat er met de kwaliteit van de woninginformatie op sites als zuka en jaap gaat gebeuren als de rechter oordeelt dat alleen een thumbnail en 155 tekens mogen worden overgenomen van andere sites ontstaat er dan een ander beeld
961666 nadat in de woningmarktmonitor van miljoenhuizen op 1 juli al geconstateerd werd dat de verkooptijden sterk toenamen is de laatste maand de ontwikkeling van de vraagprijs in negatieve richting omgeklapt ten opzichte van 1 augustus 2007 is er nog steeds een stijging van 4 procent te melden maar de lichte daling is in heel nederland ingezet een gemiddeld huis staat 149 dagen te koop op 1 augustus ten opzichte van 133 dagen op 1 juli daaruit volgt dat vraag en aanbod nog niet in evenwicht zijn en de huisverkopers de prijs verder zullen moeten laten zakken om deze te verkopen

961669 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
961670 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano

961680 first it is in the public interest that the wife and children of a divorced husband should not be left dependent on public assistance or on charity when he has the means to support them
961681 accordingly any provision which purports to oust the jurisdiction of the court to hear an application for ancillary relief is void
961682 we are not suggesting for a moment that a judge would simply reach a conclusion without regard to the other s
961683 it does seem to me that the role of contractual dealing the opportunity for the autonomy of the parties is becoming increasingly important
961684 if this had been a pre nuptial agreement it would have stood the best chance of being enforced if there was i full disclosure ii a proper period for reflection being at least 28 days prior to the marriage iii proper independent legal advice with proper negotiations iv no children born after marriage
961685 should not the parties to the marriage or the projected marriage have at the least the opportunity to order their own affairs otherwise by a nuptial contract
961686 it does seem to me that the role of contractual dealing the opportunity for the autonomy of the parties is becoming increasingly important
961687 any agreement entered into between the parties to the marriage in contemplation of or after the marriage for the purpose of regulating their affairs on the breakdown of their marriage which shall be considered binding upon them unless to do so will cause significant injustice to either party or to any minor child of the family

961689 the ridiculous result of confining the wife to the pension of a german judge whatever that may be
961690 in those circumstances in my opinion it was entirely a matter for the judge to set this factor into its proper perspective i cannot see that the weight that he elected to give to this agreement is open to criticism

961704 there has been a migration of functions and authorities from u s civilian agencies to the department of defense
961705 i dont understand why bad things always happen to me

961707 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
961708 big surprise a true soul healer comes here from far away australia
961709 i have decided to make the mp3s of disc one of theweareallgoingtoburninhellmeggamixx2 tour only limited edition double disc cds available for free letting fans who werent able to go to the shows hear this stuff
961710 they know what it costs to produce electricity from wind so when they deem it necessary to increase the price you know it is needed
961711 failure is the only opportunity to begin again more intelligently
961712 c truespace76 not putting it in the logical program folders place second how many file menus does a program need trying to just find a place to import the 3d studio max file was difficult eventually i realized i wanted the other file menu the left file menu not the right file menu
961713 im also a big believer that financial debt is the ultimate dream killer your first house car whatever stuff you might want to buy are going to be the primary reasons you stop looking for what makes you the happiest
961714 supposedly not budged an inch on their environmental views in the last dozen years i chose to disagree study the picture below of a gallup poll describing the environmental sentiments of americans that has been taken each year for the last 19 years
961715 i read with glee your report of ufos in last weeks paper i suppose it makes good press
961716 they were indeed fire lanterns only 18 not 30 as claimed that were set off by a wedding party taking place at the oakwood centre
961717 fire lanterns are regularly mistaken for ufos and there are more of them and this is thought to be due to the increase in immigration they are often amber and circular but the real giveaway is they follow the wind
961718 there is enough evidence to suggest ufos definitely exist whether in a physical or psychological dimension and most of them are doing exactly the same behaviour throughout history
961719 there is speculation about everyone not just me i have had it for the last two years now and i will just get on with it the chief exec can say what he likes about my future i wont be commenting on it i will just focus on my football
961720 i am concentrating on getting fit and i will let other people waffle on its all just paper talk
961721 i have been with reading a long time weve got a good group of lads but what the future holds no one knows
961722 everyone wants premier league football we want to get back there and hopefully we will
961723 but its gone for the moment these things happen we werent good enough last season all we can do now is try to get back up
961724 global investment flows into renewable energy companies reached 100 billion
961725 its a massive game as both sides are desperate for the points but we are looking forward to it
961726 we are in the position now when we have to play good cricket
961727 we have done that for the last two weeks with little reward but a couple of our players are coming into form
961728 we are not worried about our position and we are focussed on getting out and performing better than we did in the first half of the season
961729 if we do that then things will take care of themselves
961730 we were disappointed to lose having been in the game so strongly for so long heinrich batted nicely and we bowled ok conditions were perfect because it was turning and bouncing but we werebeaten by a brilliant performance from barker
961731 im a critic of the loan system but in certain situations it can really help develop young players
961732 reserve team football is not what it should be and last year we loaned him out to bournemouth and millwall and hes getting stronger better and more confident
961733 he has been involved with us right from the first day of pre season
961734 hes a very determined young man and he showed that in his performance
961735 hes got a great engine and you need that these days to be a modern midfield player so were very hopeful hell play a role this season
961736 lets hope the mentality he has now is maintained through the whole season because his goals could be significant for us
961737 he hasnt run now for a fortnight or maybe longer so its difficult to see a situation where he can get three weeks of fitness in three days
961738 there has been a lot of speculation but thats all it is
961739 it can drag on a little but i have come back for pre season and will work hard and see what happens
961740 i want to get back in the premier league but if i stay here then i will work my butt off to get reading back in the top flight that is my honest opinion
961741 where would i be without reading i have come a long way in the last couple of years and obviously i still want to progress
961742 there are boundaries you can cross to get out of a football club but i wont step over that line
961743 i am not looking to cause trouble i will just work hard i live in a great area and i get paid well to do a job i love its a great life
961744 its also great having my brother here i have always wanted to play in the same side as him and now it has happened

961746 i would like to sincerely thank everyone for their kind words and deeds through this emotional time
961747 i know that his wife cathy mum celia dad mike and sister dorothy have found the support given by daves many friends and hells angels brothers a great source of support and we all know how very much more difficult it would have been to get through this period without your very kind help
961748 it is true to say that the hurt was eased by the expressions of love and kindness from daves very many friends
961749 special thanks indeed to the hells angels from distances near and far for their unequivocal support
961750 my sincerest gratitude and very best wishes to you all
961751 a third crossing would ease congestion and increase economic prosperity across the whole area the plan has stalled since the 1920s
961752 each time the plan has been supported by the berkshire authorities who have seen it as essential however it has always been thwarted by oxfordshire council the reality is the third crossing is a key component in a wide range of factors contributing to the economic prosperity of the area and oxfordshire as well
961753 a third thames bridge has been on the wokingham agenda for many many years and is still on the agenda as priority number one
961754 the simple fact is we all have to compromise or see our economic prosperity stall falter and then die and the oxfordshire authorities will not be immune from this impact
961755 there is an infrastructure in place for a bridge including the building of the a329 m and we are going to continue to press for it
961756 at the end of the day we will all suffer without a bridge
961757 our concern is that a third crossing will lead to extra congestion in the area
961758 we are obviously happy to meet with our colleagues from reading and wokingham what we need to make sure is that roads within our area do not receive extra traffic
961759 we need to ensure if this bridge is to be built the infrastructure is put in place to support that
961760 we were good going forward in stages a little erratic with our passing but it was a friendly
961761 it was like a testimonial so you cant take a great deal from it but it topped off a decent preparation after what might have been a very unsettling period
961762 the players have applied themselves and we can look back on five weeks and say its gone okay
961763 you cant take anything from pre season results we just hope were ready to go on sunday
961764 with three games in six days were straight in at the deep end
961765 instead of getting a tan like most of the boys im in the gym pushing weights its very dull and tedious but harps has livened me up he is nuts great fun to be around
961766 to be involved i will need to play before then

961837 sanjay dutt was finalized in a mature role for sanjay gadhvi directed kidnap the film was supposed to have two heroes a much younger actor along with sanjay dutt shree ashtavinayak cine vision ltd was keen to sign up shahid kapoor who had then just started shooting for their film jab we met because they were impressed with his professionalism
961838 but dutt bluntly and categorically refused to work with shahid kapoor he told them anyone else but shahid would do there was surprise all around because no one heard of a problem between dutt and kapoor
961839 deferring to dutts wishes the producers proposed kunal khemmus name kunal too was at that time doing a film for them the rohit jugraj directed
961840 the role required a young but tough lad and despite his chocolate cream hero exterior imrans audition convinced everyone that he could pull if off easily and he was signed on
961841 shahid inadvertently offended dutt while working with him on vaah life ho to aisi
961842 shahid played the role of a young lad who dies suddenly and dutt played a modern day yamdoot assigned to shahid almost all of dutts scenes were with shahid but during the breaks between the shots shahid would mostly keep to himself and not go beyond exchanging pleasantries dutt felt slighted at being ignored by the junior star to make matters worst the film flopped
961843 salman who did not work with kareena kapoor since kyon ki 2005 because of her relationship with shahid has agreed to work with her again following her break up last year
961844 shahid is a reserved person who doesnt take liberties with any of the senior co stars he has always been in awe of sanjay dutt and he maintained his distance out of deep respect his deference was probably miscued by dutt

961849 one of the worlds most extreme anti israel academics gordon belongs to the class of rabidly anti israel far left professors whose trademark is the delight they take in comparing israel to apartheid south africa and nazi germany
961850 with the protesting and this and that we need to get a real strong jewish studies program in there hopefully it will be enlightening to have a visiting professor and itll calm down over there more
961851 this trend has come about because of the success of some israeli retail companies at building chains in israel they saturate the market here and go abroad
961852 we think we have the right concept healthy food all of which is prepared on the premises including all breads and baked goods were very satisfied with the business weve been doing in new york and toronto
961853 this year we plan to open two more locations one in ny and one in toronto were also going to penetrate the european market with branches in cyprus and in romania
961854 i have no doubt that the majority of businesses are expanding on their own capital theyre not getting financing abroad which is risky but then again most are slowly opening stores and paying rent after a year if its not successful you can leave so its not that risky
961855 we first got the idea of expanding abroad in 1996 when a couple from japan stopped at our flagship store in tel aviv
961856 they were so enthusiastic about the merchandise and asked permission to sell it back in japan since then there are now 13 points of sale there as well as one in taiwan and one in singapore which this couple still holds the franchises for
961857 we began selling michal negrin products in the us in 2001 in the showroom in new york then stores like neiman marcus bloomingdales and saks fifth avenue began picking up our merchandise finally in 2003 we opened up our first concept store in manhattan we find its the best way to tell our story we have the same store design in every location all over the world thats the beauty of it
961858 michal brings something different to fashion jewelry something in the colors and the mix of materials she uses shes got an extraordinary ability to see details our merchandise is geared toward the high end everything is handmade and we produce everything in israel every piece is done personally and in a gentle manner by craftsmen who care about their work
961859 we dont market aroma as being israeli we dont want just israelis to be coming
961860 its clear that its an israeli designer and there are some customers like jewish organizations and supporters of israel that come to us because they know were an israeli company but most people come to us for the quality
961861 i dont think it matters in retail if youre identified as israeli at least in central and eastern europe something israeli is considered american and thus a higher quality
961862 israelis underestimate that people abroad generally have a good impression of israel

961897 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
961898 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
961899 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
961900 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
961901 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
961902 while its important to have an actual game within the game
961903 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
961904 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
961905 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not
961906 our industry right now is hungry for another round of innovation

961909 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops

961931 perhaps we are sell outs as we put fashion aside for the sake of our profession but i like to see these corporate goths as being intelligent enough to know when to adapt to ones surroundings to take advantage of the benefits the mundane world can offer after all looks alone does not make a goth
961932 anna was the first to experience strange things the girl put the skull near her bed before going to sleep anna said that she dreamed of the life of indians who had lived thousands years ago and the girl could describe the dream in detail strange dreams haunted the girl each time she had the skull near her bed new dreams brought more new details about the life of indians details unknown even to scientists
961933 first art critic frank dordland started investigating the strange skull after a closer investigation he discovered that the skull had a complicated system of lenses prisms and channels creating unusual optical effects the investigator was surprised to discover no signs of processing on the skulls perfectly polished surface they couldnt be seen even with a microscope frank dordland even addressed hewlett packard the famous company that specialized in crystal oscillators at that time for a competent examination of the crystal the results were shocking not only for the scientist himself the research by hewlett packard in 1964 in a special laboratory revealed that the skull had been made long before the first civilizations appeared in that part of america where the skull was found in addition rock crystal of such perfect quality couldnt be found in that area the most amazing thing was that the ancient skull weighing 5 13 kg 203 4 mm long and 125 4 wide had been made of a whole crystal this fact contradicted the laws of physics
961934 a kind of a prism was found at the back bottom of the skull any ray of light that strikes the eye sockets is reflected there if you look into the eye sockets you may see the whole room reflected

961943 citizens of islamabad gather outside civil junction to celebrate diwali in solidarity with the honourable justice rana bhagwandas our courageous prisoner of conscience who was forced to celebrate this significant event at home
961944 we wanted to show that we pakistanis do care about the fact that he has been kept away from celebrating the most holy day in his calendar just because he refused to let this regime do whatever it wanted this goes against the basic fundamental rights of citizens it is truly unfortunate that it has come to this imagine someone stopping us from celebrating eid
961945 if anything my family would be more pro government i myself have supported musharraf in the past but this is not a party issue this is a principle issue the government keeps saying that it has given so much freedom to our media but then it has taken it all back so much more aggressively
961946 this is something you would expect from your own musicians
961947 and that is the beautiful thing about these students they are so much more conscientious they have no party affiliation just a purer kind of gut reaction which the older generation is starting to lose
961948 for gods sake this country is in crises musicians and actors who are pro musharraf have such warped ideas seriously its like theyre living in their own lala land they really need a reality check
961949 we want to put an end to dictatorship an end to these media curbs we want to protest against professional people being arrested and put behind bars and we resent the fact that this situation is being taken for granted
961950 we want to express that everything is not okay we the youth of this country are taking notice of whats happening and we stand behind the lawyers they are professional educated people and this is how you treat them
961951 what was i doing that was so wrong apart from protesting peacefully and if one person is put behind bars people are still going to come out
961952 where consumer market is considered its business as usual but with corporate clients its a wait and see policy right now projects are happening but sooner or later business will be hit if television channels dont come back on pakistan is never short of excitement when it comes to politics but right now the situation is pretty desperate everyone has their fingers crossed lets see and hope for the best
961953 i think this is very unfortunate political leaders make statements as if they are the only ones trying to improve the image of the country theyre not we are trying so hard as well we represent our country every time we step outside even when i went to dubai for the recent fashion week everyone was asking me about the situation in my country and i tried to sound so hopeful but now i dont think any buyers would be interested in coming to pakistan now we are back to square one
961954 the important factor is that our people are full of energy we are used to political instability so we turn our back towards it and carry on and we must also realize why this emergency was imposed it was just a judicial extravaganza our president is into art and culture and modernization so life is not disrupted im producing a farcical comedy during these times because i feel that being a third world country we need to laugh more
961955 i think these channels were misusing their freedom if youre a music channel and you start showing slides of news reports at the bottom then youre obviously pushing your boundaries life is going on its not a curfew its an emergency the countrys respect is ultimately in your own hands so you shouldnt try to degrade it and cross limits of the freedom that this government has provided to you
961956 pull the trigger disconnect your head from your bodykill your team with a chainsaw for my comfort
961957 i dont blabber about money and clubs like the rappers today do i stick to keeping most of my music raw and dirty
961958 primarily known for their public feud with eminem a few years ago
961959 a person in their management approached me and my rap friend b leave he asked us to spit verses on an unreleased project of theirs which they might put out in the future so he emailed us the song and we sent it back after we recorded it were in touch on and off
961960 i bang with rap cuz its the best way to express how i feel the rap game is all about being on top and destroy any niggaz career whose tryin to limit your digits its either you on top or get knocked
961961 as far as rock goes i dont wanna hear that sh around me
961962 i see myself in the field of media and entertainment releasing my own albums making films being single and enjoying myself touring with a band signing young talent writing and selling hit pop tracks to singers who cant write their own stuff probably acting too
961963 unfortunately mma put a ban on general artistic expression discouraging a lot of people when there was no association with art some people even turned to drugs in their hopelessness
961964 the reason our music gets recognized is because its in english and its from peshawar
961965 the music scene here has not developed as such there are only sporadic bands here and there theres jehangir aziz who is very talented and one band called az for whom im producing a couple of songs most of these kids are really young around 20 to 21 years old
961966 nazeef is the vocalist and guitarist rhythm lead while i am responsible for the bass drums keyboard synths
961967 we used to have a lot of opportunities back then to go up on stage and give it all i also performed at the british council it was then that everyone actually acknowledged rock music in peshawar
961968 recently i was selected as a judge in a music competition held in fast university one could easily see the talent peshawar has that day basically the musicians over here arent given much to work with because of the conservative attitude from people
961969 if you could only hear jehangir perform live you would be amazed that someone from pakistan at such a young age can sing an english rock song that good
961970 no one knows about musicians in peshawar but theyre really good kids like shahab whore mostly into rock are very talented but its still a new thing for peshawar
961971 you cant ever expect rock to capture a commercial crowd in a country like pakistan
961972 we are doing it for us if i wanted to make more money i wouldnt do music this is for our own sense of personal achievement
961973 i feel comfortable with english culture is basically following your own comfort level
961974 radio one was supposed to come to peshawar but even they are now skeptical looking at the situation in the city
961975 there are seriously speaking no venues for musicians to perform at and i surely hope that there would be a platform for talent because in a place like peshawar its so easy for such art to be ignored and eventually wasted
961976 there exist political student federations in most of the universities of peshawar who are severely against musical events and other entertainment related gatherings several incidents are known when they tried to spoil and stop such events by force and even carried out physical violence upon students who participated in them this has not just created a fear among the students but also the university administration they no longer provide funds for entertainment related societies since they are unable to guarantee the students protection
961977 unless youd want to invite the mma along to make it oh so much more exciting
961978 there are a lot of musicians around who can actually play and make sense out of what they are doing if only they are given the opportunity i dont think they are given much to work with as they are all trying to stick to the system and gain its approval the system is made in such a way to not encourage such an activity and is not at all supportive it almost seems as if its something insulting and inferior only the very few driven can actually ignore such a response and continue with their work though things are changing because of mtv pakistan but it still seems like it has a long way to go
961979 when i started my career all members of my previous band rungg moved to lahore we knew there is no music scene in peshawar there is talent for sure but no nurturing of it i was amazed to see the difference outside peshawar especially in islamabad where fellow musicians alone gathering at normal gigs number at around 200
961980 its a hindrance yes but we just cant leave peshawar
961981 there is immense amount of potential in peshawar ali noor has said that the crowd here is amazing junoon used to come here there used to be a mixed audience people are dying for entertainment only if the elders here recognize it a lot of people want to pursue their interests but the traditional community just tries to sway them away

962005 my educated guess is that its the effects of severe stress but the fact of the matter is there arent any institutions willing to put money into the research its always aids and a cure for cancer everyone wants to be a superstar

962031 there is no such thing as a little bit of prairie chicken habitat
962032 these birds need large expanses of open land to thrive we have only relatively small isolated patches of prairie left in missouri in public ownership that means that public private partnerships are absolutely critical to success for prairie chicken restoration
962033 you dont have to build a fence around land and never touch it again
962034 prairie chickens can coexist with farming and other land uses sometimes restoring their habitat is as simple as burning small areas each year we work with farmers and ranchers to find ways to make room for prairie wildlife while still making money
962035 prairie is one of the least appreciated natural systems in missouri
962036 it isnt like craggy mountains that jump out and grab your eyes as you drive past you have to stop and get out of your car to appreciate the majesty of grassland and the astonishing variety of plants and animals that live there half of missouri historically was grassland of some kind we stand to lose this treasure piece by piece if we dont act now to save all the pieces

962166 in 2002 the gap between the performance of free school meal pupils and non free school meal pupils in maths at key stage 2 was 10 percentage points its now 15 in science the gap was 16 points its now 20
962167 and in the last year for which we have figures nearly half of all pupils eligible for free school meals didnt get a single gcse at c grade or above 47 of fsm pupils thats 33 909 pupils without a single qualification at the basic level the government deems acceptable
962168 by contrast the number of free school meal pupils at the other end of the achievement spectrum the number getting 3 as at a level was just 176 thats fewer than 1 of those getting 3 as
962169 the sad truth is that if youre eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass above c than you are to get 3 as at a level
962170 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
962171 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs

962175 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices and we have recognised this with an impairment charge of 527m on the goodwill of our north american personal financial services business at group level
962176 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cuttting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
962177 todays results come as no surprise to us hsbc has a thriving and extremely valuable business in asia which is why its share price has performed as well as it has in 2008 relative to that of other banks
962178 we would point out however that the subprime and other credit related losses incurred by hsbc in north america since the beginning of 2006 now exceed 32bn that is to say more than all the profits earning in the emerging markets and hong kong over the same period
962179 on the positive side the rate of deterioration has definitely slowed but we have had two quarters of seasonally good factors with tax refund season at the beginning of the year and the fiscal stimulus package in the second quarter

962184 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
962185 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from secondhand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes

962215 die vorhandenen gegens tze zwischen den aktion ren lassen mich meine pflichten als finanzdirektor nicht unparteiisch erf llen
962216 in der ersten h lfte des jahres 2008 pr sentierten sich die finanzm rkte so problematisch wie seit jahrzehnten nicht mehr
962217 in asien ist es offensichtlich dass die aktivit t der unternehmen im vergleich mit dem vorjahr abgenommen hat auch die nachfrage nach aktieninstrumenten f r die verm gensbildung ist r ckl ufig
962218 da sich das wirtschaftswachstum in den usa und europa abschw cht und in asien die inflation zulegt d rfte sich das gewinnwachstum abschw chen allerdings er ffnen sich durch diese entwicklung auch chancen f r neue investitionen
962219 wir rechnen damit dass das us gesch ft 2008 und 2009 verluste schreiben wird aber wir sind der ansicht dass hsbc pragmatisch vorgeht und die herausforderungen versteht

962233 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
962234 studies confirm that when unbiased health professionals armed with educational materials provide guidance to doctors they are more likely to purchase the best drug for the patient instead of the best deal for the pharmaceutical company
962235 office calls work thats why they are the preferred sales tactic of industry
962236 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
962237 providing doctors with information based on independent clinical research will help patients get the best treatment and improve safety and affordability of healthcare for everyone

962243 asset quality although strong by sri lankan standards weakened in fy07 as evidenced by a gross npl loans ratio of 3 7 percent at fye07 up from 0 97 percent at fye06
962244 the deterioration was primarily a result of increased delinquencies on credit card advances residential housing loans and loans to medium sized corporates
962245 due to hsbc sri lankas increased focus on mobilising long term deposits the share of time deposits has also been increasing and comprised 67 2 percent of total deposits as at fye07

962325 if there is an opportunity i will do it in person
962326 if not then over the phone hopefully hes man enough to accept our apology we lick our wounds and move on
962327 ireland has no other option at that point there are no recourses for him he cant go to replay
962328 that individual wont be named as its hard enough to attract young officials to the game without persecuting them publicly but well let our clubs know how it will be handled internally
962329 i could say a lot of things but i guess thats what happens when youre the grey cup champions everybody loves you
962330 he was getting into it with an o lineman and the guy just chucked him and he went into the ref

962346 la anses tiene superavit de 12 mil millones de pesos
962347 lo fundamental es que la anses tiene superavit de 12 mil millones de pesos y este es el dinero de los jubilados esperamos que el gobierno no manote esta caja
962348 queremos atar la jubilaci n al sueldo porque el proyecto del gobierno plantea dos ndices de actualizaci n el primero es de movilidad salarial pero el segundo est atado a la recaudacion por lo tanto volvemos a algunos criterios de los 90 si hay plata pagamos y si no hay plata no pagamos eso es muy peligroso
962349 el segundo criterio es la intangibilidad de los fondos esos 12 mil millones s lo se pueden usar para eso siempre hay una tentativa de echar mano a eso
962350 esta designaci n es un mensaje del gobierno a favor de la concertaci n el mismo d a que me nombraron a m nombraron a oscar gonz lez un hombre del socialismo para trabajar en el gabinete de ministros

962352 el estado de sospecha y de inconveniente permanente no hace f cil la permanencia en un cargo y por eso creo que puedo contribuir m s con mi renuncia que con mi permanencia en el cargo
962353 gobernar en un clima de sospecha pensando que est rodeado de traidores de golpistas
962354 si el gobierno piensa en una concertaci n sin cobos ser a una concertaci n s lo con los que han dicho que s a todo
962355 si hay intentos de desarmar una concertaci n plural nosotros vamos a tratar de construir una concertaci n plural con quien la quiere construir esperemos que el gobierno no siga en un grado de autismo importante y reaccione en alg n momento

962430 there has been one constant fact in this business for the past four or five years
962431 between 17 and 18 percent of users who are coming up for renewal of antivirus products choose not to renew with vendor thats a high churn rate
962432 from a technical side ill do anything for a client
962433 im a 55 year old man who does nothing but provide a service for a client its not rocket science
962434 my experience with other vendors in the antivirus space has been that they took large companies direct and threw us the crumbs
962435 a lot of the crumbs enabled us to make money each week and fund the staff we had working on the product then vendors took the crumbs away

962456 i dont know what those photographs might say and i dont necessarily see a lot of them
962457 i have heard of them but i disagree when i have been with kirstie she looks terrific

962460 the judge believed it was enough the period that he served in prison
962461 they have released him and he is on his way home
962462 were trying to get something together for him to stay for a period of time hes coming back to me today id like him to be around but hes been thinking about it over the weekend
962463 it would be a short term contract but i dont know what he wants to do at this stage of his career the offers there and id like him to earn a longer contract but the decision is with him
962464 if he comes id be thrilled if he doesnt then so be it he loves it here and he wants to stay but its up to him what he wants to do
962465 im not really interested if he has other offers its whether he wants to be here with us
962466 remember constant chatter is not the same as a life of substance actually it is quite the opposite
962467 it is ending up where you began but knowing the place for the first time
962468 when i look back on my college days maybe it was a different era in the late 60s but most of my fraternity brothers didnt have criminal records not yet most of them even those who were in rotc and hunters but the behaviors they exhibited werent the kind of behaviors that gave me confidence that packing guns in their lockers or in their rooms would make me safer
962469 rather than creating safe zones for victims we may unintentionally be creating safe zones for criminals who are doing the attacks and who have less to worry about
962470 the media likes to paint us as paranoid about mass shootings on campus
962471 what we are more concerned about are the types of crimes that happen on a daily basis on our campuses across the country these crimes are rape assault robberies these are things we should be able to protect ourselves against
962472 allowing handguns does provide extra protection and extra deterrent against crime
962473 its not a one stop solution but provides a deterrent and i feel very comfortable with people who have fulfilled their requirement to be able to carry
962474 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
962475 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
962476 if anyone brought a gun to class id be scared out of my mind regardless if they are trying to stop someone who is shooting someone or not
962477 at the moment theres a weird over patriotic atmosphere over there like were number one and the rest of the world doesnt matter
962478 will force me to injure or kill someone in self defense
962479 they are going to be what they are going to be i have no control over it i dont know what they are i dont believe they are going to find anything
962480 im telling everybody get off your explicit and look for my granddaughter
962481 im not going to let it suck me dry dont get caught up in all this stuff because the truth will come out
962482 shes just a precious little angel that needs support from all around
962483 its been longer now starting to get a little more scary
962484 what they do with it i have no control over
962485 my wife and i cried when we read that article what they told us of how it was going to be put together was totally different
962486 frankly every day is as hard as the first day
962487 everybody says and theyre wrong if they say it we know how you feel

962492 if she writes something we want to make sure it gets in the right hand too we dont want someone reading something who has no authority reading it
962493 um well when i get a chance to actually write a little bit more i should be able to do that within the next little bit because i have i guess quote rec time

962500 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
962501 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
962502 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
962503 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
962504 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

962509 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
962510 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
962511 a few months ago will take to the tracks during november and december
962512 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
962513 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
962514 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
962515 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
962516 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
962517 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
962518 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
962519 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
962520 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
962521 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
962522 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
962523 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
962524 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
962525 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

962528 the alliance party will not be taking the policing and justice ministry this executive is failing in its duties so northern ireland needs a strong and coherent opposition we are providing that opposition and we will continue to do so
962529 the executive is in crisis over planning the environment the 11 plus irish language and the multi sports stadium issue do the executive parties expect us to take the environment education and culture ministries to save their bacon on these matters
962530 i just got my very first new car brand spanking new out of the box
962531 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
962532 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
962533 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
962534 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
962535 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
962536 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
962537 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
962538 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
962539 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
962540 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
962541 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
962542 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
962543 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
962544 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
962545 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
962546 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
962547 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
962548 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
962549 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
962550 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
962551 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
962552 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
962553 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
962554 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
962555 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
962556 who are open to doing something on the production side
962557 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
962558 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
962559 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
962560 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
962561 jeg vil ikke afvise at du kan finde mig i et konsortium sammen med andre der g r ind og byder p kmd
962562 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
962563 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
962564 thanks for the homo sapiens solidarity mccoy but why dont you guys go back to your
962565 you want to sell cute n cuddly kittens with that
962566 and food just like kittens do in other words america is one big violent hungry kitten that wont accept devalued american currency thanks to eight years of insane fiscal policy by people who hate everything america stands for oh and we love this kitten
962567 possibly of alien origin we dont know what kind of permanent effects that can have on either the hypnotizer or the hypnotizee ill get right on that
962568 i knew a minister of ufos would come in handy okay what about puppies
962569 thats not very positive and you didnt even address puppies
962570 everyone hates the cincinnati bengals why not have an ad with someone flipping off mccain while youre at it
962571 lets hold off on the one fingered salutes im not running the fcc yet and we dont have cheneys oil money to pay the fines thats why
962572 relax gang birds and puppies arent even necessary we simply show johnny in his natural habitat thats enough to scare the bejeezus out of anyone just watch the reaction of the test audience
962573 scares the hell out of me too lets get back to being positive for a moment something not so frightening how about moonbeams
962574 jai compris aux discussions que jai eues avec ma maman quil tait temps que jarr te
962575 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
962576 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
962577 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
962578 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
962579 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
962580 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
962581 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
962582 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
962583 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
962584 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
962585 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
962586 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
962587 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
962588 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
962589 bernie mac is still alive and being treated at a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery
962590 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
962591 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
962592 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
962593 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
962594 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
962595 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
962596 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
962597 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
962598 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
962599 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
962600 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
962601 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
962602 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
962603 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
962604 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
962605 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
962606 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
962607 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
962608 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
962609 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
962610 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
962611 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
962612 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
962613 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
962614 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

962699 and thats a drag because we used to be able to do it without sponsorship now we cant so the world turns but you still keep doing it because i love jazz and ill keep doing it as long as i can i have these new people with me now and that helps me
962700 some people i dont even know who ive never heard play which is good thats the way it should be
962701 when it comes to newport jazz i dont let anybody take over
962702 hey what else you get to be 82 you take it day to day
962703 i was just in there practicing when you called ive got to keep my hands in shape
962704 lo hago para oponerme a esta locura y para romper con la ilusi n de que todos estamos a favor de esta guerra innecesaria basada en mentiras
962705 todo es una locura la ocupaci n la forma inhumana en que tratamos a los palestinos
962706 en israel entras al ej rcito con 18 a os porque quieres luchar contra el enemigo de tu pa s porque quieres dejar tu marca en la historia y haces lo que te dicen sin pensar y all todo te ayuda para que no pienses misiones que cumplir rdenes que seguir
962707 y no ves a los palestinos como seres humanos los ves como animales entras a su casa durante la noche los despiertas les gritas las mujeres all los hombres all y rompes todo son cosas que no har as aqu en israel pero las haces all y para poder hacerlo niegas la realidad es la nica forma creas entre t y la realidad un muro de silencio
962708 te pongo otro ejemplo si encuentras en la noche un paquete sospechoso que puede ser una bomba llamas al primer
962709 y tambi n en nablus cuando quer a entrar a una casa si pensaba que pod a haber una bomba trampa cog a al mohamed de turno y lo obligaba a que abriera la puerta es parte de la rutina del ej rcito usar a los palestinos como escudos humanos
962710 lo mismo cuando est s en un check point los obligas esperar mucho m s de los necesario a veces durante horas y coges a un palestino al azar y le das una paliza de cada quince o veinte que pasan para que el resto tenga miedo y est tranquilo s lo as t que est s con cuatro soldados m s los dominas a ellos que son miles
962711 y cuando entras a gaza con el carro de combate y ves un coche nuevo aunque tengas espacio en la carretera pasas por encima y tambi n disparas a los tanques de agua para meterles miedo para que te respeten porque esa es la l gica de lo que nos ense an a los soldados israel es
962712 adem s eres joven y empiezas a disfrutar de ese poder de que la gente haga todo lo que les digas es como un video juego est s en un check point en medio de la ruta tienes a veinte coches esperando y con s lo mover el dedo hacen lo que t quieras juegas con ellos los haces avanzar retroceder los vuelves locos tienes 18 a os y te sientes poderoso
962713 tres meses antes de abandonar el ej rcito dirig a una unidad en hebr n hab a hecho una buena carrera as que ten a tiempo libre una ma ana me mir ante el espejo y comprend que todo aquello era un error y supe que no podr a seguir adelante con mi vida si no hac a algo por eso apenas sal junto a los soldados de mi unidad montamos una exposici n con nuestras fotos se llamaba traer hebr n a tel aviv
962714 cay como una bomba en la sociedad vinieron parlamentarios periodistas pasaron siete mil personas entonces creamos breaking the silence donde damos espacio para que los soldados cuenten los abusos que cometen sistem ticamente m s de 350 lo han hecho ahora tenemos exposiciones y v deos en europa en israel
962715 alguna gente dice que son casos aislados las madres dicen mi hijo que est ahora en el ej rcito es bueno no hace estas cosas esto s lo lo hacen los soldados beduinos o los et opes pero no es cierto todos las hacemos porque es la l gica de la ocupaci n israel aterrorizar a los palestinos
962716 los check points no sirven para detener a los palestinos de entrar a israel es para que la realidad no entre a israel porque esta es una sociedad de soldados todos pasamos por el ej rcito tres a os cuando somos j venes y luego un mes al a o y todos hacemos eso por eso existe el muro de silencio de negaci n porque todos somos responsables y no lo queremos admitir
962717 ellos son las v ctimas nosotros los victimarios pero como victimarios tambi n pagamos un precio esta es una sociedad que no se anima a mirar a los ojos a la verdad a sus propios actos es una sociedad como consecuencia moralmente enferma

962719 las dos explicaciones principales que se han propuesto para la dicotom a hemisf ricas son alg n tipo de proceso interno que cambi una de las mitades del planeta o un gran impacto en uno de ellos
962720 el impacto tendr a que hacer sido lo suficientemente grande como para hacer estallar la corteza de la mitad del planeta pero no tan grande como para fundirlo todo demostramos que realmente se puede formar la dicotom a en esta forma
962721 las dos aproximaciones son muy complementarias coloc ndolas juntas te da una visi n completa
962722 el modelo bidimensional proporciona alta resoluci n pero s lo puedes observar impactos verticales el modelo tridimensional te permite ver los impactos no verticales pero la resoluci n es menor de forma que no puedes rastrear lo que sucede en la corteza

962742 aphorisms on naturphilosophie contained in the jahrbucher der medicin als wissenschaft
962743 philosophische untersuchungen ber das wesen der menschlichen freiheit und die damit zusammenh ngenden gegenst nde
962744 all in all only a small part of that treatise is concerned with freedom its main content is rather an extended report about a god with whom the author reveals an intimate familiarity since he even describes for us his origination it is only a pity that he does not say even in a single word how he arrived at this familiarity the beginning of the treatise consists of a web of sophisms whose shallowness will be recognized by anyone who is not intimidated by the audacity of the tone
962745 history as a whole is a progressive gradually self disclosing revelation of the absolute
962746 now if the appearance of freedom is necessarily infinite the total evolution of the absolute is also an infinite process and history itself a never wholly completed revelation of that absolute which for the sake of consciousness and thus merely for the sake of appearance separates itself into conscious and unconscious the free and the intuitant but which itself however in the inaccessible light wherein it dwells is eternal identity and the everlasting ground of harmony between the two
962747 has creation a final goal and if so why was it not reached at once why was the consummation not realized from the beginning to these questions there is but one answer because god is life and not merely being
962748 only he who has tasted freedom can feel the desire to make over everything in its image to spread it throughout the whole universe
962749 as there is nothing before or outside of god he must contain within himself the ground of his existence all philosophies say this but they speak of this ground as a mere concept without making it something real and actual
962750 the godhead is not divine nature or substance but the devouring ferocity of purity that a person is able to approach only with an equal purity since all being goes up in it as if in flames it is necessarily unapproachable to anyone still embroiled in being
962751 god then has no beginning only in so far as there is no beginning of his beginning the beginning in god is eternal beginning that is such a one as was beginning from all eternity and still is and also never ceases to be beginning
962752 bring those foreigners with you too they need to learn what tango is

962756 how can you dance like a man and think like a woman

962758 find someone to take care of you someone to love you dont be alone the tango is not enough
962759 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective

962776 we are at a critical moment in our nations history
962777 to compete and win in the 21st century we must ensure the united states capitalizes on the extraordinary economic technological and societal opportunities presented by broadband the benefits are undeniable and compelling
962778 todays broadband is tomorrows traffic jam unless we continuously invest innovate and improve our networks ability to handle the traffic
962779 the good news is that our nation has all of the technological capability and necessary capital resources with wise public policy america can meet this challenge
962780 in the first citation of its kind californias labor commission on friday fined a santa clara based company 4 000 for violating a state law that requires employers to reasonably accommodate employees who are breast feeding the commission cited international security services inc a private security firm after investigating a complaint by one of its employees the woman who was not named in a press release said she had to express breast milk in a room monitored by security cameras and didnt get the time she needed

962782 hey sue i ran out of half and half hope you dont mind i used some of your soy milk
962783 oh havent seen that before i guess i see and learn something new everyday
962784 the problem arises because breastfeeding is sex specific and therefore challenges the feminist principle of gender neutral childrearing it is an even more difficult problem than pregnancy because whereas pregnancy is necessary for childbearing many do not consider breastfeeding to be critical to an infants survival at least in industrialized countries
962785 breastfeeding is seen as a gender difference that stands in the way of liberating women bottle feeding in this perspective would be seen as liberating
962786 cultural feminism strives to reconfigure social and economic structures to accommodate this gender difference without resorting to biological determinism
962787 when we trust the makers of baby formula more than we do our own ability to nourish our babies we lose a chance to claim an aspect of our power as women thinking that baby formula is as good as breast milk is believing that thirty years of technology is superior to three million years of natures evolution countless women have regained trust in their bodies through nursing their children even if they werent sure at first that they could do it it is an act of female power and i think of it as feminism in its purest form
962788 things do not have to be the same to be fair

962793 where did the reported number 20 000 come from if that represents the 1 percent mentioned by apple it translates to apple having over two million subscribers to its mac mobileme services something apple had not disclosed before
962794 the mac to mobileme transition was a lot rockier than we had hoped but everything is now up and running
962795 we want to apologize to our loyal customers and express our appreciation for their patience by giving all current subscribers an automatic 30 day extension to their mobileme subscription free of charge

962815 this place of rest was chosen by alexander isayevich himself while he was alive
962816 is a heavy loss for the whole of russia we are proud that alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn was our countryman and contemporary we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
962817 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
962818 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people who lived through this but were not broken
962819 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
962820 born a year after the russian revolution for the very long years of soviet terror he incarnated dissidence
962821 it was alexander solzhenitsyn who opened the eyes of the world to the reality of the soviet system giving a universal reach to his experience
962822 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
962823 the state the city or someone has to agree to the funding or we wont go ahead with it
962824 our mission is not to run a planetarium building it is the cheapest part running it is the expensive part
962825 two months ago i was giving the chances for the project on a scale of one to 10 an eight now i would give it a two or a three the funding isnt there
962826 we dont want to be surprised down the road because we know that once we say the planetarium can move forward we are the public sponsor and owner
962827 we dont want to be in a position where operating costs are higher and we either have to close the facility or ante up more money
962828 a tremendous amount of synergy between the planetarium and the library as it relates to a family friendly venue in downtown minneapolis
962829 im hoping that we can cobble together the additional votes we need to move this forward
962830 we want to work with the county to make sure that this gets done and it gets done in minneapolis

962855 there seems to be this code of silence or lack of trust of the police people dont want to tell the police anything
962856 the allegations levelled against me are baseless and politically motivated and that the complainant is an outright liar working hand in glove with those in power to assassinate my character

962883 the real causes of the trouble were due to an effort on the part of bacon to bring retribution upon the indian tribes around jamestown who had riden and massacred many of the whites berkeley sided with the indians
962884 after john vivians investigation of the facts he became heartily in sympathy with colonal bacon and the colonists
962885 governor berkeleys niece diana cummings was also in deep sympathy with bacons cause and opposed to the tyranny of her uncle
962886 tradition says that the information vivian obtained was largely through diana cummings
962887 diana cummings being warned of this fact and knowing her uncles deception imparted the information to captain john vivian and requested him to ride to
962888 captain vivian and his friends rode rapidly back to jamestown gathering as they returned colonists along the route some armed with primitive flintrocks cutlasses etc
962889 they rescued colonel bacon took possession of the ship advanced on the palace captured governor berkeley and made his sign officially attaching the seal of the king bacons commad making him colonel in command of all the virginia forces
962890 when bacons rebellion subsided and conditions quited down captain john vivian married diana cummings and settled in that portion of virginia known as middlesex co
962891 their daughter diane vivian married garrett minor and their son john minor was the great grandfather of the present well known vivian minor fleming historian of fredericksburg virginia mr vivian m fleming is the authority for the above romatic story of diana cummings and captain john vivian

962944 as dice el se or dios de israel d ganle al que los ha enviado que yo el se or les advierto voy a enviar desgracia sobre este lugar y sus habitantes seg n todo lo que dice el libro que ha le do el rey de jud
962945 voy a apartar de mi presencia a jud como lo hice con israel repudiar a jerusal n la ciudad que escog y a este templo del cual dije se ser el lugar donde yo habite

962951 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
962952 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
962953 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny
962954 she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
962955 for a lot of reasons but mostly because i dont like the path this countrys on and if mccain is elected well be continuing down that same path
962956 maybe because the speakers are no longer muffled by piles of papers
962957 it doesnt get much simpler than that and what makes things right when we are walking in obedience to god when we are living life aligned with his will

962964 when i was ten years old i was led to give my heart to god it was not a form of giving my heart to god i knew then that i needed a savior three different years i went forward to the altar and prayed and prayed until a man came and laid his hand on my head and said why little girl god is here and ready to forgive your sins
962965 a great many persons have said mary should be at home with her blind mother i have been so happy to receive her letters in which she tells of being able to give a message for the first time to those darkened minds and hearts i think you will agree with me that this is the best thing i have ever done

962988 the vikings according to the source remain convinced that the packers dont want favre on their roster in 2008
962989 sources have told foxsports com that efforts to trade favre will be ramped up once he shows up in wisconsin the same sources also said that once favre reports he will no longer have the right to veto any trade

962992 mr obama needs to hammer home conservative social values to capture undecided white voters he might lose jesse jacksons vote but he wont lose many black votes and he will win the undecided white votes he needs to become americas first african american president
962993 because within the time frame dr peppers daughter would only have been around 5 at the time morrison left
962994 dr charles t pepper also had a son louis or louie an optometrist who was also known as dr pepper
962995 he worked part time in his fathers drug store and also claimed to have developed the formula for the drink
962996 dr pepper is named after dr charles t pepper an 1855 graduate of the university of virginia medical school
962997 who practiced medicine at his pharmacy in rural retreat va in the late 1800s the entire history of dr pepper was published in 1995 by author jeffrey rodengen his book authorized by me is entitled
962998 what we found was that according to the us census morrison lived in the town of christiansburg va and worked as a pharmacy clerk
962999 in that same census on the next page if i remember correctly is another dr pepper and he has a daughter malinda or malissa who is only 16 to morrisons 17
963000 if you understand that the census takers walked from house to house you can tell they were near neighbors this makes much more sense to me than dr charles t pepper 40 miles away in rural retreat there is not one piece of evidence that morrison ever worked for dr charles t pepper in rural retreat va
963001 nowadays if youre not big business youre not in business
963002 rural retreat journal store closes and a way of life is just a memory
963003 i should be honored in being associated with you in any contemplated enterprise you would permit me to participate in viewing the probability of a rupture with spain i am disposed in the confidential spirit of this letter to offer you and my friends and my own services in any contemplated measures in which you may embark
963004 i went up to wise that night along with my cousin and not meaning no harm
963005 along in the evening raymond meade came along and said he would give me a lift back to my house in pound
963006 your bed covers is in pappys room but dont go in there hes drunk and hes going to run ma out of the house tomorrow
963007 jesus jesus why cant a man whip his own child
963008 and you wouldnt remember so good either if you had been as scared as i was that night with pappy a yellin and a cussin and edith a tryin to outrun him
963009 killing a ten foot hairy giant he called a yahoo
963010 boone was encamped with five other men on red river
963011 and they had with them for their amusement the history of samuel gullivers travels wherein he gave an account of his young master glumdelick careing sic him on a market day for a show to a town called lulbegrud
963012 in the party who amid such strange surroundings read and listened to swifts writings was a young man named alexander neely one night he came into camp with two indian scalps taken from a shawnee village he had found on a creek running into the river and he announced to the circle of grim wilderness veterans that he had been that day to lulbegrud and had killed two brobdignags in their capital to this day the creek by which the two luckless shawnees lost their lives is known as lulbegrud creek
963013 the natives are greatly terrified by the sight of a person in a mask calling him devil or yah hoo which signifies evil spirit
963014 they have an evil spirit which causes them great terror whom they call yahoo or devil devil he lives in the tops of the steepest and rockiest mountains which are totally inaccessible to all human beings and comes down at night to seize and run away with men women or children whom he eats up children being his favourite food the name of yahoo being used to express a bad spirit or bugaboo was common also with the aborigines of van diem e ns land tasmania
963015 so that while i am not one of the people about whom i write for there is the sharpest line drawn there between the townspeople and the true countrymen still my childhood and most of my life was spent amid such scenes as i have attempted to portray
963016 i get more and more out of it the further i go
963017 they are a taciturn people little given to demonstration making light alike of their sufferings and their pleasures but feeling with the full force of an ardent southern temperament all the time
963018 yes we have plenty of moonshiners and among them are some of the best people there
963019 a keen sense of humor is one of their chief characteristics it is the shrewd humor in these characters that make them so lovable a group of north georgians never comes together without this trait becoming apparent their conversations overflow with a canny mirth that is irresistible
963020 abner daniel is a type only a very common type in north georgia you can meet possible abner daniels sitting around on benches and cracker boxes all through this region i have listened to the conversation of such men by the hour
963021 crude whimsical sarcastic yet good natured droll witty human abner daniel stands quite apart and it unlikely that his creator will ever surpass this creation no one can read carefully any of his stories and fail to be impressed by their underlying sincerity or fail to rejoice in the crisp humor that seems to be as much a part of old abner and pole baker as the blue is of the sky
963022 i have attempted first to portray what is or was present in any geographic area and to reconstruct the pattern of original forest insofar as the fragments permit
963023 second to give data on composition and aspect of forest communities in all parts of the deciduous forest and third to trace through geologic time the development of the present pattern of forest distribution
963024 as the years go by it becomes increasingly difficult to form any concept of the original forest cover the virgin forests have been cut the land is either cleared and farmed or is clothed with second growth forest which may in no way suggest the original forest in many sections no single tract of virgin forest remains today
963025 as pessoas t m o seu tempo muito supostamente preenchido claro
963026 plaintiff met defendant in philadelphia while stationed there and defendant became seemingly and very sincerely in love or infatuated with plaintiff
963027 plaintiff was not in love with defendant to the extent of considering a marriage with defendant as defendant was of a foreign nativity to wit an italian but she was so persistent in her intercessions to induce plaintiff to marry her that plaintiff in a moment of weakness he consummated the contract and married her though sincerely and truthfully plaintiff was not in love with defendant but after he had married her he determined to treat her right and perhaps would learn to love her and brought her home to knoxville tn and after plaintiff brought her home to his mothers home where he had always lived with his mother sisters and bros
963028 soon after he brought her home she began to exhibit that defiant spirit as dictatorial as old man musselino himself she became a demon and devil incarnate and without any just excuse or case she made the life of not only the plaintiff but all the family a hell on earth and kept the entire family in a constant uproar all the time and never spoke a kind word all the time and she became so violent that she assaulted plaintiff every time he came into the home
963029 defendant believed in ruling by brute force and demonstrated her belief by often assaulting plaintiff without any just excuse or case
963030 on more occasions than one she threatened to poison him and on one occasion she threw a knife at him and stuck the knife in his leg and said she intended to kill him and said that if she did not get to poison him she would stab him through the heart when he was asleep
963031 plaintiff knew that she meant to kill him or do him some great bodily harm and was forced to leave home her conduct was so cruel and inhuman toward him that it is not safe to long cohabit with her and be under her dominion and control
963032 she shows plainly that she is an italian is possessed of a wicked and malignant heart and that she is fatally bent on mischief and is unforgiving like most of foreigners
963033 it is true that she and the plaintiff were married in north carolina in december 1924 and that they came to knoxville to live in february 1925 at which time the defendant came to the home of the plaintiffs parents where she lived until conditions became intolerable there
963034 at the time she came to the home of her mother in law she had been in norfolk va and at that time the plaintiff transferred from land duty to sea duty as a sailor in the navy and went to sea leaving the defendant in destitute circumstances and taking the last money from here that she had and left this defendant absolutely penniless
963035 this defendant is amused at the plaintiffs charges that he was not in love with her and that she was in love or infatuated with him and made violent love to him and inveigled or induced him in a moment of weakness to marry her these charges are absolutely false and untrue
963036 as a matter of fact this defendant at that time was but an eighteen year old girl and the plaintiff was a man six years older than herself and as he says in his bill a man schooled in the ways of the world having sailed the seven seas and well able to take care of himself being a man of average intelligence
963037 these charges in his bill are a reflection upon himself rather than upon this defendant but the defendant deems it proper to state the facts because said charges as well as all other charges in his bill are wicked and untrue
963038 she did go to norfolk va after he had transferred to that point from philadelphia but went at his insistence and request and at his expense he coming from norfolk to philadelphia to get her and took her back to norfolk with him
963039 plaintiff says he was never in love with this defendant if that is true he married her under the grossest misrepresentation because she was in love with him at that time her affections having been won by his persistent favors and attentions and promises and the only consideration of this marriage was that of what she deemed an honorable love

963065 i was 20 years old and like all young men of my age at the time i was interested in finding something that i could keep as a souvenir so went mooching around the school
963066 i eventually came across a banner with the school name written on it but what was more interesting was the fact that the backing to the banner was made of green baise
963067 our cap badge at this time was a small welsh dragon which required a small piece of green baise behind it so finding this banner was quite lucky for me and two of my friends
963068 i was absolutely over the moon with the invitation especially when they said they would pay for everything
963069 it will be wonderful to go back it has been a few years since i was there and i expect it was changed a lot
963070 the banner has been to italy egypt palestine back to two places in germany but never back to the town and school from where i nicked it
963071 we had a dairy barn and a sheep barn we used to raise lambs and we had a big chicken house and we had chickens rhode island reds we raised baby chicks and we had baby pigs and all of that out from the house you didnt want them too close
963072 the government had to have everything government inspected before you could sell it the eggs had to be candled and the meat had to be government inspected and you couldnt sell them its changed so much you have to be a big farmer to make a living because a little farmer cant hardly make a living
963073 prohibition in the south is a failure not only because it does not prohibit but because it is breeding a defiance of law and has set up in the place of licensed saloons illegal dispensers of liquor
963074 not only has prohibition as a general rule failed to improve conditions that existed under the local option system but it has wiped out the reforms accomplished under the latter plan and has nullified the good effects of regulation wherever it existed
963075 both houses of the legislature within a few hours after gov henderson had vetoed the bills and asked that the prohibition question be submitted to voters at a special election voted on his proposal and repassed the bills by overwhelming majorities
963076 the prohibition measures re enact the prohibition law repealed in 1911 after it had been in force two years under the 1911 local option law all but eight of the sixty seven counties have voted dry

963131 the pakistani commando division trained by the united states is an elite special operations force similar to the u s armys special forces or green berets
963132 the pakistan government wants to show that we want to bring terror in our region to an end and that we want to work with the united states for that purpose
963133 but we also believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
963134 they have agreed to take certain measures but it would not be appropriate to make them public so that results could be achieved but we are discussing and have agreed to take certain actions to strengthen relations between the two countries and to fight the war against terrorism more successfully so our mutual objectives could be achieved

963440 jobs dropped by another 51 000 in manufacturing construction retailing and temporary employment adding to a string of losses that totaled 463 000 since january

963442 weak economy coincides with a sharp increase in labor productivity in the second quarter which helps to explain why employers have been shedding workers

963447 recessions dont usually look like this at least when it comes to productivity
963448 even amid economic weakness productivity is estimated to have grown an average 2 5 percent at an annual rate
963449 productivitys usual behavior of going up in good times and down in bad times
963450 some economists say the current healthy growth in productivity reflects a shift in the economy from less productive domestic sectors like home building and into exporting industries which tend to be highly efficient
963451 who would have thought id play a spicoli like character and then make out with spicoli in the same year
963452 it couldnt be a better showcase for his talent to look at these two roles theyre both different sides of him
963453 he can bring the attributes of the young stoner guy he needs for pineapple but underneath that is the scholar and the deep thinker and the guy who wants to learn about art and is interested in politics his performances are complex and layered
963454 a very smart sweet person he seems to have really evolved over the last 10 years into this really easygoing approachable warm man when we did freaks and geeks he was so hungry and obsessed with the work it made him a little more of an intense guy now hes very happy in his life
963455 we sent him pineapple for the role of dale the idea came up to switch roles
963456 so lovable in the movie and we didnt predict that the lovability of franco would come through so much saul was written as the dumbest guy on earth no ones sitting there thinking james franco should play him sometimes it takes working with your friends to bring that up and believe it would work

963458 they wanted me to wear these guatemalan pants i was like who wears these awful things and judd and shauna robertson the other producer are good friends with woody harrelson and said woody wears these all the time i even met some other friends of woodys and theyre like yeah woody wears them thats how the outfit came about
963459 i was always going to play saul they found me in my apartment there was no script they just came into my place my dealer came after me it was perfect
963460 i used to smoke weed but i havent done it in a long time everybody even now thinks that guy is stoned its just the way i talk because i dont smoke weed somehow theres something about me the way i talk that implies that im on drugs
963461 we got them leashes so we could take them outside because theyre completely indoor cats they got so scared

963463 we used to laugh because in between takes hed be reading the iliad on set we still havent read the iliad it was a very difficult book with him it was always james joyce or something
963464 this sounds so pretentious but i was reading proust and judd is like why do you read things like that i dont know its good but judd reads he gave me a great book called a fans notes by a guy named frederick exley
963465 theres a sensitivity that exudes from him he can without trying make you see into his soul he makes it seem effortless
963466 what do you think about me being the other girl
963467 and he would always ask me if my girlfriend was the better kisser
963468 a minute it doesnt sound like a long time but in front of 200 people its a long time

963480 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
963481 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
963482 its part of the reason we all like celebrities we can always be less of an idiot than these people
963483 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
963484 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine and i view it as the latter
963485 its embarrassing it puts people in a position where everyone who works with them in the future will expect a lot of money
963486 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
963487 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
963488 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
963489 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
963490 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
963491 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story

963497 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices its the holy grail for the future of communications
963498 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
963499 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
963500 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before

963523 the young typist the two of them often stood whispering in the corner
963524 i got on better with anne than with margot who was more attached to her mother the reason for that may have been that margot rarely showed her feelings and didnt need as much support because she didnt suffer from mood swings as much as anne did

963531 one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that i have ever read
963532 of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss no voice is more compelling than that of anne frank

963534 awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young
963535 because these beliefs are patently false and because they were and will always be challenged by the likes of anne frank they are bound to fail

963540 the reason for her immortality was basically literary she was an extraordinarily good writer for any age and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition
963541 i have to say that we are very sad for felipe
963542 because in my view he drove the best race of his career today it was fantastic the way that he attacked when he had to attack and he managed the race right up to the final laps so we are very disappointed

963611 in race two i got hit by tom sykes on lap one going into druids
963612 his bike caught my brake lever and that locked up the front end and i was forced to go straight into the gravel where i crashed
963613 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
963614 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
963615 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
963616 its taken me a bit of time to adjust to the mygale because its very different to the cars ive driven before but im learning all the time and things are starting to get better and better
963617 i really enjoyed the race obviously there was a lot of work to do after the problem in qualifying but we had a very good run
963618 i think im now driving better than i ever have done before it was a little bit frustrating to be able to lap at the same speed as the front group but not be able to close on them but from 18th on the grid it was a good finish
963619 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
963620 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
963621 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
963622 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
963623 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
963624 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
963625 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
963626 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
963627 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
963628 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
963629 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
963630 polow da don did the beat thats all ill say polow did the beat i aint saying whos featured on it or nothing like that im just saying when it comes out we aint doing no leaks we aint doing nothing when it comes out straight video straight radio all in the same day
963631 im from south atlanta shawty lo from west atlanta gucci mane is from east atlanta and basically you know its swagger its all about your swag dudes going louis dudes going gucci dudes going prada so i was like let me go gucci real quick we hooked up went into the studio knocked the song out and basically its like three 12 bar verses we just spittin about how swagged out we are basically just a swag record i went in i did the beat
963632 that was gonna be my first single leading into my second album
963633 it was a hot record three million views on youtube two million plays all that but i didnt wanna go back that route no more like i was already successful with a big dance song this record was incorporated with a dance it was another big dance and it was about to take over again i told the record company i was like stop i dont wanna come back dancing cause the question that everybodys asking is like what am i gonna come back with so i could have took back over with that record but i think dancing is starting to get a little corny so i was like man im gonna hold off on that tip so i just threw it on the mixtape its heavy in the streets we gonna shoot an underground video to it
963634 basically the record is just talking about the fact that im successful in the industry so i got a lot of cheese
963635 i made 6 mil at 16 so basically im just saying im on a shopping spree just talking cash money thats all
963636 i went to barack obamas office right before he started running for president
963637 so you know we went in and talked and everything people were wondering what we talked about it was confidential but i was a firm supporter of barack even before he decided to run for the presidency so im all for it man were making history and were still going strong so make sure you vote obama believe that 08
963638 its great i want it back i want the records back
963639 he has the music its right there in the computer
963640 i stop by his studio every time and get something that adds something significant to my project each time im about to put a record out and i spend three or four days there to me hes the best producer in the game
963641 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
963642 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
963643 im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out
963644 when we came out i can say it now i actually hated puff daddy
963645 i can say that now cause puff is my man i was disgusted at what they was doing with the shiny suits and the blow up dolls and looking like missy i didnt agree with that i felt the shiny suit movement was destroying the grimy movement as i got older i learned to respect people for doing different things at that time pone was actually locked up i was on the streets and i would turn on bet and mtv it would be the shiny suit dudes it was a messed up time mase was killing them
963646 yall can say what yall wanna say about mase but he was killin them you almost wanted to throw on something shiny they caught remember jay with the sunshine video he had the ferris wheel the cyclone whatever it was real hard
963647 first time its just mobb deep and cnn capone n noreaga
963648 we got prodigy we got him in jail on the phone call we got him before jail after jail thats it we dont know the name of it
963649 we letting them know we relevant we survived the storm
963650 nothings changed we always gonna be relevant as long as good music is relevant
963651 people think capone and nore we havent lived in the hood for the past 12 years so they think we may be in hollywood or la la land the record is basically nore telling me i never should have went there but i had to do it hollywood is not hollywood as you know it though
963652 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
963653 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
963654 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
963655 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
963656 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
963657 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
963658 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
963659 ultimately the concept of the video deals with humanity and the relationships between human beings and how your basic sense of humanity can override any sort of politicized situation
963660 its about being compassionate and humanistic in that sort of situation so you could call it a microcosm of whats happening in the world today
963661 viele in moskau und tiflis trauern heute den vers umten m glichkeiten f r eine l sung des problems nach

963666 heres a special thank you gift for participating in our caption this contest
963667 they should have acquitted me because of course i didnt swear at anybody
963668 five days isnt bad i thought id get 10 or even 15 the officer who arrested me was in court but he didnt even look at me even when the judge asked him to maybe he felt ashamed
963669 its not against the law to carry a flag what is wrong with wanting to be part of europe
963670 my daughter is very well brought up and those cops lied about her swearing to get her into trouble what a disgrace for our police
963671 most of our police dont want to fight crime or take on the bandits they prefer to spend their time repressing young people and stopping them from going on demonstrations
963672 most belarussians think of russia as a kind older brother who will always help us
963673 but russia is an enemy that wants to swallow us and take away belarus independence
963674 but someone has to do something if not us then who the absolute majority is unhappy but most people just complain in their kitchens they are afraid to act
963675 but its terrible for belarus this country has lost some of the brightest most creative young people who knows how many will come back
963676 you can leave the country for three months come back and find that nothing has changed and for me that is awful
963677 i dont want to spend all my life in a regime of total fear of total control of unpredictable arrests when a policeman can stop you and beat you for no reason
963678 i think one day people here will understand that this system is finished
963679 i am sure that this day will come and the army will join the peoples side and they will join us it will not happen tomorrow but we should prepare for it
963680 this type of behaviour is a crucial part of emo ideology
963681 of course there are emo teens who just listen to their music but our actions are not directed at them but rather at those who also hurt themselves commit suicide and promote those acts
963682 suicide is not a symptom of emo culture i work with other teens too and every group has emotionally troubled kids
963683 ill be voting from london but you can vote from anywhere if you live abroad youve got to do it every single vote will count
963684 we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
963685 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with producer stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar
963686 weve hidden ourselves away in the depths of the english countryside recorded a new track in london at the last possible moment and now were in los angeles tying up the loose ends
963687 millonarios solo jug al pelotazo y la equidad al toque
963688 just as racketeers in kenya and tanzania are joining forces to ensure smooth operations in their criminal undertakings authorities have no choice other than striking same mutual cooperation in wiping out cross border crime
963689 the somali bandits are no longer a threat our main worry now is the number of local people carrying the military guns in the area
963690 but we cannot rule out the use of such weapons for cattle rustling and banditry
963691 to protect themselves their families and properties landlords in lagos through community development association cda had no choice but to resort to the erection of street gates
963692 they restrict the number of passable roads in the metropolis and commercial drivers are left with very few routes to ply they worsen the traffic situation by increasing the number of vehicles on the open roads
963693 since residents started erecting the gates has the incidence of armed robbery reduced
963694 since they know most streets have gates which are locked at night they themselves no longer operate late at night
963695 can we now say with these gates on their streets armed robbers no more invade our neighbourhood
963696 left for me i would say let them dismantle these gates
963697 in a foreseeable future with the level of influx of people into lagos and high level of unemployment government may not be able to provide the much needed security
963698 a necessary inconvenience in view of the fact that we place security of life above any such temporary inconvenience i believe that to a large extent the erection of gates has helped in limiting operations of the men of the underworld
963699 late last year a group of about eight armed robbers invaded our street they forced the street gate open and raided the residents from house to house sparing no house our security men could not be found throughout the time the robbers were operating the robbers carted away goods and cash this was around 10 30pm on saturday the street gate has no meaning to me from that experience
963700 its still very much melody based but its different too in ways from the other albums
963701 its hard to know what everyone will make of it but were happy id go as far as to say i think its our best album yet
963702 the new album should be out some time later this year maybe october and we certainly want to get home to play a big gig for everyone next year
963703 its a little bit of alternative a little bit of pop a little bit of rock
963704 i basically stepped outside of my comfort zone and i came up with something that i can honestly say is for everyone
963705 this album is about diversity i think that one of the emphases will be that a gentleman is diverse
963706 after i refused to give her the nrcs she then told me that it was tradition for the ministry to give land to a minister when it was allocating land but i still refused to give her any cards
963707 i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first its to work hard to win a championship year after year and second to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community
963708 he came to me one day and said it means a lot to me if you could answer this question do you believe that ive told the truth i told him i believe you donaghy told us the truth
963709 we felt it was very important he came with us
963710 but hopefully the lads will help him get over it
963711 everybody has his own way of looking at things but i think local coaches are ready for the job
963712 i thought i had worked well enough under foreign coaches and therefore had to be given the chance to prove myself
963713 i did the job with all my heart the outcome clearly showed that i had something in me
963714 we are thinking it will be in the interest of the club to finish with our hostel project first and then two look at our pitch we are thinking of astro turf before playing in africa
963715 our decision not to play is not financial yes financial is there but you also have to look at the priorities but looking at our resources it will not be possible
963716 we shall also reach out to other multinational companies and public spirited individuals for sponsors as we are trying to identify other areas of the clubs function that need support
963717 as the sole sponsor of the clubs outing and activities for some time now
963718 endeavour to institutionalise standard accounting procedures in handling of financial matters of the club
963719 we shall exhibit a very high degree of probity by rendering periodic statement of account at an interval to be decided upon by the central working committee cwc of the club an intention borne out of our firm belief in the process of wide consultation before actions are taken even as we have put down some action steps that are sufficiently potent to take the club to the next level
963720 there shall be a slight modification in the composition frequency and place of executive and general meetings
963721 the roads and the streets need to be fixed but the roads like i 279 shouldnt
963722 it never really looks bad to me to tell you the truth it really doesnt but there area a lot of wrecks here
963723 im not worried i just take my time and go
963724 at this point in time i can say that my team cannot win the national title even if we won and dr ashraf ahmed finishes second or third he is champion
963725 the madagascar players have improved a lot over the past year and it was not surprising to see them match our play and captialise on our mistakes we put in a lot of time and resources into this game and im happy weve pulled it off
963726 felix is a strong lad even when they pulled at him he kept running he died for his country he is one for the future and hopefully he will be okay for the return leg of the elgon cup due in a fortnight
963727 we know there are a lot of things we still have to improve on but this was a big positive for us and we will try to build on it i am very pleased that the players remained calm after province scored late in the game and the way in which we dominated the breakdowns
963728 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
963729 and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mud slingers
963730 not because it asked the question is barack obama ready for the job thats a very legitimate criticism and i think barack obama made it a little bit worse by his stumbling response later the problem is that mccain mccains strategy has to hinge in my view on one thing how does a republican survive in october and november a huge anti republican vote luckily for the party mccain is a different kind of republican so everything in the campaign ought to build toward that case and when if you get off into the small juvenile stuff about britney spears i think you distract from that
963731 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
963732 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on

963736 i think it will be very sad if they dont have enough users to maintain the critical mass because we need more successful mmos in the world not more failures
963737 whether theyve hit the right rhythm longevity gameplay and style depends on the vagaries of the market i know they worked really really hard on it and i know they tried really really hard on it and if they dont make it thats a real shame because thats peoples mortgages

963751 for all the speculation about whether humphrey the cat the former no 10 cat is going to be the next leadership contender and that was taking up acres of pages the no 10 agenda was on the economy
963752 the really big striking contrast between working at no 10 and government departments is the extent to which the economy dominates whether it is gas prices mortgage starts the insolvencies the edf takeover of british energy all the economic news that is about peoples standard of living and prospects for the future
963753 we have to make sure that everything is put in place as much as possible to make sure they are fully protected
963754 it was also very timely for me to be there at the 10th anniversary of the national minimum wages since i helped to invent the low pay commission when i was in opposition as a shadow employment secretary

963760 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
963761 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country

963773 the crazy thing is that my minds made up so let the music play
963774 its been a good tour but the one disappointment is that i dont have some more people here with me
963775 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
963776 its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc

963908 the limits to future petroleum supplies have more to do with politics than with geology and resource availability for example the most promising acreage remaining in the u s is located offshore most of which is off limits to the industry

963910 this idea of being covered in the dust of your rabbi came from something everybody had seen a rabbi would come to town and right behind him would be this group of students doing their best to keep up with the rabbi as he went about teaching his yoke from one place to another by the end of a day of walking in the dirt directly behind their rabbi the students would have the dust from his feet all over them and that was a good thing

963941 the buff breasted sandpiper has definitely caused much excitement over the last 24 hours the twitch sighting this morning was an amazing experience especially as the local birdlife free state members present welcomed three experienced birders who travelled through the night from pietermaritzburg to join us this morning leaving soon after receiving an sms that the bird had been found again yesterday evening the valentines senior also drove down from gauteng arriving at krugersdrift dam just after 07h30 this morning
963942 the buff breasted sandpiper was showing well again this morning sunday and was probably the cause of the biggest twitch the free state has ever seen i have been told that there were upwards of 40 people there this morning

963947 im happy to have scored a goal against a great club like barcelona and i need to just keep working my job as a forward is to score goals and i did so i just need to keep working

963951 i cant be more pleased with jeremy zuttah he said
963952 im getting that experience and hopefully it puts me in great position to make plays out there
963953 it feels natural again im getting used to the speed and being out there with the best of the best is something i really take pride in when ray lewis tells you good job it really inspires me
963954 i was impressed with the way he came through that
963955 he learned how to pick up blitzes he was dog tired and he stepped in the a gap and hit linebackers in the face thats not easy to do
963956 carry the ball when youre really really fatigued and hold onto the ball and protect the ball when youre fatigued catch the ball run a nice route hes done a nice job
963957 taking everybodys reps hes a lot sharper now and understands the plays better
963958 the amount of snaps he has taken has kind of put him in a comfort zone as a running back thats what you want
963959 now the game slows down and its not at such a fast pace whereas before he was in a panic mode now hes out of the straitjacket and we can put him in a wheelchair and push him around a little bit he sees everything opening up now
963960 you want to get your pad level down and get the ball in there tight with your head gear down so you have something of a triangle
963961 now ray is an upright runner so we are constantly working on him to drop his pads and lower himself so he can protect the ball
963962 the hits do feel different im not going to lie
963963 you cant always fight against it youve got to know when to go down sometimes if you cant get extra yards thats when you have to be careful
963964 you can see a big difference in how he has grown at catching the football from the minicamps to this camp ray wasnt a receiver in college and has still got a long way to go but is really improving well
963965 he has a passion and love for his fellow man he cares about people

964041 a murdoch character means what he says when he announces that to be looked at by his beloved is like being seen by god that love will redeem his sufferings annihilate the obscure guilty confusion of his finite chance harried being sublate his will into a necessity that governs accident and ordains significance his old self will fall away together with the vexation of innumerable wearying claims on his attention by contingent beings whom love has not so justified and he will be saved perhaps even deified all shall be well and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well

964091 sir my husband is just going for a rabbit snack because he didnt get enough to eat at the dinner theatre i swear you can even test that blood dripping from his jaw
964092 and rebecca honey would you please share with the class what your mommy does for a living
964093 oh my mommy turns into a lion at night and goes after deers sometimes though shes not good at gettin all the blood off her paws daddy sometimes has to lick it for her then they both flop over on their sides with their bellies full of deer meat beaver meat and that mean ol mr damario whos always plaining about the smell comin from the shed i bet he wont plain no more
964094 oh okay um michele honey youre uh youre next i think and rebecca sweetie dont go anywhere okay we should really talk to principal devoti after school maybe share this story with the school counselor mr st giles while were at it
964095 uh uh my mommy told me not to tell nobody i only shared this with you cause you asked us to mommy and daddy said nothing bout sharin it if i told you mommy and daddy might put you next to the rest of mr damario that would make me sad
964096 going up given the shift from buying to letting and we are seeing rents reflect this
964097 were just starting to talk about it but i think well do it this season
964098 an episode where the boys investigate a haunting at one of the high schools they used to go to and then flashback to what the boys high school lives were like well sort of see them played by 18 year olds and giving people swirlies or whatever the hell they did i dont know yet we havent worked it out
964099 were not really going to see hell except in quick flashes and those types of moments
964100 there isnt going to be like fade in hell dean being poked with a pitchfork its going to be more about his return to earth and what that does to you psychologically hes still dean but deep in his soul hes been in the worst pow camp ever
964101 the boys have never been able to keep secrets from each other before not since season one when they were separate so to have a period of time where they were separate and they can surprise each other again has been really refreshing and fun to write
964102 i think sam and dean are both more individual or at least more heady
964103 theyve both done things in the last four months that theyre kind of worried about i think as we get into the meat of the season between episodes eight and fifteen were really going to delve into what sam did for those four months while dean was gone and the pain that hes gone through his brother was dead he buried his brother and then had to deal with it for a couple months and deal with it however you know he probably did some things he wasnt necessarily sure about and proud of hes definitely more hard edged
964104 for the first time theres a lot of story mythology centered around dean
964105 a lot of it was about sam and being psychic and whatever and now theres mysteries about each of them
964106 i always figured dean would come back otherwise its the sam winchester show
964107 i didnt know how and i didnt know why i always figured it would be that they find a way to get me out and that i would go back to just being dean and trying to save sam from whatever the demons had in store for him but now that ive come back and i cant figure out why or how its really starting to play into the psyche of dean and what hes going to go through and how thats going to involve himself into the mythology of not just sam but the entire show
964108 ill be the first to say when certain episodes or certain seasons suck but im really excited about this one
964109 were giggling like schoolgirls in the writers room we think were on to something this year i think we have some really really cool stuff in store
964110 penso che il 1984 sia stato lanno in cui il punk nella sua espressione pi incisiva sia finito
964111 era tutto cos nuovo e mi sono accorto che non ero semplicemente un fan ma mi sentivo coinvolto meglio una buona idea abbozzata piuttosto che con una pienamente realizzata
964112 prendete un giornale prendete le forbici scegliete nel giornale un articolo della lunghezza che desiderate per la vostra poesia ritagliate larticolo ritagliate poi accuratamente ognuna delle parole che compongono larticolo e mettetele in un sacco agitate delicatamente tirate poi fuori un ritaglio dopo laltro disponendoli nellordine in cui sono usciti dal sacco copiate scrupolosamente la poesia vi somiglier ed eccovi divenuto uno scrittore infinitamente originale e di squisita sensibilit bench incompresa dal volgo

964115 ragazzi io lho vissuto quel periodo a met degli anni 70 vivevo a londra ho vissuto la nascita del movimento quel punk il punk 77 per intenderci finito
964116 se mi guardo in giro penso che il punk non esiste pi con tutte quelle sceme della mia et che vanno per negozi comprano roba firmata e si spacciano per punk ma io ci credo ancora il punk vive dentro me e finch ci sar anche solo una persona che vive per il punk che la musica per il messaggio di ribellione allora il punk sar vivo ribellatevi perch io ci voglio credere ancora
964117 mettiamola cos il punk non vivo e nemmeno morto esiste e basta e non potr mai smettere di esistere finch qualcuno ci creder almeno che il mondo non venga invaso da gente superficiale ma ricordatevi che il punk non unetichetta il punk essere
964118 chi pensa che i green day i blink 182 o i sum 41 facciano punk non ha capito niente
964119 ognuno pu suonare quello che gli pare sia chiaro noi rispettiamo tutti per ricordiamoci che il punk nasce nei garage non nelle grandi case discografiche che cercano soltanto il profitto noi e come noi un sacco di giovani gruppi ci autoproduciamo e siamo liberi di suonare quello che vogliamo punk e pop nascono e vivono con logiche completamente opposte
964120 finley avril lavigne e tokio hotel quello non punk lo volete capire quelli fanno soldi a palate alla faccia vostra e vi prendono in giro
964121 il punk disordine protesta suonare nei garage tutto fuorch la perfezione musicale e i suoi puliti di gruppi come i blink o i good charlotte come fanno pop e punk ad unirsi e impossibile e poi il punk uno stile di vita non la moda del momento
964122 spille borchie creste o tagli corti asimmetrici anfibi spille da balia usate come orecchini catene al collo con un lucchetto per chiudere le estremit giubbotti personalizzati jeans attillati e spesso strappati o usurati e sarai perfetta
964123 fatti furba se segui il punk come fosse una moda vuol dire che non hai capito niente se uno punk lo vedi da come si comporta e non da come si veste
964124 che senso ha dirsi punk e poi vestirsi seguendo la moda del momento
964125 vanno di moda i braccialetti con le borchie tutti che se li comprano va di moda la scarpa di una certa marca tutti a comprarsele questo soprattutto tra le ragazze ma dico se sei punk devi sentirti ed essere anticonformista non correre dietro alla massa
964126 trovo proprio ridicola questa storia che bisogna vestirsi a seconda della musica che si ascolta forse perch io ascolto un po di tutto e dovrei cambiarmi tre volte al giorno scherzi a parte ma non un modo come un altro per creare la diversit anche dove non ci dovrebbe essere
964127 non ci piace stare in posti dove non siamo accettati o dove ci guardano male solo per come siamo vestiti
964128 noi quei posti li evitiamo ci piace stare solo dove possiamo essere noi stessi senza venire giudicati dallapparenza su internet tutto pi facile anche perch le tecnologie sono semplici da utilizzare e possiamo crearci noi degli spazi dove vivere come ci pare il nostro stile e sfogare tutta la nostra attitudine e la voglia dessere quello che siamo
964129 la via italiana al punk passata anche attraverso il demenziale non sono la stessa cosa ma il demenziale contiene una parte delle radici punk e della sua ribellione
964130 quando gli skiantos hanno cominciato a suonare non avevano informazioni su quello che oggi chiamiamo punk rock non ne sapevamo nulla suonavamo per insofferenza al rock melenso alla musica dance e cantautori in mezzo a queste cose ci siamo ritagliati il nostro spazio disprezzavamo dance e cantautori in quanto portatori sani di tedio musicale e contenutistico specialmente i secondi pretendevano di essere poeti ma poi trovavi solo una gran pochezza
964131 la musica di sorella maldestra arrivata in mezzo a una serie di momenti ludici a scuola quando andavi al cesso invece di fare quello che si fa ora ci portavamo il cestino della carta che diventava un rullante e una chitarrina di plastica un giocattolo con le corde di nylon tutte uguali si sapeva che cera il punk ma il coagulo di tutto laspetto sonoro fu il blues pi ruspante fatto in italiano che come musica di protesta funzionava benissimo era dissenso verso la cultura musicale di massa i testi dovevano essere banali per funzionare su accordi banali ma andavano bene per esprimere un senso di rifiuto
964132 quella che oggi viene definita la via italiana al punk rock ovvero il genere demenziale ha avuto dalla sua parte lironia che derivava dal movimento studentesco bolognese del 77 lironia ti fa prendere le distanze dal piercing ante litteram vissuto come tortura punk era esibire un disagio vissuto sulla pelle letteralmente in modo da mettere in imbarazzo i piccoli borghesi che guardavano dalla finestra senza arroganza ma ci sembrava di avere unarma in pi nel sarcasmo il movimento studentesco scopriva lironia come liberazione politica dallideologia obbligatoria fu una boccata daria permise di scardinare questa eccessiva seriosit che era lo stesso motivo per il quale non ci piacevano i cantautori era il nostro valore aggiunto
964133 sapevamo che le cantine di bologna pullulavano di gruppi come quelle di roma di firenze e di pordenone soprattutto qui ci andavano gi pi decisi ci sentivamo pi affini a loro
964134 ci concentrammo sulle affinit che cerano con il punk pi che sulle differenze
964135 condividemmo larea di rivoluzione che il punk portava con s e ci siamo sentiti quindi accomunati ad esso nel condividere una certa rabbia un certo senso di impotenza
964136 c stato un grosso colpo di scena ovvero che gli skiantos si sono fermati nel 1981 proprio perch in qualche modo non pronti e consoni al successo ci toccava scegliere se diventare le stupide rockstar che contestavamo oppure se considerare conclusa la nostra storia artistica il gruppo si spezz perch ci fu proposto di andare al xxx festival di sanremo i duri e puri tra i quali il sottoscritto sostenevano linutilit di andarci non si potevano cambiare la societ e la sua struttura con una canzone i possibilisti che col senno di poi avevano ragione sostenevano che finch fossimo rimasti fedeli alla nostra idea di arte e performance saremmo potuti andare ovunque vinsero gli oltranzisti duri e puri e gli skiantos si fermarono correvamo il rischio di entrare nella classifica di tutta la musica che detestavano ci riprendemmo nell84 e fu un percorso tutto in salita per recuperare il terreno perduto il disco successivo che conteneva canzone per lestate nda fu il disco di transizione dal barricadero verso un gruppo possibilista che si confrontava con il professionismo volendo rimanere fedele allidea demenziale della prima ora
964137 a distanza di anni un po ci sorprende lidea di aver sentito la voglia di riesumare il cadavere il titolo del nostro unico demotape ma stavamo riprovando la stessa sensazione di rifiuto per quel che ci circonda
964138 ti incazzi quando passa una mezza vita e ti accorgi che cambiato veramente poco ora stiamo lavorando anche via internet abbiamo un chitarrista a salerno e un tastierista a bruxelles finora abbiamo fatto tre concerti e scritto una dozzina di pezzi nuovi reclutando anche gente pi giovane per suonare che magari veniva ai nostri concerti allinizio vogliamo solo suonare dal vivo non cerchiamo una documentazione discografica di questa nuova fase
964139 come sorella maldestra non abbiamo mai suonato al rock a boom perch preferivamo situazioni meno classiche come scuole o palestre era per un punto di contatto molto importante una necessit per una zona dove come dicevo prima la spinta dei movimenti studenteschi arrivava solo come eco lontana al rock a boom ci suonai poi coi taken mentre mio fratello coi nemici delligiene ci praticamente cresciuto l dentro

964181 if obama picks nunn as his running mate it will cause widespread disillusionment with gay democrats and independents it is crucial to remember that supporters are more pro obama than anti mccain choosing nunn diminishes this palpable excitement and looks like politics as usual opening a door for mccain to increase his share of the glbt vote if obama picks nunn while at the same time mccain picks a moderate vp candidate i estimate that the gay vote for mccain will hover between 35 40 it is key that obama avoid falling into this trap if mccain picks a huckabee romney type however it would neutralize this advantage
964182 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
964183 ive loved and been loved all the rest is background music
964184 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
964185 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy
964186 who knows he probably had the stuff stashed somewhere i guess
964187 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge

964190 we have been waiting for a spark in the east washington corridor for a couple of years now
964191 this could be the small spark that ignites economic development in that corridor
964192 its modest but the prospect for explosive growth is very good here
964193 we will spend whatever it takes to make it a high quality facility
964194 hopefully it can jump start some other activities in the area
964195 you want to make it as easy to help as possible
964196 the whole piece on whether or not nonprofits can sell through the mail is not being fairly applied
964197 it is a violation of federal law to send raffle tickets stubs advertising or monies for same via the u s mail
964198 he was pretty unique as far as bringing a lot of stuff with him
964199 not only has your sense of self and ability to control your own body been taken away from you by someone elses action
964200 theres also losing that sense of having a safe place to go somewhere to shut the door and be secure which is what home means to us
964201 he was very careful it was obvious he didnt want to leave anything behind its just really difficult these stranger assaults
964202 what we want to encourage in people is really to try to exercise safe behavior
964203 we are so much taught that somehow the street is the dangerous place that if you carry your keys in your hand or have your pepper spray you can be safe
964204 but what are you supposed to do when youre sleeping in your own bed
964205 it was the exact same mo method of operation in both cases
964206 what they do is once it works the first time theyre going to do it the next time the same way i cant remember the last time somebody kicked in the door prior to an assault so thats pretty obvious
964207 obviously its not going to be a one time thing
964208 you dont get to pick the time you want to spend on each case
964209 i didnt want to be lost on my first day of high school
964210 the biggest thing is it really helps reduce the students anxiety on the first day
964211 we try to encourage them to break out of their shell
964212 its a nice way to get back to school and get an idea of whos coming in
964213 if i can get paid to do that then im in
964214 i was thinking about stuff you could send snacks clams oysters stuff like that
964215 cancer is not only a research and health issue it is a policy issue
964216 we have to join our neighbors illinois and minnesota in making wisconsin a smoke free state
964217 hopefully if i need it all this research will benefit me someday
964218 from that conversation there will be information that i will use to make a decision on how we move forward with the quarterback decision
964219 ill talk to everybody here tomorrow night and ill let you know the direction that were going as of now there has been no decision made its important for brett and i to sit down face to face and have that discussion tomorrow
964220 it would have to be one hell of a deal for them to trade favre to the minnesota vikings
964221 this was not planned but once again you have to have a plan that has the ability to adjust were doing that
964222 im not up here trying to win a popularity contest every decision we will make will be in the best interest of our football team
964223 im going to give it my best shot right now they say im the starter if theyre going to open it up to competition then i get a chance to compete and im going to do the best i can and let coach make the decision
964224 im a competitor im going to compete this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself
964225 i think we get back to the same thing that weve said over and over and over again since bretts retirement and then subsequent things that happened during the spring
964226 we decided to move forward at the quarterback position weve tried to do that
964227 things are a little different than they were back in february and early march but well see
964228 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
964229 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
964230 no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
964231 commissioner goodell will reinstate brett favre to the green bay packers active roster effective at noon on monday august 4

964234 you get some of your most enthusiast customers who would be more than willing to pay more money to tivo but they no longer have to and what weve basically done is for the cost of lifetime substituted that with a three year deal
964235 look at this system do you really think hed spend this much money to be satisfied with only half of the tivo
964236 a user in the tivo community forum stated that upon contacting time warner the company said that you cannot use a tivo with time warner cable

964250 rainer schuettler is declared entitled to participate in the mens single tennis tournament of the olympic games in beijing
964251 the cas panel found that rainer schuettler was among the top players eligible for the olympic tournament according to the itf criteria set up in their rules and that there was a discretion in the german noc to enter the players of its choice from amongst such eligible players
964252 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion
964253 while recognising that the german noc may not understand how professional tennis works there is no excuse for mr
964254 thats hitting below the belt you dont do that in sport
964255 oh theres an update i guess you didnt get it
964256 we are bound by the decisions of cas but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players i would say let them play
964257 the clubs should then say we were right to appeal to cas but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play
964258 in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23
964259 also when the tournament was opened to include three over aged players it remained without problems
964260 the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams it does not mention youth tournaments
964261 in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognises it is an internal problem which they need to solve themselves the olympic body will allow just one team britain
964262 we are the only federation that has 28 teams participating
964263 in 1932 football was banned because of an issue of professionalism
964264 there will be no more meetings wait until the new government is formed
964265 he told us once kuwait was invaded by iraq but now it has an embassy in iraq
964266 kuwait wants to solve problems by peaceful means not fighting

964305 there is a need to expand treatment to those who do not yet have treatment
964306 these people are uncared for because of the terrain of the country and there are not enough resources to provide services
964307 you need healthcare workers to administer the drugs without healthcare workers drugs are useless
964308 average life expectancy in malawi has fallen from 62 to 39 mainly due to aids with fewer staff it also means that people with other diseases are also not being taken care of

964310 unite the union is asking hsbc to think again 91 of members voting in our poll said they wanted to be balloted for strike action these proposals are out of all proportion and will cause real hardship to our many low paid members during their employment let alone when it comes to an end hsbc has made massive profits over the years the pension fund has been built up with the hard work of our members over many decades and the cost to the bank of keeping it going at the current rate is a drop in the ocean for hsbc especially in light of the strong half year results for the uk we are asking the bank to back off from these plans for the scheme in forthcoming negotiations with unite that way the tragic drop in morale the bank has seen in the many thousands of emails it has received as well as the very real threat of industrial action can be avoided
964311 we have very effective treatments for cancer in adolescents but they only work if the patient takes them
964312 this study shows that a strategically designed video game can be a powerful new tool to enhance the impact of medical treatment by motivating healthy behavior in the patient
964313 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
964314 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient

964337 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
964338 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
964339 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value

964371 m nasir combines elements of traditional and pop music to create contemporary melodies he makes wonderful music for modern listeners while promoting an interest in traditional music and arts
964372 for a long time traditional music had been relegated to kampung people modern urban listeners were enamoured with western contemporary songs rather than local music much less traditional tunes i needed to change that mindset
964373 at the time i was thinking about identity and our roots what is our identity as a race as a nation where are we heading as a race as a culture what is the direction of our arts and heritage all of these things were on my mind
964374 i have gone past the allure of glamour or wanting to be big i wanted to make something closer to my heart
964375 traditional music is like a strong root and from it we have many branches of music these branches will not destroy the root but they will make it stronger
964376 today country music has grown into many branches country pop and country rock and they are all deeply rooted in country music the melodies survive alongside new hybrids
964377 the same goes for blues reggae and rock for instance there are many branches of rock in the eighties it was glam rock and metal and in the nineties it was alternative rock these developments are composites and they have a strong root in the original blues based rock why cant our traditional tunes evolve in the same way
964378 p ramlee took traditional sounds and created new music with them the difference was at the time the songs were for entertainment questions of identity race and politics were not as important then as they are now
964379 manan has been doing this much longer he has been experimenting with mixing elements of traditional music with popular tunes through his works with francessca peters and later sheqal says the anthropologist and singer composer
964380 pak ngahs works on siti nurhalizas traditional themed albums are also good examples they are not pure traditional music but many elements of traditional music mixed with pop
964381 these artistes are producing an amalgam of traditional music but m nasirs was a breakthrough
964382 m nasir and siti nurhaliza are good role models for the creative industry
964383 currently the industry focuses on entertainment people just want entertainment cultural identity is not a priority
964384 i want to create our own music that reflects our identity and struggle as a people raises our intellectual level and explores spirituality we must have taste i am not into silly entertainment
964385 this is the journey of our people which shaped us we need to support traditional tunes and help them advance
964386 we must be subtle we must be creative in arranging music so it doesnt sound out of place that is how we make something that is artistic into a commercial hit
964387 my aim is to take our music to the highest level
964388 the very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for and the most you can do is live inside that hope not admire it from a distance but live right in it under its roof

964415 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
964416 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
964417 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
964418 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics

964420 the surveillance system deployed by china for the olympics which includes key pieces of western technology is the most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance system ever
964421 properly used it will definitely increase security at the olympics and western companies will have contributed to that security
964422 whereas the legacy of previous olympics was sports stadiums the legacy of the beijing olympics will be a high tech police state

964434 as we grow up we learn that even the one person that wasnt supposed to ever let you down probably will you will have your heart broken probably more than once and its harder every time youll break hearts too so remember how it felt when yours was broken youll fight with your best friend youll blame a new love for things an old one did youll cry because time is passing too fast and youll eventually lose someone you love so take too many pictures laugh too much and love like youve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youll never get back

964439 good day mr shibuya have you heard anything back from your master
964440 not as of yet oujisama murata san has been very busy with the emperor
964441 would you like some sake or perhaps some company i could my masters mistress come to entertain you with a fan dance or perhaps some tea
964442 i would like to see a demonstration of the fan dance i have seen very little of the dances and music of this place
964443 oh worufram sama would you like to see the gracious yuuri chan in my clothes i sure it would amuse you to see him dressed up as a woman
964444 why we could pretend to swap places come yuuri chan you must help me into your clothes
964445 her first glance the city bows before her knees the second glance the empire falls into ruins
964446 prince wolfram please contact your mother and tell her that you are to be married
964447 married to whom my mother would never accept me if i married outside noble blood
964448 you will find no one of nobler blood in the world prince wolfram your hand has been requested by the emperor of japan you do not have the option to deny this
964449 my mother will never stand for this kind of insult marry a man such a thing is as unnatural as it is sickening to me
964450 in japan it is not so unheard of for two men to be together and the emperor can do as he pleases and you shall do as he pleases prince wolfram you are the third son to your family you would merely be married to a lesser noblewoman arent i right surely you would do your family and country greater service to marry higher than your position and create a great alliance with the far east
964451 forgive me for the deception murata is a good friend of mine and he lets me act as his servant to ground himself every now and then
964452 it was during one of those times when i first saw you wolfram sama
964453 you are just what we need around court someone to point out the obvious and not disguise meaning in flowery words
964454 you have not earned the right to call him by his given name
964455 prince von bielefeld please come to the audience chamber his majesty wishes your presence now
964456 prince wolfram for what reason do you come to this court
964457 i have yet to meet her i have been busy with affairs of state
964458 the russian princess is a dainty creature your majesty she has long red hair and large green eyes she has a beauty spot underneath her left eye please remember that information when you meet the impostor her brother yozak guriere
964459 i thought your majesty enjoyed honesty and beauty you have found neither in prince yozak
964460 i thought you did not want his majesty obviously i misunderstood
964461 have you got anywhere quiet where i can sit and think
964462 yuuri was so confused what was wolfram saying it was obviously something bittersweet from his expression and tone but yuuri didnt understand he told wolfram so
964463 es sollte nicht sein auf diese weise es ist grausam
964464 wolfram whimpered collapsing into yuuris arms the emperor cooed and stroked through the blondes hair desperate to soothe him
964465 wolfram gomen i never finished our conversation earlier it was rude
964466 i find it more offensive that you would risk your health to come to me to apologise heika please go back to bed and rest i am sure that this is against the wishes of your advisors
964467 my health is unfortunately an illness that will not disappear with bed rest its a sickness of the heart please i wish to talk to you it makes me happy
964468 a conversation with you your majesty is always an education however i really must be leaving i stayed merely to hear of your health and now i must return to the inn in which i am staying maiko san will worry
964469 i will send a servant to the place you are staying prince wolfram your majesty has something to discuss with you
964470 a letter arrived here shortly after i was taken ill it is from your mother
964471 my mother has encouraged me to hold affection for you she will arrive in two weeks to discuss things with you she wishes to make an alliance with japan
964472 and what do you feel wolfram an alliance does not need marriage forgive me for saying this but would you willingly become a whore for your country
964473 my country is important to me i would die for it if my mother believes that this will greatly help our country then i will do anything to live up to her expectations it is an order in the flowery guise of my mothers handwriting
964474 my mother is the ruling head of state but all decisions are made by her brother stoffel he will have whispered poisons in my mothers ear and she will have made her decision with clouded judgment
964475 i do not wish for you to be hurt because of my stupidity
964476 an emperor should not admit his ignorance to one lesser than him
964477 so i will leave you to think about this news
964478 of what is there to think my mother will arrive and expect a wedding it will be nice to see her smile she hasnt smiled so much since the war with france began
964479 i know that this is not of your own choice but certain traditions must be upheld
964480 the emperors bride must always look grateful to be in her lovers company and also cold and untouchable to all others she must be an example to all women of what a wife should be obedient respectful calm composed beautiful and elegant
964481 yuuri knew i was none of those things when he chose me i will be loyal and i will obey his wishes i cannot promise any more than that
964482 prince you pose a great danger to his majesty many will oppose this marriage please do not antagonize the court
964483 i will be whatever makes my emperor happy if youll excuse me i must pack
964484 im not entirely sure hes let it sink in yet he was extremely calm far too calm if you ask me
964485 he will fall in love with yuuri havent you seen it in his eyes so much fire he is passionate and we both know that it compliments the water of yuuris personality perfectly
964486 im only worried about yuuris over eagerness he needs to give wolfram time to adjust but that wont happen yuuri sometimes has blinkered vision
964487 we may be able to put into play certain tactics to distract him
964488 no my misguided friend i mean an engagement party a yui no surely holding one would calm the two of them down a little and politically it can be used to show a little strength in the new couple
964489 ill head up to the palace gunter will want to begin planning straight away
964490 i have information for your emperor my sister nicola i mean josephine got herself pregnant by a very powerful german aristocrat named huber they eloped about six months ago your swiss court is hiding them
964491 im sorry conrad i know you were fond of her
964492 they said youd changed monsieur conrad i would think first before you make a widow out of my sister
964493 it is tradition yui no must happen when the two families are agreed usually both families are together but these are special circumstances
964494 i have no problems with such an arrangement when will it be
964495 one week all those attending your marriage ceremony will arrive by then and remain here until your wedding now what will you wish to wear seasonal colours or perhaps something that will match your eyes
964496 why dont you ask him he is in his rooms
964497 go on that way you can be sure that you will please the emperor and he can choose his own robes accordingly
964498 what kind of emperor lies in bed half the day
964499 they are holding an engagement party for us arent they
964500 yes flurin sent me to ask you to tell me what colours i should wear
964501 cant you just wear something youre comfortable with your uniform for instance
964502 everyone will want to see me as your bride not as wolfram von bielefeld i am an extension of you now i automatically forfeit my identity in such matters
964503 it would please me if you would wear blue then flurin will know the kimono i mean
964504 i was bored anyway theres nothing for me to really do after flurin leaves
964505 learning the japanese language could kill boredom and be useful to you you know
964506 no buts yuuri my mother asks something of me i do it i am to become the empress of japan the least you can do is act like a real emperor
964507 would you rather i ignore you wolfram that i treat you with disdain perhaps you think i should have made you a concubine instead
964508 any other emperor would have just bedded you and kept you as a pet until he grew bored then hed have had you killed instead i tried my best to do things right i didnt treat you like some cheap whore and i never planned on treating you like one thats why i asked you to be my wife not my concubine
964509 you should return to your room gunters worried you might have tried to kill yourself
964510 why did you describe my mother to the court when trying to stop the marriage
964511 i never met josephine or nicola or whatever it is you call her i had only met your mother i just knew that you werent her
964512 her nickname has always been nicola shes adopted into the family which is why she doesnt look a think like me or my mother her name was changed to the more royal sounding josephine
964513 why does it matter to you whether or not he knows
964514 then go apologise any sane person can see you dont hate him but the emperor is running mad right now so god knows what hes thinking
964515 i wanted to apologise for last night it was a stupid thing to say
964516 im glad you did things the way you did yuuri i dont think id have liked being a concubine much
964517 can you give me time to get used to this im still tangled
964518 aa i must go wolfram but i will walk through the gardens with you later if youd like
964519 the dead are buried under the sakura its believed that the blossoms become pink from the blood of the corpse underneath
964520 every year usually on the spring equinox our family send wishes up the chimney
964521 we write our wishes on paper and attach the scroll to herbs we burn them on the fire and the smell spreads throughout the house its a nice tradition i think
964522 you have to find the herbs yourself you need to pick a scent that matches your wish
964523 well i use rosemary for romance matters lavender for money and mint for health these are only my own herbs though every individual should choose their own scents for their own wishes
964524 youre exactly how id imagined youd be strong proud honest i prayed so hard that id find someone who would make me more than an emperor someone who would see me as a man and now that ive found you everything screams at me to let you go to let you choose your own destiny
964525 you should always burn your wishes on sandalwood then right
964526 no but he looks a bride fit for an emperor come prince wolfram i do believe theres a party along the way
964527 now my beautiful bride to be is here i believe its time for presents
964528 im representing queen cheri im here to give the emperor his customary gift
964529 this is a hakama its given to the groom as a representation of fidelity
964530 yuuri we must allow maiko san access to the palace
964531 konbu i had no idea you had a sense of humour tanaka san a most amusing gift im sure
964532 its a mocking gift wolfram konbu is given to wish the couple many healthy children the man who gave it to me was trying to get me to marry his own daughter
964533 i have i brought you the yui no yuu chan i thought that it would be appropriate
964534 ah youre my boys fianc arent you youre even more like an angel than the gossipers described
964535 the yui no is made from willow it represents a pledge of obedience and gentleness in marriage somehow i think my mother is trying to tell me something
964536 is he jealous of this marriage will he try to stop it
964537 im so worried that something will happen that something will turn everything upside down i just want to get married and live in peace for a while
964538 yeah but i have no idea what yuuri intends to do with them i put aside gifts from those considered close friends the rest i assume will go into storage
964539 yes ive already decided exactly where some of those trinkets are going in my room and what kimono i shall wear that obi with thank you conrad
964540 youve got a bossy one on your hands there yuuri sama
964541 i know i am hoping that it mellows in age
964542 oh no i am sure that your beautiful bride shall be forever nagging until his last breath
964543 i am not a nag i just know my own mind
964544 you should dance you know at least before our soon to be empress falls asleep
964545 a waltz is a little more easy to do when you can take full strides
964546 y you didnt have to i dont plan on dancing more than is necessary
964547 i think ill retire for the night now it has been a very full day
964548 you are not yet their empress prince wolfram they do not need to answer you
964549 you are dressed that way so you may have an official audience with his majesty come you are expected
964550 you will think different when you get to know his majesty
964551 there are two men in that room who will do anything to prevent you from marrying the emperor one wishes to marry him to a russian princess the other is merely jealous of anyone whom his majesty loves gwendal and gunter are the emperors most trusted advisors and you must persuade them that this marriage will no be a mistake
964552 gwendal will most likely order your execution and send your body back to germany in disgrace
964553 wolfram sama please accept my apologies for gunters complete lack of common sense
964554 your country is very beautiful sir but your hospitality leaves much to be desired your houses are cold your food is an acquired taste your customs make no sense and your writing and language are incomprehensible
964555 perhaps in time you will acquire a taste for our country it is not so bad as it may seem
964556 for what reason would i like you emperor for forcing me to marry you for trapping me in a country i hate for going against every ounce of honour i have and humbling me breaking me in like a wild horse
964557 but what would a savage king like you care about a westerner
964558 you will learn about honour prince wolfram not that poor imitation you westerners believe in but true honour you will be mine prince of germany
964559 there is too much fire in his personality have him spend some time with flurin san she will perhaps tame some of that wild spirit
964560 if you ever talk to his majesty in that way again not even god himself will excuse you his majesty saved you today from death no doubt remember that
964561 i should have courted him properly and won his heart rather than just brashly ordering him to marry me
964562 it was my rashness as an emperor my own overbearing feelings that clouded my judgment
964563 the prince is proud but not in a way that will prevent him from accepting an order once queen celi sends her consent he will calm
964564 if she does not send back her blessing what then
964565 queen celi will have no problem marrying wolfram san to you she holds affection for him beyond all her other children she knows that wolfram will be well provided for here and no matter what wolfram san believes he will be treated with great respect a country needs a beautiful empress
964566 the emperor ordered that everything placed in your rooms should be as beautiful as his
964567 the emperors rooms are adjoined to these that door there
964568 i see that you are getting used to movement in kimono its easy once you get used to it ne
964569 i do not wish for any such bond with you your majesty
964570 i was once told that i would forsake my country for love the pretty song you heard is that prophecy i am tempting fate will you destroy my empire wolfram
964571 you would base your whole marriage and rule on the prophecy of an insane person
964572 i would and i will risk this empire to have you by my side now why dont we speak of lighter things
964573 your eyes theyre truly amazing i have never seen such a colour before
964574 there is no need for formalities here you may use this room as your own after all in a months time you will be expected to spend a certain amount of time in here
964575 a month is too soon it will take my mother about that long to get here please reconsider yuuri
964576 i wish for us to be married as soon as possible i am not used to waiting on other people
964577 i am not a jewel to be collected by a wimpy emperor
964578 no you are not something to be kept or tamed you are something to admire though your strength your determination the way you look entranced by the smallest of things the fire that burns so deeply in your eyes your honesty
964579 i am not some pretty bird to be kept in your cages
964580 i have done you a great wrong wolfram i i was too hasty too cruel i will talk to my advisors and see if they can arrange a marriage to the russian princess
964581 it is all right wolfram you only missed the introductions this is qian cao he is the emperor of chinas brother
964582 qian cao this is wolfram von bielefeld a prince of germany
964583 my wife also packed a case of gifts for the empress or your future bride she heard that you were betrothed to someone but i see no sign of an empress in your court
964584 why dont you try on one of those new outfits show our ambassador that a japanese empress is just as beautiful as the many chinese empresses
964585 i will change into one of these if that would please you later i will show you all the gifts i have received perhaps we can decide together whether or not certain things should be worn during our wedding ceremony
964586 i want what you wear to be a surprise to me please ask flurin if it is appropriate and do not ruin the surprise after all it is western custom is it not
964587 yes my first wife is here she is in the ante chamber
964588 perhaps she can help me dress i wouldnt want to make a fool of myself in front of the court
964589 it seems that the beauty of the japanese court may even beat the beauty of all the maids in shanghai one glance from such a beauty could stop the heart
964590 qian ziyi helped me to choose the outfit that was most appropriate for today she has also pointed me to some beautiful things for our wedding day yuuri sama i am sure that it would please you if i wore some of them to our wedding party
964591 if they all make you look so beautiful i give you full permission to dress in them every day
964592 just make sure you never dress like that for anyone other than me
964593 of course i am glad we could reach such profitable arrangements this morning
964594 he is in love with you yuuri otherwise he would have fought harder against his mothers orders
964595 but wolfram believes that hell awaits him if he allows himself to love you relationships with men are forbidden in britain they are even outlawed you must understand that homosexuality is frowned upon in western culture
964596 god damnit gwendal how patient can a person be you saw him today he was giving off all the signals
964597 and perhaps all those signals were subconscious on wolframs part hes attracted to you thats true but you are dealing with a sixteen year old virgin prince who has no experience in romance and believes its wrong to have erotic thoughts about other men in the course of a season youve managed to get him from afraid of you to being able to accept your touch even in the most mild mannered of ways that is an accomplishment yuuri do not expect him to just jump into your bed because youre the emperor you already know that your title does not impress him
964598 i will apologise to him i i have to let him know that im not just after his body
964599 i dont know what to feel sometimes i hate you more than i think its possible to hate anyone but sometimes when you hold me like this i know that i could spend forever just standing here i dont know why i just want to be able to live this life with no regrets
964600 the romans who created your religion of christianity supported homosexual love they did not care whether or not it was a man or a woman as long as they loved them and were devoted to them in ancient greece the motherland of your entire culture they encouraged homosexual love so much that at one point if a boy hadnt been abducted at least once by an older man they would think there was something wrong with him
964601 its certainly not something youll learn at any church is it
964602 wolf oh look at you youve grown and look at your colouring you look so well
964603 be careful with him mother it will do no one any good if you smother him
964604 oh wolf we have so much to catch up on i want you to tell me everything
964605 your majesty there are a few documents i need you to sign before your marriage to prince wolfram goes ahead a few trade agreements and the like nothing too inflexible
964606 really heika you should be a little nicer to wolframs uncle
964607 aa but i prefer to make him squirm after all its up to cheri sama what happens ne
964608 i met him during the summer i was visiting a merchant named murata ken yuuri was working as a servant for him i think it was just something to do to get away from the court for a while i didnt really pay much attention to him to be honest he just flitted about getting things for me
964609 it was a geisha who helped i suppose she dressed yuuri up in her clothes then forced him to perform a fan dance i guess he did it to get my attention
964610 i will have to take you to a performance in the spring mother the way the women dance is lovely if not a little strange you will enjoy it im sure
964611 he did not ask me mother the emperor asks for nothing
964612 oh but you are settling in well he is a kind fianc right
964613 wolfram not all things in this world are black and white
964614 look at the world around you do you sense evil in it when yuuri looks at you and calls you beautiful says he wants to marry you is there any malicious intent in those eyes
964615 how can what is written in a book make someone evil yes our bible proclaims that you and yuuri would be sent to hell for your crimes it also says that we should love and be happy and true to ourselves you should allow yourself all those things wolfram
964616 its always so peaceful in your room wolfram so much calmer than yuuris
964617 ah the be the wife of an emperor i dont suppose yuuri would like to swap you for a more mature model
964618 if you really want something mother just ask for it
964619 no you cant have that one i didnt realise i had put that one out
964620 the kanji on it i was told by flurin that it means okami the japanese for wolf i was i was going to give it to yuuri on our wedding day
964621 which is why i took it off the delicate chain it was on and put it on a leather strap
964622 oh wolfie why dont you just admit that youre in love with him
964623 because i am not i am only here because you ordered me to be
964624 but you said yourself you liked it when he kissed you
964625 the body is a stupid thing and reacts even when the mind is telling it to not like it
964626 oh wolfie who are you trying to fool you cant fool your own mother
964627 oh yes and i remember now another reason i came ive got to give you the same talk my mother gave me before my wedding day
964628 your job as empress is to please your emperor right wolfie
964629 so youve always got to remember to swallow theres nothing more inelegant than spitting
964630 now why dont you tell me whats really been going on here
964631 let me touch you wolfram i wont do anything more than that
964632 no matter how much time i spend around you you always do things like this and totally surprise me
964633 you truly are beautiful wolfram i cant wait until youre finally mine
964634 she gets up while it is still dark she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls
964635 for whatsoever a man sows that will he also reap
964636 she gets up while it is still dark she provides food for her family
964637 love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength
964638 this book is loaded with great ideas you can use immediately to sell more faster and easier than you ever thought possible
964639 when my love say she is made out of truth i do believe her though i know she lies
964640 yea and the black water doth it not keep on rolling and though its a part of the lone star state do the people careth nay but rather they keepeth looking to the east oh brothers ask thyselves without love where would you be now for
964641 i would have gladly denounced allah if they just asked me
964642 i dont know why they had to peel my eyelids back with a pair of fishhooks and shoot flashbulbs into my eyes
964643 times are tough whitey all i know is it aint shit compared to the magicians
964644 it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for any of you bitches to kick my ass at horseshoes
964645 gimme 20 i can get some really good shit right around the corner
964646 everything you read in the newspaper is true except the stuff you know something about
964647 so overspecialized that they make a pediatric endocrinologist seem like a family doctor who makes house calls
964648 we were able to liquidate our portfolios in 15 minutes
964649 if an etfs investing in illiquid securities and has to liquidate in distressed markets
964650 it will have the same problems as a hedge fund
964651 understandably he and his family are extremely upset by the news and in particular the delay in treatment which could have implications on his long term prognosis
964652 to add further insult to injury there seems to be no urgency on the part of the trust to offer immediate treatment for these patients who through no fault of their own have had their diagnoses delayed
964653 my client has had to fight to get an urgent mri scan and even now some four months after the original failings came to light he is still awaiting urgent oncology treatment
964654 the care and wellbeing of patients is of utmost importance to our trust

964662 denise asked for a meeting and made it clear to her new bosses that she wasnt able to handle the early starts as they were impacting on her personal life and her health
964663 it takes a special kind of person to consistently rise early and give the public the level of entertainment they expect each morning denise requested the opportunity to break her contract immediately and we obliged
964664 johnny was an integral part of the initial decision to bring denise into the show i think he was surprised to learn she couldnt cope with the early starts
964665 to captain your country is the ultimate honour in sport and i feel privileged and proud
964666 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
964667 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
964668 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
964669 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
964670 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
964671 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
964672 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
964673 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
964674 there is nothing in what this government is doing to show it understands how to respect devolved government that it appreciates the need for local government to go its own way that it comprehends how its policies are reducing social capital that it realises how the loss of local services weaken community relationships or that it even begins to appreciate how the demands of the centralised bureaucracy are eroding the civic the local and the voluntary
964675 and thats because i fear for gordon brown there really is no such thing as society only the individual and the state
964676 the sad truth is that if you are eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass than you are to get three as at a level
964677 but i do believe that we need to ensure that with a culture which encourages facilitates and celebrates success theres also a parallel culture of responsibility reciprocity and respect
964678 of those to whom much is given much is expected
964679 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments
964680 schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
964681 while he is right to highlight the vital need for good local schools his proposals to increase choice and diversity of schools is diametrically opposed to that idea
964682 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation
964683 all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs

964692 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices and we have recognised this with an impairment charge of 527m on the goodwill of our north american personal financial services business at group level
964693 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cuttting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
964694 todays results come as no surprise to us hsbc has a thriving and extremely valuable business in asia which is why its share price has performed as well as it has in 2008 relative to that of other banks
964695 we would point out however that the subprime and other credit related losses incurred by hsbc in north america since the beginning of 2006 now exceed 32bn that is to say more than all the profits earning in the emerging markets and hong kong over the same period
964696 on the positive side the rate of deterioration has definitely slowed but we have had two quarters of seasonally good factors with tax refund season at the beginning of the year and the fiscal stimulus package in the second quarter
964697 hsbc management suggest that the deleveraging of the financial system plays to their strengths the problems in the us were well flagged but many investors may focus on underlying group revenue up 2 suggesting that the strong growth in developing markets has not been strong enough to offset weakness elsewhere

964700 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
964701 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
964702 kevins a great player a strong character in the dressing room
964703 hes a very fine player in both forms of the game hes a very determined and single minded man who knows what he wants kevin has a lot of qualities that people want in a captain he is a good lad hes a very motivated person
964704 i think the side have got to move forward and by appointing me as captain i dont think that would be a good option there are other people out there that could do a better job
964705 its disappointing the way in which hes gone out it would have been nice if he had gone out on a high hes a fine player and hes someone who will score a lot more runs for england im sure

964853 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
964854 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
964855 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
964856 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
964857 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

964864 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
964865 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

964900 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
964901 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
964902 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
964903 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
964904 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
964905 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
964906 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
964907 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
964908 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
964909 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
964910 the question is how do you make it work for everybody
964911 our physicians arent sure they can take on a deluge of new patients under the rates being offered
964912 this program was supposed to be a safety net for people its shaping up to be more like a sieve
964913 law leaves resolution of this question up to the state legislature and the federal branch

964917 i think the bill before us today is a very narrowly tailored solution to an extremely rare problem that results from a very small number of bad actors
964918 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
964919 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
964920 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
964921 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

964936 as owners and creativity are core elements of scion we wanted to generate an advertising campaign that integrated those aspects in an innovative way
964937 we think the united by individuality campaign will engage our owners as well as show others what the brand is about i cant wait for owners to be surprised when they see their cars in their favorite magazines on a billboard or at the movies
964938 yes our vehicles are polarizing but we are confident our united by individuality campaign will spark positive conversation among scion enthusiasts each vehicle in the campaign is so unique owners will know who a vehicle belongs to or reach out to the scion community to find out our owners are definitely united by individuality and we will continue to support them as they tell us what the brand needs to be
964939 we will maintain our course for adventurous and authentic marketing efforts

964941 the water content of the crust was found to be decisive for the transition point
964942 the distribution of the water in samples with a history of high water content is more inhomogeneous which results in crispy and less crispy regions thus making them overall more crispy than samples with the same water content but higher water activity
964943 water causes hydration which causes a glass to rubber transition of the amorphous regions of the macromolecules present that were initially in the glassy state

964951 a lot of happening in the food industry at the moment as companies continue to devote money to disaster areas and the aid is becoming more strategic
964952 companies are pleased to be seen helping communities is areas where they have a lot of business and china is a very interesting market for all companies right now
964953 there have been strong calls from governments ngos and consumers for global players to participate in development efforts corporate responsibility will increasingly become a priority to companies pushed forward by consumers who are paying more attention to how their food is produced and the impact their lifestyles have on the rest of the world
964954 china is highly strategically important for us as it rapidly growing to become the biggest sub region in the asia pacific area
964955 the country has been increasingly good to use as a business and we believe in giving something back helping in this way is the very least we can do
964956 we want to have links with the school in the future and get actively involved in its running we dream that children can get lectures from people in the company to give the children the opportunity to get involved in the company
964957 there are increasing opportunities for company to help from the grass roots of the production line with work focusing on new technologies and long term opportunities
964958 our hearts go out to the millions of people impacted by the earthquake especially the children who have lost their homes and families we want to play a part to help the chinese people devastated by the earthquake rebuild their lives
964959 we aim to improve the efficiency of distribution systems for food and agriculture products and share our worldwide agriculture and food expertise with chinese government and customers
964960 cargill views it as extremely important to help the communities in which it operates
964961 such a decision would be based on business considerations as it may incur ongoing costs although practical technical restraints may also have a bearing on this

964965 my wife likes to spoon but i prefer to fork
964966 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
964967 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
964968 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
964969 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
964970 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
964971 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
964972 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
964973 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
964974 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
964975 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
964976 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
964977 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
964978 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
964979 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
964980 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
964981 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
964982 still this survival is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
964983 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
964984 to send an airplane that could make a circle around the mountain to see if they can locate anyone
964985 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
964986 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
964987 coming down at dawn in the dark with little oxygen is very very dangerous
964988 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
964989 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
964990 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
964991 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
964992 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
964993 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
964994 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
964995 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
964996 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
964997 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
964998 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
964999 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
965000 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
965001 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
965002 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
965003 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
965004 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
965005 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
965006 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
965007 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
965008 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
965009 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
965010 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
965011 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
965012 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
965013 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
965014 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
965015 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
965016 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
965017 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
965018 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
965019 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

965031 the nation will have to decide as to which kind of islam it wants the world says that pakistan is extremist we will have to prove that we are not so when i say this im dubbed as an american stooge

965035 india has proved to be a valuable ally and is in the forefront of rebuilding afghanistan
965036 its a tribute to indians and afghans who have died while building this road

965068 min mor og far m dte hinanden da min mor der kommer fra argentina var i danmark p et pitstop p vej til sovjetunionen for at fejre en mindedag for revolutionen
965069 i oles unge dage gjorde han stor set alt hvad han kunne for at give en stor fuckfinger til systemet han var ret tidligt ude med en totalbeskrivelse af samfundet som v rende 110 procent forkert
965070 ser man p et parti som enhedslisten m man jo ryste p hovedet det parti er en joke
965071 jeg kan huske alle de her vsere sapere og kapere og deres p duttede solidaritet som skulle hives ned over hovedet p folk
965072 og s noget der selv i dag kan g re mig voldsomt irriteret nemlig attituden omkring at man er et uanst ndigt menneske hvis man stemmer til h jre for midten
965073 da jeg var yngre flirtede jeg med anarkokapitalismen som er en kapitalistisk form for anarkisme jeg var meget nysgerrig omkring en masse ting da jeg var ung jeg l ste ogs om marxisme fascisme og underlige sm bev gelser som jeg ikke sympatiserede med men som jeg alligevel fandt fascinerende
965074 jeg skilte mig gevaldigt ud fordi jeg var h jreorienteret og liberal og hvor det m ske var de andre der ud ad til var radikale s tog jeg nok opr ret ind ad til i den gruppe
965075 det var jo mine venner og er det stadig i dag s jeg gad ikke rigtigt at v re uvenner med dem hele tiden s der blev lagt l g p
965076 jeg kan fra mit kontor i dag se ud over gammeltorv og nytorv og nyder med stor gl de hvordan de autonome holder deres torsdagscirkus s kommer der en masse unge fra forst derne og k ber 10 prince light tager en h ttetr je og noget eyeliner p for at solidarisere med en bev gelse som jeg tvivler p de helt ved hvad g r ud p
965077 og ih hvor er det s fantastisk at vi i dag p national konomisk plan kan se hvor meget det koster at del gge en bydel
965078 det er ikke fordi jeg er imod opr r og til en vis grad civil ulydighed det mener jeg er sundt for vores samfund men der er ikke nogen grund til at g re sig dummere end man er og den generation har en kapacitet som de kan udnytte langt bedre hvis de alts gider
965079 politiet er jo ikke en politisk faktor i danmark de er jo embedsm nd det svarer til at kaste sten efter embedsm ndene i kulturministeriet fordi man synes brian mikkelsen har sagt noget dumt
965080 deres opr r er et udtryk for den danske velstand og i mods tningen til hippierne dengang tror jeg p ingen m de at man kan tilskrive de autonome nogen indflydelse p samfundet det er bare fork lede unger
965081 der er jo en erkendelse som jeg er sikker p de fleste 68ere gjorde p et tidspunkt at hvis man skal ndre samfundet skal man ndre sig selv og at den utopiske ide om bare at st og r be af alt hvad man synes er for d rligt ikke f rer nogen steder hen
965082 det undrer mig at de ildsj le der virkelige gerne vil s tte gang i samfundet ikke bruger deres intellekt bedre men bliver ved med at st og kaste vand p elefanten og tror p at den til sidst v lter det sker ikke
965083 pr v at forestille dig hvad de kunne opn hvis de gad se p hvad f eks informationsteknologi og netv rk betyder i dag og s gjorde sig til eksperter inden for det i stedet for v lger de at kaste med brosten og brande affaldscontainere af det er sgu da lidt pinligt
965084 det blev for konformt og restriktivt n r alle pludselig skulle bestemme hvordan og hvorn r man skulle g p toilettet og hvad man skulle spise ideen med opr ret var jo ikke at skabe et nyt styresystem der var liges rigidt som det man gjorde op med
965085 folk har lov at leve og bo som de vil ogs selv om jeg er uenig eller hellere g r det p en anden m de jeg har det d rligt med at man pr ver at p dutte andre folk ens eget verdenssyn klassisk liberal tankegang
965086 det er klart at 68 generationen var et brud med et dav rende system p rigtig mange fronter et brud der var pr get af venstrefl jen men som ikke n dvendigvis havde beh vet at komme derfra
965087 hvis man ser p argentina gr kenland spanien og portugal har svaret p milit rdiktaturet jo alle steder v ret en venstreorienteret model s det var m ske bare en automatreaktion at det var derfra man br d med et samfunds givne normer i danmark
965088 det er det her jeg gerne vil i mit liv lige nu og hvis folk har det d rligt over det kan jeg kun se det som noget der peger tilbage mod dem selv men ja jeg synes det er sp ndende at m de roman polanski eller tim burton og lave billeder med dem det er inspirerende at arbejde med dygtige og kreative mennesker
965089 og man kan alts godt g op i b de milj og ulandsbistand uden at skulle v re tvangsindlagt til at g i espadrillios fra f tex hele livet
965090 hvis jeg havde st et i et par klip klapper med en fad l i h nden med mit band nede i en k lder havde jeg ikke haft muligheden for at p f re det her nogen reel indflydelse men det har jeg nu
965091 det kan godt v re at revolutionen i n forstand er d d men f lgevirkningerne r kker jo langt ind i samfundet i dag jeg tror bare ikke vi t nker s meget over det l ngere
965092 vi er opdraget med at ingen skal bestemme over vores liv og hvordan vi vil leve det og det tror jeg rent faktisk mange af os udlever
965093 jeg tror at mange af os b rn kommer med en masse gode v rkt jer noget talent og et drive vi er vant til at se p systemet fra en strukturel og kritisk vinkel og jeg tror p at vi p vores egen m de stadig pr ver at bidrage til at g re tingene bedre
965094 man beh ver blot l se p de forskellige tr de i denne avis for at f et indtryk af hvor vreden og hadet er placeret
965095 i will stick to sectors that we remain very bullish on are one is it from standpoint of and you saw a very significant correction from april last year going back to april 2007 to about 2 months ago where it just got beaten black and blue primarily because of the appreciation of the rupee now you have seen the reverse effect where the rupee has depreciated a good 6 7 and that starts to benefit for it so this is per se contributing largely to our economy and we believe that in a very competitive global environment outsourcing is going to continue and that is why we believe it from a long term perspective growth rates are going to be maintained fairly healthy 15 20 and given the correction that they saw over 12 months that is a good place to be
965096 the whole infrastructure story in india continues to be very strong story that you play out over the longer term we are really telling our customers to look long term and there are opportunities we have seen significant price erosion so capital goods is another sector where we see strong order books in place but obviously interest cost are going up and that is going to hurt margins but from a longer term perspective that is another sector that we do like
965097 in telecom the penetration levels the kind of growth rate that we can expect to continue for years to come obviously not as strong as we have seen over the last few years but that is another sector that we continue to be overweight on
965098 triveni engg and bajaj hindustan chart in the short tem still look okay but i wont lay my bets on it there are lots of variables to play in it and i dont think this is a sector in which people would finally have greatest confidence with so keeping everything in mind if one is a short term trader then get the next 4 5 on this take your profits and move out this is not the sector to be in especially from a short to medium term basis
965099 yes bank reported a refreshingly good set of numbers in an otherwise forgettable quarter for the banking sector 1qfy09 net profits grew 51 yoy driven by strong loan and fee income growth lower operating costs and partially offset by higher provision charges key profitability ratios remain good with annualized roa of 1 3 and roe of 16 mtm losses on bond investments were at rs 160 170 million growth so far has been well rounded and healthy and the recent capital infusion of usd 85 million would see it through in fy09 without resorting to any further equity issuance while earnings are estimated to grow at a respectable 37 cagr over fy08 10 we do not expect the stock to rerate beyond our fair value target of 2 5x fy09 pb rs 134 in the current environment add
965100 everest kantos 1qfy09 results were better than our expectation with a revenue growth of 70 yoy and ebitda growth of 97 yoy the yoy numbers are not strictly comparable as this quarters financials include numbers from its recent acquisition of cpi inc us reported ebitda margins were much better at 32 3 up 450 bps yoy this margin improvement was on account of foreign currency translation gains of rs 100 million adjusted margins were a tad below expectation at 27 reiterate buy
965101 dlfs balance sheet remains very well capitalised with leverage at a manageable 0
965102 we are sitting on a lot of resistance here so maybe the next 1 2 is very critical so we need to have a good move something like 5 7 more from here coupled with very good volumes before we come to bigger conclusions so as a short term trader maybe i would like to take some profits out right here

965114 we needed a doha deal to lock in the openness we have benefited from over the last decade we needed a doha deal because the global economy is an uncertain place and every bit of additional certainty every cut and bound tariff every strengthening of the rules and binding in of the big players is in the worlds long term interests
965115 many british families struggling with rising food and fuel bills wont have been aware of these talks but their collapse merely adds to the global economic woes that are affecting so many people in britain
965116 having worked for some time as a trade negotiator i know how difficult it is to cobble together an agreement for over 150 countries but the failure to do so could lead to a devastating outbreak of trade protectionism for which millions of ordinary people in the developing world will suffer
965117 here we have various cases that remain unresolved unclear and it is difficult for us to accept the theory that these are merely cases of common crime
965118 all of the institutions of the state should be audited
965119 when a political institution forces its employees to attend its campaign rallies it could generate weakness within the party

965130 we already have more than 6 000 mosques in europe which are not only a place to worship but also a symbol of radicalization some financed by extreme groups in saudi arabia or iran
965131 its minarets are six floors high these kinds of symbols have to stop
965132 islam is not a religion its an ideology the ideology of a retarded culture
965133 take a walk down the street and see where this is going you no longer feel like you are living in your own country there is a battle going on and we have to defend ourselves before you know it there will be more mosques than churches
965134 they belgians were not able to form a unity government for months because the dutch speaking part and the french speaking part could not agree with each other on their respective role and influence on the state and country in the end it seemed that some kind of consensus had emerged but this only lasted shortly the situation has become so bad now that prime minister yves leterme offered his resignation to the king who then proceeded to reject his and therefore the governments resignation
965135 they are working on the black because there are a lot of companies who need skilled workers these people do not have papers but they have the skills

965168 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
965169 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
965170 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
965171 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
965172 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
965173 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
965174 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
965175 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
965176 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
965177 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day

965186 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
965187 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal

965189 georgia is amassing heavy artillery and grad rocket systems at the border with south ossetia we must consider this situation and prepare measures in line with our agreements with south ossetia and moldovas breakaway region dniester
965190 we will talk with georgia only if georgia complies with all the obligations and documents they signed when they pull out their military troops from kodori which were brought there in breach of all prior agreements
965191 the danger of large scale military action between georgia and south ossetia is getting more and more real
965192 open military maneuvers near tskhinvali gathering troops and armed vehicles for the zone of the georgian ossetian conflict
965193 will not let anyone offend its citizens living on the territory of south ossetia
965194 the problem of homeless animals is very noticeable in tbilisi as well as in all parts of georgia tbilisi city hall cooperates with a contractor which is charged with isolating stray dogs and placing them in shelters

965197 ilia chavchavadze tried to implement positive european ideas but at the same time he protected national self identity

965200 i found the flower of life last summer in india
965201 at the entrance of the baghawan sri sathya sai baba ashram there is a gate that covers and protects ganeshs temple and the whole gates design is made of the flower of life symbol unfortunately photography is not allowed
965202 the first time i ever saw the flower of life motif was last january in the louvre i was studying the mesopotamian section with a friend of mine and i saw the motif carved into a slab of gypseous alabaster thats about 3 and a half feet by 5 and a half feet with carved tassles on all sides it was made to look like a rug and was probably once painted according to the museum it was once laid in the entrance of the ancient palace of assourbanipal in nineva and dates back to c 645 bc i had no idea what the motif was at the time but stood there mesmerized staring at it for well over half an hour i couldnt take my eyes off it i finally managed to peel myself away but kept going back to look at it
965203 in september 2002 i made a trip to turkey in the topkapes palace in istanbul in a room where they keep the suits worn by the sultans what i noticed most were these garments called mystic shirts below these shirts were worn under the clothing and they had a great number of sacred symbols on them to protect the sultan
965204 i have just come back from spain and i found this flower of life in cordoba in la mezquita
965205 my friends were traveling in egypt they were on a special initiation journey along the nile river they took these fol photos in the osirian temple in abydos on january 19 2003
965206 i own a small mom and pop grocery store but im doing well
965207 all were asking is for the picture to move inside so that our families can come back to the mall and we wont have to worry about our children being accosted by these huge sexually explicit photos
965208 take your fathers bull and a second bull seven years old and pull down the altar of baal which belongs to your father and cut down the asherah that is beside it and build an altar to the lord your god on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the asherah which you shall cut down
965209 bring out your son that he may die for he has torn down the altar of baal and indeed he has cut down the asherah which was beside it
965210 will you contend for baal or will you deliver him whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning if he is a god let him contend for himself because someone has torn down his altar
965211 if thou wilt deliver israel through me as thou hast spoken behold i will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor if there is dew on the fleece only and it is dry on all the ground then i will know that thou wilt deliver israel through me as thou hast spoken
965212 do not let thine anger burn against me that i may speak once more please let me make a test once more with the fleece let it now be dry only on the fleece and let there be dew on all the ground
965213 if baal is a god let him contend for himself

965217 i dont see why i shouldnt compose a symphony about myself i find myself quite as interesting as napoleon or alexander
965218 very feminine a little perverse a little coquettish at every minute different from how she had been the moment before

965220 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
965221 spectras floating entities that radiate light like holy shrines to old world gods
965222 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
965223 i think it is still very very close and it is very difficult to draw any conclusions who is ahead
965224 it is so sensitive at the moment that if you dont get the set up perfect and if you dont get the tyres feeling perfect and if you dont get your driving perfect there are going to be three or four guys ahead of you straight away
965225 i think it is quite interesting i think it is really spectacular for all the fans
965226 for us it puts a lot of pressure on everybody to maximise everything but it should be a very interesting end of the season with all the teams pushing very hard to see who comes out on top at the end
965227 we have the speed in the race but if we cannot qualify we cannot use it and we saw that again today
965228 most of the race i was stuck behind alonso and once i got on my own i could go almost a second faster on my in lap
965229 we need to get something sorted and get in the front and then we can fight for wins for sure
965230 the car seems to be working well we just need to find a good set up again
965231 its been a bit difficult for me in the last few races but we are still in the championship so its not too bad
965232 the developments we have on our car here were destined for valencia and to accelerate our programme took a lot of effort and a lot of all nighters which is an unheard of thing in motor racing these days
965233 what we try to do is to make the car faster for every race and our next really big step is going to be monza from now to valencia is really going to be fine tuning

965237 i commend the supreme court for issuing a temporary restraining order on the signing of the memorandum of agreement between the government peace panel and the moro islamic liberation front
965238 the entire country deserves more time to study the legal constitutional and socio economic implications of this particular agreement
965239 i hope that the arroyo government learns from this experience by exercising more transparency and circumspection it should start by opening the grp milf agreement to full scrutiny by the supreme court congress the local government units and people of mindanao and other concerned sectors
965240 the foremost duty of the president is to protect the territorial integrity of the nation
965241 but it must not be obtained at the expense of our territorial integrity and certainly not by methods that desire transparency and are in apparent haste
965242 on a positive note the tro will provide opportunity for everyone now to dispassionately and objectively view and examine the draft moa an early legal and constitutional test wil further strengthen the agreement
965243 a little delay will not matter if ultimately we achieve what every mindanaoan has long been dreaming of
965244 i dont remember if there have been accusations of this magnitude affecting the appellate court justices in recent history this would be a first
965245 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations

965257 were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
965258 im telling the development team to not think about the xbox 360 right now we can think about it after the development kits arrive
965259 i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint

965282 joshua fit the battle of jericho and the walls came tumbling down
965283 the jericho forum began in 2003 when a group of global corporate cisos chief information security officers came together informally to discuss an issue that no one was addressing de perimeterization the erosion of the network perimeter
965284 this year we are also launching friends of the suffolk regiment as it has been almost 50 years since the last soldier was recruited into the suffolk regiment
965285 as the old soldiers fade away there is a need for an organisation to keep the memory alive and in the public eye it is open to families friends historians or anyone who would like to support the regiment
965286 it is hoped we can find enthusiastic volunteers who can help out at future events battlefield tours and minden day itself
965287 it is something we would definitely be interested in now the regiment has disappeared it is important to keep the memory alive
965288 i have been coming every year since 1979 and it has been a very good turnout it is a good get together and we should keep it going strong
965289 its quite an achievement its like winning a commonwealth gold medal when you routinely didnt make the finals of the olympic finals or to use a far more apt analogy its like wanting to fuck natalie portman and waking up with helen mirren
965290 job growth at the executive level is not moving in lockstep with the rest of the employment market
965291 thanks in part to an aging workforce and global economic growth the demand for executive talent continues to increase while the threat of a recession looms
965292 the closing of the salary gap based on gender is a welcome surprise
965293 studies have shown the gap closing over time but im thrilled to hear the playing field has leveled out
965294 we were surprised to learn that such a high proportion of parents heavily rely on verbal agreements to ensure their childrens online activities are safe and legal
965295 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
965296 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
965297 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
965298 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
965299 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
965300 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result
965301 and im here for one reason ive got to protect the health of the people i represent

965308 what part of what happened this year to the offense did you forsee
965309 ricciardi is only saying what he is required to say by the rules of public relations
965310 there are over 4 000 competitive cyclists in the u s only 11 of them are at this level there is no race at a higher level in the u s usually you would think that a road race weekend like this would be held in los angeles or new york city to have this event in rochester is huge
965311 with the success of last years race a three day race was a natural progression
965312 i like the technically advanced and fast course and of course the amount of the people that come out and support the race
965313 twenty five to thirty thousand people cheering can be pretty motivational
965314 we actually already have a sold out field its full you have to be on a team to participate and each team usually has four to six guys so drafting and team order racing tactics will be in full force
965315 ive always done all different kinds of cycle racing growing up in rochester graduating from hilton high school
965316 i started the 2004 criterium four years ago and i wanted to get into something bigger and thats why i went to this years three day event
965317 it doesnt get any better than this yet each year the event gets bigger and bigger
965318 its all about the sport of cycling growing bigger and bigger each year
965319 clark has won the criterium event the past two years and he tells me he his gunning to come back and three peat
965320 circuit city headquarters has ordered their stores to destroy all copies of the latest issue of
965321 i am very upset that they wont take a good hard look at this
965322 i think we need to give the voters the opportunity to voice their choice i think ron thinks this problem is going to go away
965323 there is no reason for us to be charged twice
965324 i could not get the information from the county to move forward with that committee
965325 the only part of that i disagree with is the road service
965326 we go into penfield i dont send them a bill
965327 the town board members feel very comfortable with the number of police officers now
965328 we are working diligently to come up with the data for these services
965329 i can tell you from a state perspective it is a very complex issue there is a myriad of issues that need to be discussed
965330 people in the webster community stand square behind their police department i have never heard one negative comment about the police department
965331 online poker marketing could spell the naked end of viagra journalism as we lohan know it
965332 still this survival is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
965333 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
965334 to send an airplane that could make a circle around the mountain to see if they can locate anyone
965335 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
965336 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
965337 coming down at dawn in the dark with little oxygen is very very dangerous
965338 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
965339 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
965340 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
965341 i am looking forward to coming in here and helping this team as much as i can i want to get into that end zone and help this team get some more touchdowns
965342 it doesnt necessarily have to be right in the middle but at some point hes going to run through the middle of the field and catch the ball near it or on it in traffic and make plays for us if hes going to be a premier receiver in the national football league
965343 hes got the willingness and hes never shown us that he doesnt hes working awfully hard at it
965344 i like his attitude i like his approach to the game
965345 hes very confident he has like quiet confidence he definitely wants to come in here and score some touchdowns and help us out
965346 it was just something that i had to get through
965347 i am happy to be here as part of the buffalo bills organization and contribute this season
965348 it was great to get to a bowl game after not getting to one after 13 years it was great experience for everyone involved at indiana football
965349 i think its about time they did something to recognize her
965350 theres just not enough words to describe what she does for this place
965351 i said next time we meet bring a friend not necessarily from the church but as long as theyre 60 or more
965352 and we grew and grew at that time there were very few seniors groups at all in the city or the suburbs
965353 i thought they should make a senior center when they were doing it and they did when it was built it was supposed to be the senior center and as the years went by the powers that be started calling it the community center but it was always ours first
965354 shes really taken the program and gotten it going shes just done a tremendous amount for the residents and the seniors of the village and we just wanted to show our appreciation
965355 theyve always got something going on if you dont have anything to do for the day you can always come down and find something to do if it wasnt for jean we probably wouldnt be here she keeps it going and makes sure everybodys got somebody
965356 its corny but its brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people
965357 we were very fortunate to find a place out here
965358 converts a date a time or a text string to a decimal fraction of a 24 hour day
965359 the time function converts hours minutes and seconds into a time format
965360 converts a date a time or a text string to a decimal fraction of a 24 hour day
965361 the time function converts hours minutes and seconds into a time format
965362 converts a date a time or a text string to a decimal fraction of a 24 hour day
965363 first of all it may be recalled that we have condemned this incident in the strongest terms
965364 against this background the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
965365 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
965366 it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalised counter terrorism mechanism which is working satisfactorily
965367 the delhi blasts occurred oct 29 and my son took birth on dec 16 i want to see my son
965368 sometimes i feel proud for saving so many lives but some other times i want to see my two and half year old son will i ever be able to do that
965369 every time i listen to the news of some bomb blasts i feel dejected i relive that saturday when i lost everything my eyes one ear one hand and ability to see my family
965370 my son pradeep kumar is a baby now but when he will grow up he will also feel proud for being the son of a brave father
965371 i have lived that moment and dont want anyone to face the same situation i fail to understand what terrorists get by killing innocent people
965372 i am thankful to authorities but the salary of rs 3 250 is too little to support a family
965373 they are treating me free i am going once in six months for eye check up
965374 therefore if one is poor and hungry he can go and pick up berries and mushrooms and sell them to sustain himself
965375 we are a cold country and there are times when the temperature in the winters can go down to minus 30 degrees a sauna is therefore a must in almost every household
965376 but there are other cold countries and they probably dont have as many saunas as we do here sauna is a ritual a way of life i guess its a very finn thing
965377 he just turns and plays that ball off the wall and gets it in so fast i didnt realize that
965378 9 prior problems didnt dissuade you from buying another product eh
965379 you know its tilted but this is within in the spec i mean if its 90 degrees off i understand but this slight tilt is within in the spec
965380 see that there is no mention of ipod nano shipped with non tilted screen therefore its acceptable to be tilted and is not considered defective its the company policy does that make sense
965381 it doesnt effect any function of the ipod so why complain
965382 send it back and within two weeks well repair it
965383 our technicians have performed full diagnostic checks on your ipod nano 3rd generation and have been unable to reproduce the symptom s you reported when you requested the repair as a result of our tests we can confirm that your product meets apple specifications for performance usability and functionality
965384 as a registered nurse frias should have acted in a way that justified the trust and confidence of the public and he failed to do so in acting as he did further he failed to uphold and enhance the good reputation of the profession by his acts he further failed to maintain professional boundaries and also breached confidentiality when using confidential information inappropriately obtained to his own needs by imposing a caution order of 5 years the panel feels this reflects the serious nature of the misconduct
965385 an estimated forty one per cent of children in mozambique suffer from chronic malnutrition
965386 these resources will help children and their families who are at high nutritional risk
965387 the va made its initial decision to fully compensate gulf war veterans with als in 2001
965388 for seven years the als advocacy community has pushed to get all als affected service people included in that package of care this is wonderful news for the als community
965389 its also a great way to encourage linkages between the newly graduated students and the society
965390 adam is a very diligent student who balances his life with a high commitment to professional sport
965391 adam is the epitome of the type of graduate we would encourage to join the masters program he has high level communication skills and a dedication to excellence in practice
965392 it was a great class so it was exciting to be at the top
965393 it is assessed on both a students written work and oral communication skills and takes into account feedback from external placement preceptors
965394 belinda brought with her an extensive experience of clinical work before taking on her pharmacy degree
965395 im pleased that all my years of hard work in pharmacy have been recognised and honoured that the psa act branch committee decided to choose me
965396 these figures prove the alcohol industry has been trying to mislead the australian community on the alcohol issue just like the tobacco industry did in the 1980s the alcohol industry can no longer be trusted and should have no role in developing more effective policy to reduce alcohol related harm in australia
965397 this new information proves the alcohol industry deliberately misled the public politicians and policymakers the data they put forward last week was totally misleading because they had the more comprehensive ac nielsen data all along this was a deliberate attack on the government to try and remove a health policy that is against their commercial interest
965398 it is important the government urgently set up a new body to approve and monitor alcohol advertising independent of the alcohol industry who can no longer be trusted with this important role
965399 this new information also affirms research from all over the world that taxation is a major way to reduce alcohol harm and provides the rudd government with great confidence that a total over haul of alcohol taxation in australia with have a significant influence in changing the alcohol culture in this country
965400 this means that the alcohol industry just cant be trusted
965401 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
965402 it was a difficult decision because this suspension of activities leaves the people with no medical care but it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
965403 this government has taken swift action for alberta farmers to reopen the mexican border to albertas high quality seed potatoes
965404 mexico is one of canadas top markets for seed potatoes and this agreement delivers more results for canadian producers
965405 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much much higher than among white women
965406 sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 of the us population
965407 education plays an important role because hiv is more prevalent in their communities women of color need to know they are more likely to be exposed to hiv
965408 all women should understand how to protect themselves such as limiting their number of partners and using condoms consistently
965409 physicians can explain to their patients that hiv screening is recommended for all adults now and that there are numerous benefits to being tested
965410 we need to continue to destigmatize hiv screening and make it a part of routine care
965411 human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and women of color
965412 women represent the fastest growing population of persons infected with hiv in this country and heterosexual transmission has become a much bigger factor
965413 there are two basic messages for patients every woman should know her hiv status and its a simple test
965414 acog recommends routine hiv screening for all women ages 19 to 64 regardless of pregnancy status or what their risk factors might be
965415 acog also recommends targeted screening for women outside this age range who are at high risk for example all sexually active teenagers under 19 should be tested as well as women older than 64 who have had multiple partners in recent years
965416 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
965417 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
965418 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
965419 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
965420 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
965421 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
965422 kill his co workers because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges
965423 as soon as the legal constraints barring disclosure are removed we will make public as much information as possible
965424 we will do that at one time in one place we will do that after those who were injured and the families of those who died are briefed which is only appropriate
965425 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million dollars for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
965426 public accountability is crucial because it relates to how we should respond to future biological or chemical attacks
965427 this years theme lifting the lid on lunch focuses on the benefits of having a calcium rich lunch at primary school to maximise peak bone mass and support our kids as they grow
965428 osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become fragile and brittle leading to a higher risk of fractures
965429 at the age of 30 maximum bone density is reached and most of this is achieved by puberty when there is the greatest rate of bone growth
965430 although genetic factors largely determine the size and density of your bones there are many lifestyle factors such as good nutrition regular exercise and avoiding smoking and excess alcohol that you can control
965431 if you are concerned you may be at risk of osteoporosis talk to your general practitioner
965432 this study differs from previous studies because it uses actual reimbursement data for the three procedures and analyzes a very large data set
965433 additionally this follows another study published in surgical endoscopy which showed that minimally invasive gallbladder removal and hysterectomy reduced the overall odds of acquiring hospital acquired infections by more than 50 when compared to open surgery this suggests that the cost savings of minimally invasive surgery compared to open is even greater than what is indicated in the present study
965434 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
965435 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
965436 it is devastating to stand by and watch people growing sicker and sometimes dying as they wait weeks and even months before being treated simply because there are not enough health care workers
965437 overworked underpaid and undervalued health care workers in southern africa are increasingly scarce just as the number of hiv patients is rising antiretrovirals may be present on more hospital and clinic shelves but without the health staff to administer them a deadly gap will only grow wider
965438 mir fehlen die worte um diesen sieg beschreiben zu k nnen
965439 wir m ssen allen leuten danken die im hintergrund entscheidend an dem erfolg mitgewirkt haben allen in den fabriken in italien und deutschland die tag und nacht am auto gearbeitet haben
965440 wir haben als team einen tollen job gemacht denn wir haben das gesamte wochenende nicht einen einzigen fehler gemacht
965441 wir hatten an diesem wochenende wirklich einen schutzengel weil um uns herum so viele dinge passiert sind
965442 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
965443 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
965444 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
965445 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
965446 the discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
965447 data mining in a behavioral test detects early symptoms in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
965448 it appears that higher quality articles in other words more citable articles are simply made freely available
965449 previous studies using different methods simply got cause and effect reversed
965450 the established dogma is that freely available scientific articles are cited more because they are read more
965451 we found that open access publishing may reach more readers than subscription access publishing but there is no evidence that freely accessible articles are cited any more than subscription access articles
965452 there were definitely more article downloads for freely accessible articles
965453 yet nearly half of these downloads were by internet indexing robots like google crawling the web for free content
965454 there are many reasons to provide free access to the literature
965455 to find something new in the well known galactose network after predicting it is extremely exciting
965456 the more we know about gene networks the more we learn about how they can fail
965457 much of gene regulation appears to deal with changes in the environment our new work demonstrates that you can modify the environment in a highly controlled way and then monitor single cells in order to see how specific gene networks respond to the environmental changes
965458 we didnt expect that yeast would respond so quickly to changes in glucose levels until we did these experiments
965459 the experimental system was much better than the computational models predicted the model started filtering out the glucose pulses too soon
965460 we drove our system with a sine wave in typical engineering fashion and sure enough we learned something interesting
965461 dieser sieg f hrt meine serie von magischen momenten im leben fort zuerst der zweite platz in le mans dann die hochzeit mit meiner alessandra und nun dies dieser erfolg bertrifft alle unsere erwartungen aber er ist ganz bestimmt verdient weil nicht einer unserer konkurrenten ausgefallen ist
965462 das team hat einfach toll gearbeitet auch strategisch das auto lief im training gut und im rennen die ganze zeit auch je mehr stunden vergangen waren umso entschlossener sind wir alle zusammen aufgetreten um diesen historischen erfolg zu sichern
965463 schade f r felipe das tut mir wirklich leid f r ihn und ferrari
965464 aber wir kennen so etwas auch zum beispiel von mika h kkinen 1999 in barcelona aber die wichtigste aufgabe im motorsport ist halt ins ziel zu kommen so simpel sich das auch anh rt
965465 f r einen schlechten tag war das ein gro artiges resultat
965466 nat rlich bin ich sehr entt uscht aber wir werden zur ckschlagen die zuversicht ist trotzdem da auch nach einem rennen wie diesem z hlt das was wir gezeigt haben wir hatten gro artiges tempo und ein fantastisches teamwork das ist gut f r die n chsten rennen
965467 was kann ferrari von einem piloten noch mehr verlangen massa hat ein perfektes rennen bestritten
965468 beeindruckender massa sein auto verr t ihn drei runden vor dem triumph
965469 das ist ein gro artiger moment f r mich und mein team das mit mir durch all die schwierigen zeiten gegangen ist
965470 auf dieses ziel habe ich hingearbeitet seit ich die chance gesehen habe irgendwann einmal in der formel 1 zu fahren
965471 von seinen leistungen und ohne die fehler f r die er nichts konnte w re er auch in der lage gewesen im kreis der toppunktesammler mitzumischen
965472 von den zwei litern in meiner flasche habe ich vielleicht nur 0 2 liter getrunken und zwischendurch habe ich schon mal nach einer toilette gesucht
965473 als es dann zu regnen begann hatten wir eine super strategie
965474 wir befanden uns in unserem boxenfenster so dass wir nur noch einmal zum tanken kommen mussten wenn es gr n bliebe und es blieb tats chlich gr n
965475 wir haben definitiv eine chance denn zur zeit scheint f r uns die sonne
965476 vor uns fuhren direkte konkurrenten und hinter uns auch wir versuchen jetzt weitere top 5 und top 10 platzierungen zu holen und keine fehler zu machen
965477 meine qualifikation war schlecht und dann haben wir uns auch noch einen plattfu eingefangen
965478 als wir dann weiter vorne im feld fuhren waren wir gleich eine sekunde schneller unterwegs als im mittelfeld da f hlst du dich wie superman
965479 als wir vor der regenunterbrechung nicht in die box gingen wussten wir dass wir f r drei runden zu wenig sprit im tank hatten wir wussten auch dass die konkurrenz es mit einem stopp schaffen w rde aber wir haben auf mehr regen oder ein paar gelbphasen gesetzt
965480 so wie wir heute hier stehen wollen wir beide fahrer behalten
965481 timo hat in hockenheim bewiesen dass er speziell im rennen sehr schnell ist dann hatte er seinen unfall aber an diesem wochenende hat er genau dort weitergemacht wo er in hockenheim herausgerissen wurde
965482 es passierte beim anbremsen ich sah dass sich direkt vor mir zwei konkurrenten berholten also ging ich etwas fr her vom gas um kein risiko einzugehen
965483 in dem moment als ich auf die bremse ging drehte sich mein dbr9 um 180 grad dann rutschte ich seitlich an den reifenstapeln entlang traf einen konkurrenten auf der strecke bevor ich dann ultimativ auf der anderen seite in die barrieren krachte
965484 die einzige erkl rung ist dass ich beim anbremsen auf einen feuchten fleck gekommen sein muss
965485 der ausfall ist ganz besonders bitter weil wir bis dorthin gut gefahren waren
965486 ich komme mit mir selbst nicht klar ich bin heute einfach zu langsam
965487 we are living in dwarka for the past five years and never interacted with any police officer no one ever came to our house to interact over any issue we dont even know who our beat officer is
965488 earlier one policemen used to often visit our society and would listen to our problems but with the passage of time these visits have became erratic
965489 earlier the policemen were very respectful now the young officers are not only rude and but very unhelpful it seems that they have only restricted their duties to extracting money from the innocent people
965490 people try to avoid them if some cop is passing by
965491 earlier we used to take a complete round of our respective area in two three hours but these days it takes at least 15 days to do a single round seven eight years ago we could tell on our fingertips the number of people living in a colony and who owns which car or bike
965492 these days we are overburdened with work which ranges from servant verification to maintaining law and order in the area of a police station delivering court summons and carrying out investigations takes a lot of time
965493 we are not only doing the job of the beat policing there so many things we have to do we are also roped in when there is any violence and tension in other police station areas
965494 due to lack of time and rise in day to day crime incidents focus has shifted from intelligence gathering to maintaining law and order and solving crimes we hardly get time to develop sources in a particular area
965495 till a few years ago people used to often say police have a strong information network and can arrest any suspect whenever they want but i am sorry to say that the same doesnt exist anymore and it is depleting each passing day
965496 rise in population is the prime factor to blamed for it in 1991 the population of delhi was merely eight million today it has crossed 17 million but at the same time the number of policemen has not gone up accordingly
965497 the factor to be blamed is more money transactions rise in wealth has also led to more crimes in the city and most of our officers time goes in investigating these cases
965498 the current strength of 60 000 is not sufficient keeping future challenges in mind we had requested the home ministry to sanction additional strength of 10 000 to 15 000 policemen but the file is just gathering dust
965499 most of it s due to a benefactor in new york city a tai chi master named don ahn about 20 years ago i saw footage of people doing that stuff in the park
965500 it was never anticipated that the permanent supportive housing program was going to take responsibility for all of femas disabled clients
965501 when we put this together we did not anticipate how much homelessness was going to explode we had always been hoping that fema was going to continue to support these people instead of just dumping them on us
965502 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
965503 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
965504 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
965505 then the argument will be made that a sitting president cannot be liable that he should not be liable for a trial or subjected to a trial because it will bring the country into disrepute
965506 the visit has helped in reducing tension and dispelling many apprehensions and misunderstandings with afghanistan
965507 if you take one step forward we will take 1 000 steps
965508 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
965509 well versed in setting aside raw emotion in determining fact
965510 the tawafiq front is not happy or satisfied about these negotiations because they did not reach an agreement
965511 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
965512 baseball is cubas national sport and cuba is the reigning olympic champion so we must do it again this time
965513 but these olympic games are going to be the most difficult ones from a historic standpoint with so many strong teams in competition
965514 i feel a great responsibility on my shoulders but we have made many sacrifices in order to reach that goal
965515 they had learned how to eat the spicy korean food with chopsticks the way it is done in eastern asia
965516 i am not worried about that we do not force anybody to do anything everyone thinks and acts according to their own will
965517 este blog pretende ser un escaparate de propuestas materiales y recursos educativos un lugar donde encontrar ingredientes para cocinar nuestro trabajo y tambi n un lugar donde exponer ideas experiencias y comentarios de nuestros visitantes espero que nuestra despensa haga m s f cil la tarea de cocinar con esmero y tambi n que no falte nunca ning n ingrediente para hacerlo

965520 you have our permission to turn off the tv and go to bed now as long as you promise to patronize our sponsors
965521 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
965522 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
965523 it was under a rock we got two of them
965524 typically the candidates cabin is like business class roomier and less chaotic than the staff and press areas but still short of the accoutrements of a pro teams charter

965530 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back concerning all acts of iniative and creation there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you can do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now

965536 it happened when i was on stage in the middle of rang barse the power to the sound went off no mike no electronics from the keyboard nothing it was a nightmare situation for any performer and any concert
965537 in a flash realising the situation the percussionists and the drummers who needed no power kept the beat going on
965538 after realising that the power had gone and that we were keeping the action going on stage the audience stood up and joined in to clapping and dancing
965539 they had realised our predicament but just overlooked it and joined in a great gesture of togetherness in keeping the show going on
965540 the failure of the doha talks celso amorim brazils foreign minister says will have dire consequences including the death of more people from starvation and the destabilising of more governments by runaway inflation
965541 such dangers are more likely to affect poor countries than the rich nations especially in the us and europe whose farm subsidies and import tariffs mr amorim and his colleagues from the g20 group of developing nations had hoped the doha round would dismantle
965542 so it is especially frustrating for mr amorim that the collapse of the talks was caused by indias refusal to give ground on measures to protect its non farm sectors and by unwillingness by china and even argentina brazils main partner in the mercosur customs union to join brazil in making similar concessions in the name of a multilateral agreement
965543 a real fragmentation of world trade with more bilateral agreements more dispute settlement procedures at the wto and especially more protectionism
965544 one immediate consequence of the collapse is that brazil will take action against the us on subsidies to cotton producers and on import tariffs on brazilian ethanol
965545 not having a deal implies there will be pressure for bilateral and regional deals
965546 president george w bush discussed the collapse of world trade talks with brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva on saturday expressing disappointment over the failure and reaffirming his commitment to reaching agreement the white house said
965547 lula who has said he believes the doha round of trade negotiations can still be concluded after elections in the united states and india requested the phone call with bush who was visiting family in kennebunkport maine the white house said
965548 both leaders expressed their disappointment that a breakthrough in the negotiations was not reached this week in geneva particularly given how close trade ministers came to reaching an agreement the white house said of the 10 minute call
965549 president bush and president lula expressed their continuing commitment to reach an agreement in the doha round negotiations and their desire for the united states and brazil to work together in developing a strategy to advance the negotiations
965550 brazil wants to restart collapsed global trade negotiations and believes an agreement can be reached within two months president luiz inacio lula da silva said on saturday i think if we can resolve the problem between india and the united states i think well have an accord it can take a month two months but we need to sign an accord lula told reporters in sao paulo after a ceremony with metalworkers outside the city
965551 after nine days of talking tough at the geneva global trade meeting which ended in collapse
965552 he was congratulated by colleagues at a cabinet meeting for bravely fighting the nations battle
965553 nath has been contesting and winning elections for 28 years in one of the poorest regions of india and has learned how to balance political and economic priorities
965554 during the talks he said he kept a list of trading countries writing down points deemed must haves and cannot accept
965555 at any time i knew exactly how much i could yield to whom he said with a laugh showing his notes
965556 to some indias commerce minister kamal nath emerged this week as the chief spoiler of seven years of intricate wto negotiations
965557 on friday he was feted with a large bouquet of roses by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry ficci which says it represents over 250 000 businesses across the country
965558 he did it took the courage to stick it out said ficci secretary general amit mitra as flash bulbs popped and applause rippled around an auditorium packed with diplomats indian politicians business leaders and journalists
965559 world bank lead economist aaditya mattoo said one of the ironies of the collapse of talks is that the deal if passed would actually have cost indian farmers very little
965560 india would have been required to make virtually no cuts in average applied agricultural tariffs
965561 the heart of the round was about legally locking in liberalization that has already happened the effects on actual policy were limited the big benefit was reducing uncertainty by preventing big reversals of policy he said
965562 the deal ministers left on the table was full of loopholes and loose ends but two economists at the world bank will martin and aaditya mattoo have tried to size up its rough dimensions
965563 the chart shows the proposed cuts in the maximum tariffs countries are allowed to apply averaged across products and including various exemptions
965564 in rich countries for example the farm tariffs actually imposed would have fallen from 15 on average to 11 according to the two economists in india on the other hand the average 59 would not have budged at all set against this are some less tangible but still worthwhile boons by binding tariffs near to the prevailing rate a doha agreement would have stopped policies taking a dramatic turn for the worse south korea for example had farm tariffs averaging just 7 in the 1960s some have since reached triple digits
965565 what about subsidies before the breakdown america had contemplated limiting its trade distorting subsidies to 14 5 billion that limit was far more than it actually spent last year but less than it spent in four of the last seven years when farm prices were lower so according to kimberly elliott of the centre for global development a think tank in washington dc the developing countries had won a modest but not meaningless concession from the worlds most powerful country some also believe america would have offered an ambitious cut in its cotton subsidies which are of particular concern to west african exporters africas spokesman in geneva was as disappointed as anyone by the breakdown of the talks
965566 further the changes would have been bound into wto rules so that tariffs throughout the global economy would be guaranteed at current levels
965567 the deal on the table in geneva would have reformed farm subsidies in the united states and europe so that they no longer squeezed farmers in the developing world it would have ended the 16 year banana wars between latin america and the african caribbean and pacific countries
965568 in working out what went wrong in geneva we need to be clear about a number of things
965569 nor did the geneva talks fail in a general standoff between the developed and developing worlds as happened in cancun in 2003 rather the negotiations faltered in a disagreement on a specific issue in farm trade that divided large agricultural exporters and developing countries with large populations of poor farmers such as india and china developed and developing countries alike worked hard to reconcile the extremes and save the deal the issue was a safeguard clause that would have governed how fast commodity exports from big exporters could rise from year to year one side insisted they would not accept any formula that did not let them protect small farmers especially from subsidised exports from the united states in turn the us complained that the measure effectively meant new restrictions on us exports of soy and cotton
965570 any new attempt to grasp the grail of a world trade pact will probably have to wait until next year after elections in the united states and india despite some calls for more talks now economists say
965571 and a senior wto official told afp it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
965572 the idea is to continue to advance to be able to present a package all tied up to the new us administration and to india after the us presidential elections he said
965573 on the surface the immediate cause of death for the trade deal that expired last week would seem to be blunt force trauma inflicted by india whose government could not abide further opening of agricultural markets
965574 but to charlene barshefsky the united states trade representative in the clinton administration there was something else as well
965575 ms barshefsky favors a very different approach the signing up of a limited number of big players in deals that are specific to the most important industries
965576 the collapse of the wto doha round trade talks implications and future options with a keynote presentation by ustr general counsel warren h maruyama
965577 europes unease about genetically modified crops is threatening to create continent wide shortages of soybeans a crucial source of protein in the diet of europes livestock
965578 the european unions strict regulations on genetically modified crops could prevent the import of millions of metric tons of new biotech soybeans likely to be planted in the u s argentina and brazil the worlds main soybean growers
965579 eu livestock farmers might not be able to get enough soybean for feed in the coming years because exporters wont ship to europe for fear that their cargos could contain unapproved biotech soybeans in the normal course of production and shipping a similar obstacle exists for many corn imports but unlike soybeans the eu can grow plenty of corn within its borders
965580 farmers across the world already have been hit hard by rising fuel and feed prices in europe a shortage driven rise in soybean prices would likely spill over into meat prices particularly of pork and chicken prompting steep declines in their consumption and production
965581 the european commission the eus executive arm is debating how to respond with one possibility being permitting trace amounts of unapproved biotech crops in imports
965582 an analysis published in 2007 by the commission found that under a worst case scenario an interruption of soybean imports from the u s brazil and argentina european pork production would fall 34 7 in 2010 and poultry production would fall 43 9

965802 the more relevant bloggers become in terms of audience and influence the more their production routines resemble those of professional journalists
965803 more than one blogger said a key turning point in the way they practice blogging was the moment they felt the gaze of the public eye realizing that people are paying attention has led these bloggers to adopt a more careful dispassionate approach and tone
965804 has led to less opinionating and more reporting and thoughtful analysis
965805 i was more creative when i started now im more deliberate i started trying to be more professional once i got to 100 readers i started to get more organized and started to take more responsibility for what i posted then i started to restrict what i put up there ive ducked a couple of issues recently because i wanted to be better informed i didnt want to be wrong so i just avoided the topic
965806 ive written about a candidate and said simply that the candidate has been in office too long and should go i know more and there are rumours i could check out but i chose just to say that about being there too long
965807 whereas constraints necessitate routines so does a lack of limits bloggers have developed routine practices that narrow down possibilities
965808 like journalists do not meet or converse with most of their readers directly
965809 not unlike the beat routine in journalism which ensures a steady predictable stream of stories

965842 theres something great about playing these old games in their original cabinets something that emulation and home gaming consoles have never been able to fully capture
965843 unfortunately buying your first arcade machine can be a daunting task and over the past decade and a half ive done just about everything you can do the wrong way my goal with invading spaces is to educate people about the hobby and help them to avoid making the same mistakes i made

965871 the position of the west as characterized by the use on the part of the united states britain and the european union of sanctions as a weapon of pressure or blackmail to ensure that an outcome which is according to their own definition prevails is of great concern to us

965883 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
965884 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
965885 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
965886 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
965887 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

965945 if it is up to me we are going to explain that an attack on this homeland of that nature would be followed by an attack on the holy sites in mecca and medina because that is the only thing i can think of that might deter somebody from doing what they would otherwise do but as i say if i am wrong fine i would be happy to do something else but you had better find a deterrent or you will find an attack there is no other way around it there have got to be negative consequences for the actions they take thats the most negative i can think of

965988 there is no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
965989 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
965990 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
965991 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
965992 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
965993 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
965994 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
965995 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
965996 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
965997 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
965998 if humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy he would not be born to die since his body is doomed to die his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature it cannot be unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life it cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most out of them it has to be the fulfillment of a permanent earnest duty so that ones life journey may become an experience of moral growth so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it

966011 i am obsessed with marketing in general cause marketing especially because it allows creativity and money making like typical marketing but is also socially responsible for a heart string cause to love something so much and make a difference in hundreds of thousands of peoples lives especially that of children is amazing
966012 right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
966013 what does the right of resistance mean it means the right to hold weapons in the south it means the right to move weapons across the syrian border and all around the country it means the right to operate a private telecommunications network this makes hizbollah a state within a state
966014 my little boy was recently given this gift of what appeared to be a tambourine on closer inspection it appears to be sponsored by sega obviously still reeling financially from the arsenal disaster the console for the masses should not be associated with drunken southern proles sega has chosen to begin the marketing push for what can only be dreamcast 3 by targeting the under twos this gives them 12 years of development time before their target audience reaches prime video games playing wanking age

966020 barack obama directly intervened in last decembers presidential election in kenya supporting fellow luo tribesman raila odingas candidacy according to an explosive new book written by wnd senior staff reporter jerome r corsi when obama decided to support odinga corsi noted obama embraced the extreme left wing of kenyan politics going back to raila odingas father odinga odinga known as double o who was overtly communistic during the presidency of jomo kenyatta odingas current party the orange democratic party or odm is a leftist socialist political party that stops short of being openly communist
966021 in formulating his iraq policy sen obama seems to value ideological consistency above military victory
966022 by detaching his policy from any future factual analysis sen obama would create a dangerous situation in which he would be obligated to reduce the u s presence in iraq even as those reductions were endangering u s forces and allies in the region as well as the government and people of iraq

966025 yeah um sorry for invading your country blowing everything up killing your leader but im afraid your insurance doesnt cover morons blowing the fuck out of everything
966026 when i look back on my college days maybe it was a different era in the late 60s but most of my fraternity brothers didnt have criminal records not yet most of them even those who were in rotc and hunters but the behaviors they exhibited werent the kind of behaviors that gave me confidence that packing guns in their lockers or in their rooms would make me safer
966027 allowing handguns does provide extra protection and extra deterrent against crime
966028 its not a one stop solution but provides a deterrent and i feel very comfortable with people who have fulfilled their requirement to be able to carry
966029 the media likes to paint us as paranoid about mass shootings on campus
966030 what we are more concerned about are the types of crimes that happen on a daily basis on our campuses across the country these crimes are rape assault robberies these are things we should be able to protect ourselves against
966031 rather than creating safe zones for victims we may unintentionally be creating safe zones for criminals who are doing the attacks and who have less to worry about
966032 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
966033 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
966034 if anyone brought a gun to class id be scared out of my mind regardless if they are trying to stop someone who is shooting someone or not
966035 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
966036 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood
966037 displayed a callous cruel and cavalier attitude toward the two girls that he had raped and helped to murder surely no juror or judge will ever forget his words or his sordid deeds
966038 im where i am because i made an adolescent choice thats it
966039 my life is in black and white like old western movies
966040 but unlike the movies the good guys dont always finish first
966041 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it
966042 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top
966043 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
966044 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions
966045 my life is in black and white like old western movies

966144 edenors selection of oracle utilities applications is testimony to the strength and value we offer the industry we look forward to teaming with edenor to help the company navigate the demands of a complex regulatory environment while delivering superior customer experiences

966150 the umkhonto we sizwe military veterans associations mkmva threat of revolutionary violence should jacob zuma be found guilty of corruption makes his candidacy as president of south africa untenable
966151 zuma must now put the public interest first and announce his withdrawal from the presidential race until his corruption trial is resolved
966152 the discourse surrounding zumas trial has shifted rapidly from the menacing rhetoric perpetrated by anc youth league president julius malema and others to an all out declaration of war by former soldiers
966153 this is effectively a promise of a military coup if the courts find against zuma
966154 as such he is not fit to lead south africa
966155 the public interest will not be served by a deal or a so called political solution that gets zuma off the hook
966156 it will be served by removing him as a candidate for the presidency of south africa

966363 while producing organic growth in our core businesses we worked toward the implementation of several long term growth initiatives scheduled to take effect during the third quarter we have spent the last year preparing for both the transition of our energy clearing to ice clear europe and the commencement of exclusive trading of u s russell index futures at ice futures u s we also expect to complete our acquisition of creditex later this quarter and are already collaborating with the creditex team on innovative initiatives to serve the global credit default swap markets we continue to invest in new avenues of growth and to evaluate m amp a opportunities to expand our position as one of the most global diversified derivatives markets in the world
966364 the fundamentals of our business remain solid particularly given the increased need for risk management across futures and otc markets
966365 weve continued to grow our business substantially while generating synergies in our u s futures business and producing operating margins that reflect our disciplined approach to growth this consistently strong performance provides us with the balance sheet and cash flows necessary to execute the share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors even as we continue to invest for future growth this program reflects our belief that the current share price does not appropriately reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our global business in compliance with sec rules we will begin the repurchase of shares after the creditex acquisition closes

966378 these top line results with boceprevir are very exciting especially given that genotype 1 is the most common and hardest to treat form of hepatitis c
966379 boceprevir was well tolerated by patients in this study including those who received 48 weeks of boceprevir in the longer duration treatment arms
966380 these top line results further validate this novel treatment paradigm and the design of our pivotal phase iii studies of boceprevir one in treatment naive patients and one in patients who had failed prior treatment in which all patients will receive 4 weeks of pegintron and rebetol prior to the addition of boceprevir
966381 additionally this strategy has the potential to reduce the likelihood of the development of resistance by identifying patients who are responders to interferon and ribavirin prior to their receiving a protease inhibitor

966400 die zucht von black tiger garnelen ist im vergangenen jahr in asien zusammengebrochen da virusepidemien die krankheitsanf lligen tiere dahingerafft haben
966401 jene garnelen die nicht eingingen blieben klein und erreichten nur 20 gramm
966402 diese ist nicht in den asiatischen mangrovenw ldern beheimatet sondern stammt aus s damerika und bedroht damit die artenvielfalt
966403 der erste schritt ist der aufbau einer population von gesunden muttertieren die stark und daher auch resistenter gegen allf llige infektionen und die vor allem ohne die weit verbreiteten krankheitserreger sind
966404 solche bio garnelen nutzen die nat rliche umgebung in den mangroven um zu wachsen das bedeutet auch dass der garnelenfarmer auch darauf zu achten hat dass die mangroven gesund bleiben und etwa die tiere vor zuviel sonnenlicht gesch tzt werden

966417 our second quarter 2008 operating results reflects the strongest second quarter performance since 2001 achieved through incremental revenues and the results of our continued focus on cost control and process improvement this performance builds on the excellent start we had to the year
966418 our consolidated revenues before reimbursements improved by over 9 on the strength of our international and u
966419 operating cash flow through the 2008 second quarter showed a 17 4 million improvement over the 2007 period we are driving this company to improve its working capital management and this improvement is a direct result of those efforts
966420 while we are pleased with our results through the first half of the year our outlook for the remainder of 2008 will remain conservative as we continue to implement the operating plans we have outlined in support of the strategic direction of the company for the full year we expect a significant improvement in consolidated operating results over 2007 as we focus on improving our efficiency and maximizing the incremental margins on the sales gains we achieve we are committed to managing our operations toward improved operating performance throughout the year while at the same time continuing to enhance our industry leading quality

966433 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
966434 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them
966435 well give luda a special pardon if im ever in the slammer better yet put him in office make me your vice president
966436 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
966437 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists
966438 the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

966442 it could be structured by cows and we would rate it

966444 youve got to understand that every firm here was throwing people at the ratings process given the money involved but nobody could really ever keep up
966445 the learning curve is steep and the process complex its not something that just anyone could do but astronomical growth far outpaced any firms ability to stay ahead of the business from a staffing perspective
966446 the idea that the agencies actively colluded with issuers misses the point in my opinion
966447 that would assume that we had the time and ability to do so neither of which was often the case we really were turned into order takers and our main concern was to keep deals
966448 essentially not changed in its mission from the repertory of 40 years ago
966449 on two occasions we felt let down when rahul dravid didnt get khel ratna and yuvraj singh was denied arjuna dravid was in good form we had won 16 odis on the trot and the team was on a high still he did not get the award
966450 yuvraj too was unlucky not to get arjuna after two years of consistent performance we are happy dhoni got it

966457 pervasive as to amount to shock treatment for the audience
966458 surprised by todays decision and disappointed for families and parents
966459 i continue to believe that this incident was inappropriate and this only highlights the importance of the supreme courts consideration of our indecency rules this fall
966460 really big first amendment issue is there really any difference between broadcast and cable internet books et cetera
966461 if we apply the same first amendment scrutiny to broadcast as we do to other forms of communication all these broadcast indecency rules are almost certainly unconstitutional
966462 like any agency the fcc may change its policies without judicial second guessing
966463 but it cannot change a well established course of action without supplying notice of and a reasoned explanation for its policy departure
966464 will lead the fcc to return to the policy of restrained indecency enforcement it followed for decades
966465 this is an important win for the entire broadcasting industry because it recognizes that there are rare instances particularly during live programming when it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material despite best efforts
966466 the court agreed with us the fccs inconsistent and unexplained departure from prior decisions leaves artists and journalists confused as to what is and is not permissible
966467 if a striptease during the super bowl in front of 90 million people including millions of children doesnt fit the parameters of broadcast indecency then what does
966468 they are doing their best to make people afraid of us to make people afraid to be anywhere near us
966469 this is an extremely biased description designed to defeat proposition 8
966470 now the democrat elected officials such as attorney general jerry brown are siding with the anti prop 8 campaign and using their power to place every obstacle they can before this crucial proposition despite the unscrupulous tactics of our opposition californians are committed to restoring the definition of marriage and we will certainly reject judicial activism
966471 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
966472 both the summary change and inserting the claim that california will lose millions of dollars if marriage is banned proves that even our supposedly unbiased elected officials have no desire to protect traditional marriage
966473 over 1 million californians signed a petition to place on the ballot a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman
966474 this new biased language does not reflect the protect marriage initiatives intent and is clearly meant to sway voters decisions even in the ballot box
966475 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
966476 i hope this clears the way for mo cheeks and andy reid and those guys now we can win championships in philadelphia i hope that takes care of everything
966477 we just went out there and gave it our all and played total team defense
966478 we wanted to come out and play hard but we made the game closer than what it should have been
966479 there was one black male reporter one black female reporter and one black cameraman at all the stations
966480 edie was the first one who felt it was necessary for you to know who the movers and shakers in town were and quietly introduced you to them and gave you references and all things that were specifically required for a reporter to have early success
966481 it wasnt the norm to see black people on tv back in the 60s she made you proud to watch her she was beautiful and had this poise about her when i got a chance to meet her in person she didnt disappoint at all she was warm and friendly a really good person
966482 she encouraged me to go to school so i went to night school and eventually became a cameraman from edie i learned how to speak right pronounce words correctly because if you didnt shed get after you
966483 when you were on the street with her it was like being out with your mother wed go shopping have lunch theres nobody like her and nobody will ever be like her
966484 she was a gracious and gorgeous woman who loved people and was touched by the stories she did
966485 some people in this business are fake edie was real
966486 i remember thinking this lady really has class shes going to make it in this town
966487 in those days if you were beautiful and successful you had a tendency to look down at others
966488 i never saw any of that in edie she was friendly with children adults the haves and the have nots nothing went to her head
966489 we saw her every day in the building you saw her water the plants on her days off channel 10 was her home shed come in and shed stay for 20 minutes or 20 hours even when she was off
966490 she had not gone out to pasture she could kick it and work and thats what people loved about her
966491 edie was the nicest person she was genuine im devastated i really am
966492 she knew much more about culture and social issues than i do she always stayed current always sought out young people and shared the wisdom and knowledge she had
966493 back then our community had no other place to look for hiv aids information on a regular basis
966494 because the name of the bill contains the word child and the word online many mistakenly think this is about child pornography
966495 the material copa prohibits is any material that anyone in the most conservative community may think is harmful to minors
966496 any communication picture image graphic image file article recording writing or other matter of any kind that is obscene
966497 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find taking the material as a whole and with respect to minors is designed to appeal to or is designed to pander to the prurient interest
966498 lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors
966499 harmful to minors of the prurient interest no one knows what any of those terms mean
966500 what we do know is that there are large segments of the population who believe that any speech about homosex uality or even sexual activity except for abstinence is inappropriate for minors
966501 although some uncertainty may nevertheless exist regarding the precise application of this definition to specific material the supreme court has never held that the first amendment requires absolute certainty regarding what a jury may find obscene or harmful to minors
966502 plaintiffs cite excerpts from the website of plaintiff salon but the majority of the material collected there ranging from articles about sexual experiences to sexual cartoons to images of nude or partially nude prisoners at abu ghraib is plainly not harmful to minors either because it does not appeal to the prurient interest of minors or it has serious value for older minors
966503 our clients do not find it comforting that the government says we could prosecute you under the law but we wont dont worry about it
966504 this is a criminal statute with criminal penalties so if youre the philadelphia gay news and you dont know whats inappropriate under the law and you dont want to go to jail what do you do you start self censoring
966505 we are by our very name an advocacy newspaper fighting for lgbt equality and a community platform
966506 any individual who is sexually active and has the knowledge to understand where to find information that will keep him or her healthy should not be denied that information
966507 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
966508 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
966509 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them

966513 web scripters and content authors who like programming in a visual context
966514 these findings will definitely get people to ask new questions about the formation of the saturn system
966515 the astrobiological potential of the saturn system just went up a notch or two
966516 theyre still awfully cold but much warmer than background temperatures of the rest of the surface
966517 this means it has to be even warmer under the surface and raises the possibility of liquid water beneath the exterior
966518 mayor kyle king is above such petty things as overrating his own team
966519 what was essentially a fourth down hail mary heave against auburn

966523 ah saw your op ed in last weeks wsj i learned a lot and thought youd be interested to read as well
966524 while they may not have input as to whether you get an offer more likely than not you will be assigned the same support staff when you come back
966525 they dont have direct input either but if you alienate them throughout the summer they can affect whether you get an offer by what sort of gossip they allow to be spread about you
966526 the inability to finalize to put closure on an event brings depression
966527 what youve got is a bunch of people who arent having active thoughts about the storm
966528 because of the strong feelings theres sort of a tendency to just want to deal with a hurricane when it comes up
966529 these things help to sustain you during times of unpredictability
966530 can just obsess with doing the minutiae but in the end the minutiae doesnt matter
966531 we have to overcome our problems with reliability and with our tyres performance
966532 but for sure reliability is the biggest thing because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end
966533 we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
966534 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that
966535 for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
966536 we obviously cannot say that everything is one hundred percent
966537 we will have to push very hard these next three weeks in the factory in terms of the cars development and reliability but we showed the cars whole potential during the second qualifying session and then in the race what happened at the end is part of the sport but we have to think forward enjoy a bit of a break and prepare our energy for the last seven races
966538 if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little different but they showed some really strong pace
966539 we already knew they were fast im going to make sure i work very hard during the break and that physically i am well prepared for the rest of the season
966540 i think lewis has definitely set himself up for a more intense training programme for the next three weeks by saying that
966541 obviously when a driver is doing well all he wants to do is get in the car and race
966542 theres a physical mental and spiritual aspect to fitness classes for seniors
966543 its good to keep muscles strong and moving these classes also can help seniors improve flexibility coordination and balance
966544 its back to the old saying if you dont use it you lose it
966545 we have quite a few older adults who participate in our programs
966546 id say about 50 percent of our participants are 50 years or older
966547 and we talk about things like heart rate so if a participants heart rate is too high they can just walk or march to lower that rate
966548 there also are modifications so older adults are not pounding on their joints
966549 and the water provides a cushion so there is less impact on the joints
966550 the benefits muscle wise are that you keep your muscles strong
966551 it also helps women especially as far as not getting osteoporosis and keeping their bones strong
966552 keeping fit whether you are walking or riding a bike or participating in a fitness program is very important in terms of maintaining health and fitness

966579 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
966580 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth

966625 cuando llegamos comprobamos que la contenci n de sueldos y la austeridad de medios era la norma de la empresa lo que son buenos s ntomas agreg que hay un debate tico sobre la mesa en torno a la forma que ha sido manejada intervida anteriormente
966626 se est n revisando todos los proyectos de cooperaci n y en los casos de las intervenciones en frica la india bangladesh y filipinas hemos comprobado que siempre se actu correctamente y se invirti donde deb a hacerse
966627 m s que un presunto delito creo que deber a ser tratado como una buena pr ctica que una ong use los medios necesarios incluido constituir empresas para ayudar a las poblaciones necesitadas
966628 no veo como su distinta forma de enfocar la ayuda para la cooperaci n deba ser criminalizada no han entendido que las ong tambi n son empresas de hecho estas empresas en per son conocidas por todas las personas asociadas a la entidad pues aparecen en su revista corporativa
966629 el caso de la profesionalidad y modernidad de intervida que usa m todos empresariales como ejemplo de buena pr ctica y de xito por fin una ong hac a marketing de verdad

966642 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
966643 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
966644 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
966645 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
966646 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes

966654 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
966655 we might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown
966656 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
966657 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle its a problem we need to resolve this conflict is totally unacceptable
966658 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads

966666 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option
966667 we dont want war we want peace but we will not let the second holocaust take place

966670 affect iranian leaders and others individuals of influence as well as the general populace
966671 i cannot answer the question because it was not raised in our dialogue
966672 it was a decision i made on my experience and the information given to me

966674 it was a decision i made on my experience and the information given to me
966675 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
966676 the refiling of the suit has asserted that the bush administration had circumvented the us constitution by authorizing wiretaps
966677 the us treasury departments action against the iiro further undermined american standing in the arab muslim world by continuing what appears to many to be a war on islam
966678 there is unequal enforcement of anti terrorist laws in the us and that this treatment of muslim charities hurts rather than helps the war on terrorism
966679 the amended lawsuit filed today seeks to do that by quoting public statements made by us officials including former attorney general alberto gonzales and fbi director robert mueller
966680 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
966681 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
966682 felt a false sense of security in the united states
966683 because historically there has been less anti semitism than in other countries but there have been incidents neo nazi terrorist attacks arab terrorist attacks jews have to be vigilant
966684 the threat is not from the american people or government
966685 terrorist sleeper cells that want to target jews these people are very dangerous and the fbi issues warnings against them very often
966686 the average american is friendly to jews but were worried about those individuals on the periphery of society
966687 we realized there is a need for this kind of organization and as israeli combat veterans living in the us we have the skills and ability to respond to this
966688 we believe all jews in the us must be legally armed and trained
966689 and towards this goal we hold paramilitary training camps to train and equip jewish american youth
966690 are 100 legal and in compliance with all federal state and local laws
966691 we strongly believe in the constitutional right to bear arms and we express this right to its fullest
966692 well connected with the new york police and fire departments
966693 all members of the law enforcement community to join in our life saving activities
966694 we are all legally armed and carry radios and cellphones
966695 as we need to be constantly ready to respond to any incident
966696 know your rights and learn how every american can and must be legally armed and how to express the second amendment
966697 they took me through underground passages and made me sit in another waiting room for almost 45 minutes a man approached me and called me to another room for interrogation he asked me to sit down and presented himself as moshe
966698 after all my responses he said to me i want to talk to you openly when you return from israel so that you will have an acceptable reputation on the israeli side
966699 i might divorce because i cant stand in front of my wife as a disabled person
966700 the patient knows that refusal to respond to the interrogators questions and demands will ruin his chances to access medical treatment
966701 the states obligations are derived among other things from the rules of war and from the scope of its control over border crossings between it and the gaza strip

966707 analyzed people who are on at least one social network and in which there exists age information on these individuals
966708 hey ive got insert girl name how good am i
966709 hi im big boy see my crazy overalls and my crazy ass swirly hairdo see how that hamburger im about to cram in my mouth is larger than my head thats pretty fucking crazy im so damn crazy that i have my name on my shirt just in case things get crazy
966710 when deadline couriers gives you a time they actually mean it
966711 i have to say that we are very sad for felipe
966712 because in my view he drove the best race of his career today it was fantastic the way that he attacked when he had to attack and he managed the race right up to the final laps so we are very disappointed
966713 if you are mentally able to manage this kind of race after such a big disappointment you have you take a step forward because you get stronger this is what we are all going to do together because thats the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
966714 we prepared the race last night considering that we knew that in these conditions the two effects were relevant we tried to simulate the start in terms of lines because we knew that if we were in front we could set a good pace for the first stint of the race we were building and informing felipe of the gap behind him to hamilton just to create our race expecting him to be i would say in the region of our pit stop maybe one two laps more one two laps less so we were working around that strategy we were building up our lead considering that situation but to be honest you never know how its going to work out up to the moment that you stop
966715 zero unfortunately we had no warning we just had the smoke in front of us and it was very bad unfortunately there was no signal no information no warning on the telemetry
966716 at the end we told him to take it easy because we felt that we had a mechanical problem at the rear of the car so we didnt want to take any risks we wanted him to bring the car home after what we saw unfortunately with felipe on the same lap
966717 we saw there was something on the mechanical side on the rear that was not properly working
966718 not only these two points but for sure reliability because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometers from the end we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it
966719 and on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side massa we were able to jump in front and do our own race as we were able to do and on the hand raikkonen spending the first part of the race in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
966720 what we need to improve looking ahead to the next grand prix is our situation in tricky conditions which may be in terms of temperature in terms of situation weather something like that for sure we maybe need to prepare our cars and tyre set up in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
966721 it was many years ago me and my bruders had been playing by the sea we were but wee things then my father had been catching fish that day and pulled her up in it seems she ate all the fish in the net almost ate through the net itself in fact

966731 dewey take your brothers and sisters into the kitchen and find some lunch

966733 i wonder why that lady would do that to me

966756 i must say you are a tricky one but i did it finally finally finally and ill make sure the job is finished this time
966757 i started thinking that perhaps you were a witch you know but then i was like hell no its just some kind of stupid dumb luck because you dont know the first thing about being a real witch just a real bitch
966758 sure that backstabbing gardener tried to tell me you were dead but then your poor concerned uncle called me he didnt want me to worry about you
966759 he is just so cute and happy all the time
966760 that would be my own special batch of apple poison working its way into your blood stream not enough to kill you unless you ate that whole thing but enough so i can
966761 you you are the last thing of hers to get out of my house i would have done it years before but im not a child killer
966762 well not on purpose just another pitfall you managed to avoid somehow your father just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time but your lives are over pussy cat

966789 and she put the slivers of glass in the milk and im really suspicious about those snakes in your closet it has become a death trap for all of us just yesterday poor maria got a nasty cut
966790 the staff had a meeting just a while ago we were thinking that maybe it might be best if you didnt call the police about all this you see a few of us have some legal issues we were thinking that it might be best if i convinced her that you were dead we dont mean to be so stingy its just that we all have our families to support you understand
966791 to prove i completed my mission mrs summer asked for your heart would you mind giving me your necklace
966792 ill tell her that the necklace was in my way when i tried to cut your heart out

966811 would you mind if i stay with you guys for a while i can cook help with the kids clean up a little
966812 you know you can stay here without doing all of that stuff but i must say the cooking part does sound enticing
966813 i mean i already told her and she said maybe it would be best
966814 well all right we dont have to call anyone right now oh my gwen you look like youre freezing you have to wear a sweater when you come out here come on lets get you out of the cold
966815 howdy young man just home from the war are ya
966816 yeah just got back i had to bus it all the way from new york city
966817 you dont say new york city well i guess youve seen a piece of the world now havent you
966818 i think i saw you a time or two on the battlefield in stalingrad
966819 stalingrad new york france germany yeah you could say ive been around
966820 so you called me out and now im calling you out soldier
966821 we got no further business for the time being im heading home to see my family and get back to living ive seen enough dying for one lifetime
966822 but i say let bygones be bygones in fact id even say you deserved a reward for all your hard time over there
966823 its just something down the road a piece only i cant get to it but whoever is willing enough could sure make themselves rich for just a few minutes of toil might as well be you as i say you deserve it
966824 is get down inside this old hollow tree stump just off the road inside youll find it goes underground a ways into a natural cavern not too deep mind you
966825 and down there youll find all the copper silver and gold coins you ever needed theys just sitting in chests down there waiting to be had
966826 like i say i cant get to it you have to lower somebody else down into the hollow stump with a rope and haul em back out again its a two man job
966827 nobody yet the most people ive met are too scared to go down in that cave and even if they werent when i tell them that theres three dogs down there guarding the chests well then they just dont see it likely
966828 except they aint brave soldiers like yourself and they dont hear me out and best of all ive got this special quilt if you spread this quilt out on the floor in front of the dogs they will just curl up on it like newborn pups they wont even so much as growl at you well lookee here
966829 so if i went down in there and took care of the dogs and then took my fill of the coins well whats your part of it
966830 i got no use for coins i only want a tinder box that my pappy left behind when he went down in there some years ago
966831 yes sir re a silver plated tinder box its got nothing but flint and steel in it not much different than one you mightve used to start a fire in stalingrad its just a sentimental thing to me
966832 so all i need to do is bring you the tinder box and im on my way with whatever coins i can carry
966833 now you listen good soldier boy the cave is lit up with candles so you should be able to see what youre doing look for three wooden doors behind the first youll find an old blue tick coon hound hes a big one and his eyes are as dark as the spots on his back hell be sitting on a box of copper coins but hell pay you no mind just spread this quilt out on the ground and then go lift him off that box and put him on the quilt then you can help yourself to whatever coppers you can carry in the next room youll find a fox hound on a box of silver hes a walker and hes even bigger than the coon hound but his eyes are red as fox hair dont let him spook you none just do the same with the quilt and youll be fine
966834 in the third room youll find a golden retriever sitting on a box of gold now hes a fright that one and i aint kidding dont look at his eyes if you can help it they swirl like the dark pools of water hes trod through to bring wild game back to his master now i dont know as you can lift him but spread that quilt out all the same and do what you can if you want any of that gold
966835 how do i know youll keep your word and pull me back out
966836 well i wont pull you back out if you dont get that tinder box
966837 i was just making sure you hadnt forgot all right scratch you hold onto that line
966838 you dont mind if i help you down off that chest do you
966839 im just here to make a little withdrawal if you dont mind
966840 thank you mr walker i hope the foxes are plenty wherever you hunt
966841 and i hope youll do none to me im only here to take some of the coins youre sitting on and in exchange you can rest yourself on this beautiful quilt
966842 thank you for a fortune master retriever ill see it gets spent well and goes to a greater good
966843 tell me one thing what do you plan to do with it
966844 why i already told you it belonged to my pappy and i just want it back besides what i do with it is no business of yours
966845 yeah i called you for a devil all right but you called me wrong scratch i aint no soldier and i never carried a gun my outfit was the army chaplain corps and those cold nights in stalingrad i spent them chasing you off the sick and the dying
966846 ive been an ordained baptist minister since i was eighteen
966847 i never did your dirty work over there and i wasnt about to do your bidding here so i guess you figured on the wrong man old snake now you think on that while you rot in that stump
966848 so now you know the secret of the tinder box
966849 and now youll know one more you can only fool the devil but once
966850 lets get out of here before that crazy woman gets back
966851 we were joking i dont really want to do this
966852 theres no law against it the walls just there for our protection you know so no one will wander into their territory by mistake well be going on purpose no law against it
966853 look just dont step in the water and youll be fine
966854 no but my cousin heart said he did he said one of his friends went in the water on a dare and changed right before his eyes the sea took him and he never saw him again but i dont believe it
966855 i hope youll be all right but i have to go
966856 ill tell you all about my wonderful time at the dance in the morning
966857 anyone shes alive and she needs help shes hurt but shes alive
966858 i havent had anything to eat in a couple of days
966859 thank you but if you could just help me to the water i can take care of that myself
966860 i cant my mom besides im not like you it wasnt true after all i was in the water last night and i didnt change
966861 i was raised like you rumors untruths false history my dear boy you must want to change the sea wants no one who doesnt want to be there see
966862 just like i didnt change just because i sat on dry land i dont want to stay here i love the sea and i want to return you must love the land
966863 how many times have i told you never to go to the beach
966864 those animals are dangerous and the sea lures in unsuspecting respectable landfolk
966865 why because they chose to live in the ocean instead of on land you know they eat clams just like us they talk just like us they hurt they care what really happened to dad
966866 i should have moved us to the compound like the werlys years ago
966867 pack up your stuff youre moving and never coming back so it will never ever get you but i have to wait i have to wait
966868 there is only one way to find out this is your hearts decision
966869 its not by accident that we found ourselves where we are you cant be at peace in your own house when there is trouble in anothers house
966870 pdp in abia state and its leadership have no hands whatsoever in the attack on chief ta orjis convoy at ngwa iyiekwe in ugwanagbor lga which took place on the 22nd of july 2008 at about 8am we heard and read about it in the news media like other nigerians
966871 it is therefore ungodly wicked and mischievous for anyone including the abia state commissioner for information chief ralph egbu to accuse the pdp or what he calls opposition of being the mastermind
966872 tinapa came up as an alternative to dubai to rescue capital flight rather than having nigerians spend scarce foreign exchange in dubai economy the vision of the cross river state was laudable create a dubai here in nigeria so that other people particularly the african continent and the world would come and do business
966873 the creators of tinapa were very serious about reducing restiveness and youth unemployment particularly in the niger delta in the first phase of tinapa about 20 000 jobs are to be provided and on completion 45 000 jobs so you can see that it is not a small project
966874 we have been paying lip service to creating alternative sources of employment to youth and we know that the oil sector employs only 5 of the population and with tinapa being a major tourist investment it would have employed a significant amount of the population of the niger delta this will go a long way in reducing youth restiveness and militancy this is a project that is supposed to grow our economy and we have been leaving it to degenerate into a sad story
966875 the most saddening part is that dubai has stepped ahead of the game they have signed a memorandum of understanding with senegal to get the french west african countries to come and patronise a mini dubai in senegal and they have done the same in ghana
966876 in a year or two from now if tinapa doesnt take off it will be too late for us because there will be a small dubai in ghana and the money nigerians would have spent in tinapa nigeria again unfortunately will become the biggest patrons of the ghanaian version of dubai in a year or two from now the ghanaian version of dubai will be there
966877 when we asked why tinapa was not operating we were told that it is meant to operate as a free trade zone in a free trade zone you dont pay taxes waivers are granted to all manner of goods including and especially the so called banned foreign goods
966878 however in tinapa today this hasnt been the case the fg has not honoured its obligation it refused to issue licences and framework for operational guidelines to tinapa to enforce the free trade zone regulation
966879 as long as the free trade zone regulation is not enforced nobody will be able to sell or buy freely in tinapa and the shop owners have more or less closed people have invested millions and the more pathetic is the fact that a consortium of ten leading banks invested billions in tinapa and the cross river state government is hugely indebted because of the tinapa lot
966880 if tinapa is able to kick off and operate at its full optimum we can keep some of that money home in fact most of that money we can keep home but if we dont then we will lose the investment in tinapa and then we will lose more foreign exchange to ghana and that will be very tragic
966881 already we know that the bedrock of the nigerian economy is oil we are no longer the 6th largest producer we now range between the 11th and 13th i dont think we will be doing ourselves any service to allow tinapa to lie to waste
966882 simply because already about 450 million has been invested in tinapa
966883 jose was a devoted muslim leader who stood very strongly for the unity of the country and promoted decency in every sphere of life
966884 he was also a true patriot what was remarkable about him is the way he mentored the young especially in journalism
966885 jose was an outstanding leader in journalism he set standards in professional journalism which would be difficult for anybody to match
966886 he so much cherished character that he would say of somebody who did not do well that fellow has no character
966887 jose was an octopus both in nigerian journalism and in global journalism in his death nigeria has lost a great son
966888 what was most important to him was his name and character
966889 all journalists should learn to work very hard like him we have learnt from him that with hard work dedication and commitment the sky is the limit for every conscientious journalist
966890 alhaji jose was a doyen of no mean standing he was an erudite journalist an upright man who ensured that journalism was practiced as a tool for social reformation and development he gave his all to the profession and was instrumental to the robust role journalism is now playing in our national life it is noteworthy that even after his retirement alhaji jose maintained his love and dedication to journalism by mentoring others and chairing the nigeria media merit award initiative
966891 i am pleased to announce that my ministry is about to secure a grant of over five million us dollars from the islamic development bank to support our efforts at wealth creation and poverty reduction amongst women at the grassroots level as a way of contributing to the success of the seven point agenda of mr president as well as the women empowerment targets of the mdgs
966892 we have finalised the modalities to enable women from the funding window titled
966893 akunyili is a great woman who has done the nation proud both at home and at the international level through her accomplishments i want to convey the federal governments sincere appreciation and commendation to you government is happy with what you are doing
966894 every segment of the society students market women traders professional organisations like the nba nigeria bar association nma nigeria medical association and indeed everybody should rise and support the passage of foi bill in the overall interest of the society
966895 towards effective campus journalism told the students that if there is a law guaranteeing every nigerian access to information there would be accountability at every level of governance including the university system
966896 the country cannot afford to phase these education institutions from our education system in its stride for rapid development
966897 many countries in europe and indeed the u s that have made similar errors of judgment in the past are regretting their action
966898 these countries are now practically importing nurses laboratory attendants and technicians from developing nations with better remunerations and in some instances over and above what is paid to the professionals
966899 many graduates of other disciplines in the advanced countries are enrolling in nursing and technical schools in order to raise their economic status what a paradox
966900 but i hope that above all this judgment will usher the much needed unity in enugu state it is only in unity that our dear state can develop
966901 this is no time to seek pound of flesh or bear grudges against political foes whether real of imagine
966902 we have a lot of confidence and conviction in wrapa our confidence was confirmed when our former prime minister was in nigeria he visited nigeria to show his support for female politicians and noticed what wrapa has done for women it is our strong intention to continue our partnership with wrapa beyond the four years because the issues involved are way past four years
966903 it suits the dutch foreign policy well to support the course of women the mdgs targets are very important in the netherlands
966904 i have nothing against journalism i wanted to be a businessman and a journalist i cant run away from it today by virtue of being the publisher of telecoms news weekly and its sister publication a monthly i am still a journalist i have been a publisher for five years the nigerian telecomm news is the only consistent publication that has come to be respected it is the only platform pushing a newspaper and a magazine in a specialised format
966905 we started logica in 2000 and that is the time the gsm revolution came to nigeria many of briefs we had then as an advertising agency were gsm related we wrote advertising copies on them did creative work and designed the adverts on these gsm products nobody really knew what it was about we were all learning i read every information available on the subject there is hardly anybody in the sector today that i dont know we all started together i understand the business to the extent that i know that there are compartments i am contributing from a pedestal that i know very well without what we are doing on the publishing side these companies are hidden our newspaper is known and respected all over the world telecoms requires specialised reporting i go to telecoms events all over the world i meet colleagues and by the grace of god i am well known all over the world as a stakeholder in telecoms
966906 is leaving the school at the end of the year
966907 we have already known that there are other joints that require replacement
966908 the railings also are vital on the bridge those are the furniture on the bridge which protects motorists from diving into the lagoon in case of accident and also it provides safety to pedestrians however we are going to make sure that at the end of the job the surfacing of some sections of the bridge together with replacement of the railings will be done
966909 motorists moving to adekunle edge and can find their way to ebute metta and subsequently disperse into lagos island others can use oworoshonki and find their way to anthony and use the funsho williams avenue or use the herbert macaulay way into ebute metta
966910 apapa oshodi express is another way and then down to ijora
966911 if you talk about italy which i know there is a specialised section within the ministry that takes care of the maintenance of the joints the joints are vital parts that will ensure the longevity of the bridges but we would like to appeal to the people of lagos to bear with us and be patient with the diversion and look out for the signs
966912 we have already known that there are other joints that require replacement
966913 the railings also are vital on the bridge those are the furniture on the bridge which protects motorists from diving into the lagoon in case of accident and also it provides safety to pedestrians however we are going to make sure that at the end of the job the surfacing of some sections of the bridge together with replacement of the railings will be done
966914 motorists moving to adekunle edge and can find their way to ebute metta and subsequently disperse into lagos island others can use oworoshonki and find their way to anthony and use the funsho williams avenue or use the herbert macaulay way into ebute metta
966915 apapa oshodi express is another way and then down to ijora
966916 all i do is a lot of walking i walk a lot whenever i have the opportunity but i could not walk in sokoto they will say ah look at this man hes getting mad what is he walking around for but here in abuja sometimes i walk up and down so im grateful to god for my health
966917 i am retired but not tired its gods own blessing you cant buy health only god can give you health and ive enjoyed excellent health throughout my life i hope it will continue like this im 71 now and i thank god my conscience is clear i will forever do what i believe is right and say what is right
966918 allah didnt make it so and ive never throughout my life prayed to god to make me a sultan of sokoto
966919 when maccido died this very sultan sultan abubakar my father asked me to take him and get him enrolled into the military i personally drove him to kaduna and enrolled him thats how he got into the military so when they announced him i said well hes my own younger brother at least he knows the role i have played in his life so i have no complaints i always fought for maccido because of what his father did for me i was very close to the father and we traveled all over the world together he would not travel without me so i supported maccido and i will support the sultan through thick and thin im very happy and always pray to god to please guide me and do what is right for me and he has and ive no complaints
966920 in 1976 you were appointed caretaker committee chairman for wurno local government how did the experience shape your outlook of public service
966921 i was very close to him i was always traveling with him learning from him and i was very good in school ahmadu bello the late sardauna of sokoto took particular interest in me because i was doing very well in school so i grew up in between the two of them sultan abubakar and ahmadu bello both of them disciplinarians people that believed in hard work and service to humanity that was my initial school whatever position i gained later i benefited a lot out of that pupilage that i had under sultan abubakar and sir ahmadu bello so i didnt find it difficult to be chairman of wurno local government
966922 there is nothing abnormal about being district head what is very important is that as district head i was given the responsibility to look after a particular district of course i knew wurno very well that is the seat of the caliphate of sultan mohammed bello the sultan of sokoto founded wurno first lived there and ruled the caliphate from there before he moved to sokoto to accommodate his own father usman dan fodio so wurno actually is the headquarters of sokoto caliphate it was only when the british took over that they insisted that the seat would be permanently in sokoto but it would alternate between wurno and sokoto i had known the people and they had known me for years even before i became their district head but what is important is that i got nearer to them i saw what their problems were and i did my best to see in what ways i could help them
966923 i established industries in wurno they have raw material clay in wurno and i established brick industry in wurno using local clay which has been there for hundreds of years so i established an industry which gave them employment opportunities later on i also established bottling company that was making soft drinks in wurno for my own factory again that gave them opportunity to get some work to do and to learn something im very proud of that i established two industries the brick industry and the bottling plant which gave them employment and made me happy i was also instrumental to establishing a college of education there in wurno these three i think are enough
966924 this is what i learnt from sir ahmadu bello and sultan abubakar who brought me up they were always of service to people its unbelievable they never thought of themselves but only about their people all the time to the extent that sultan abubakar and ahmadu bello would know people and if they didnt see them for a day or two sometimes they would say look i havent seen so so and so today i havent seen him for some time what is the matter with him go and see what is wrong with him they would know people by name they were dedicated to the people they were not remote from the people they were living with the people so whatever i have been i learnt through that pupilage
966925 again i must be thankful to gen danjuma gen yakubu gowon appointed me to the governing council of the university of nigeria nsukka he appointed me and he appointed danjuma who was then the goc in port harcourt that was how i met danjuma through that association he was the one who appointed me to the constitution drafting committee the so called 49 wise people i was a member so that gave me the opportunity to meet all those other 48 people for them to know me and for me to learn from them so i got exposure through these connections i got to know people and people got to know me they opened so many doors for me for which im ever grateful
966926 what happened was in 1990 i met thabo mbeki in geneva october 1990
966927 i never thought anything about it and i forgot all about it
966928 when mandela was released from prison he came to nigeria to show appreciation to babangida and to nigeria for everything that nigeria had done for them for anc for south africa and other southern countries
966929 we flew from harare to johannesburg to go into namibia but we missed our connecting flight
966930 so when mandela was going to be inaugurated sani abacha said youve been in south africa and you know people lets go
966931 the interesting thing about that one was that we sent request for south africa to accept me as nigerias ambassador there
966932 i had to wait for the relationship to at least improve and so many things going on
966933 anyway in the end when he received me to present my credentials he said look you are the leaders of africa you are our brothers and sisters and we reserve the right when you do anything wrong for us to tell you off
966934 no one will ever be able to play the joker as well as ledger did
966935 the best way to honor the magnificent career of michael jordan and to thank him for what he did for the game of basketball is to shut down the nba after he retired
966936 lance armstrong was so good at being an inspiration to people in his recovery against cancer that no one else should ever try to overcome the disease and inspire others
966937 i bet heath ledger would be an even better joker than pearce just was
966938 no one will ever be able to do it as well as he has
966939 having a new actor come in to a world where everyone would be the same except one character would be more of a distraction than anything
966940 the state now has an ict strategy the first in this country what we have here today is as sophisticated as the ones in advance countries
966941 if not look for the project and join up with us to help us find bugs
966942 what would you say if you had to summarize your life in only six words bookbabie got the idea from a book written by larry smith and rachel fershleiser not quite what i was expecting six word memoirs by famous and obscure it is a compilation based on the story that hemingway once bet ten dollars that he could sum up his life in six words his words were for sale baby shoes never worn
966943 all i ask in return is but one small favor

966964 new hampshire is one of the five seats we expect to win
966965 jeanne shaheen read the press release from chuck schumer she didnt read the legislation and she came out for the wrong bill
966966 have been out of step from where the voters of new hampshire are
966967 its probably the best test out there of a political climate being a republican incumbents worst enemy
966968 he does constituent service he shows up to work he votes he brings home the bacon there are not a lot of inherent things wrong with john sununu except that he is a republican
966969 but with the economy going the way it has been going the last few years nobody in any office looks too good right now
966970 that kind of effective leadership will be contrasted by the media by me by others to the things she failed to do as governor
966971 she raised spending to record levels which i think people have come to expect from liberal democrats
966972 when i am out on the campaign trail talking to people in new hampshire i dont hear people say we need to elect a democrat
966973 what i hear them say is we need to change the direction of this country
966974 whats important is that you cast a vote that is based in principle

966976 when i filled out the application last year it was a very lengthy process it took us the better part of two weeks to get it all straightened out but now that weve applied the first time its basically the same thing every year
966977 it never really sunk in that we could take advantage of it for clarenville days
966978 weve got an epidemic on our hands right now its time for those responsible to take responsibility
966979 how did they get the mink in the farm before it was completed
966980 it was clearly stated at that meeting that the perimeter of the farm would be fenced
966981 i know theyve made an effort to start it but its not fenced were in the middle of summer now and the fence is still not up
966982 my understanding in talking with the department of environment and conservation is that this farm is going to have to live up to the clauses in the permits and licences that they were granted and part of that is to erect the fence
966983 if a mink gets in my yard that owner should be responsible for my vet bills
966984 whether its a farm mink or whether its a wild mink youve got a problem and youve got to fix it
966985 whether the mink are farmed mink or wild mink i dont know and i really dont have a great interest in it but i do have an interest to see that if theres promises made on the mink farm there and the promise was that it would be fenced then we should make sure that happens
966986 no matter what you hold in captivity if you farm fish or if you farm mink or if you farm sheep if you have them in captivity there are going to be escapes
966987 my animals are fenced why cant other people keep their animals in
966988 now when people see mink they automatically associate it with the mink farm because theres a mink farm in the area
966989 we clearly need players but i think weve got to move players out before we can move players in
966990 weve got some very good young players thanks to the academy system coming through but theyre not ready yet
966991 the nonsense notion that its the red wine that protects the french from disease due to their high fat diet
966992 we can go there if you want but this isnt really the place
966993 this group eats lots of animal fats yet remains healthy or regains health how can that be
966994 i know what the data says but theres no way thats healthy

967000 diminish the ability of domestic violence victims to get the protection they need
967001 protective orders are increasingly being used in family law cases to help one side jockey for an advantage in child custody they are almost routinely issued by the court in family law proceedings even when there is relatively meager evidence and usually without notice to the restrained person it is troubling that they appear to be sought more and more frequently for retaliation and litigation purposes
967002 if a parent is willing to abuse the system it is unlikely the trial court could discover his or her improper motives in an order of protection hearing
967003 anybody who practices family law sees people who abuse the restraining order process some create false allegations or take minor or insignificant acts and use them to remove their spouse or partner from the home for advantage in litigation such abuses undermine victims of real abuse and violence who seek protection
967004 the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a
967005 it appears the only people affected by the ban were law abiding citizens like demar who were ensnared by the ordinance for having guns that suddenly became illegal
967006 repealing the ban makes sense because the ordinance was grounded in nonsense
967007 i think the strongest option that would give a clean slate to the whole situation would be to repeal the ordinance
967008 what about cleaning the slate for any otherwise law abiding citizen who was convicted and fined under the provisions of this draconian ordinance
967009 any such persons should have their records cleared and their fines returned
967010 the supreme court has made it clear that outright handgun bans are unconstitutional
967011 wilmettes trustees ought to be congratulated for doing the right thing even though it took them 19 years to do it the solution to violent crime is not passing and enforcing laws that treat honest citizens like criminals
967012 the wilmette ban was largely passed as a symbolic gesture
967013 symbolism never prevented a single crime and one does not make socio political statements at the expense of a fundamental civil right there are other options that make far more sense than disarming the public were glad village officials in wilmette will be exploring those other options and we hope they consult with gun owners in the process
967014 i felt threatened because he she looked mean at me
967015 he resisted arrest when lacking a 5th amendment indictment of probable cause determined by a grand jury
967016 so we see that de jure is of the law and by right thus the rule of law in america is the de jure law dictated by the declaration of independence the constitution for the united states of america and the principles of christianity these were based on state constitutions and all political subdivisions of the state government must comply with these
967017 so what exactly do i eat looking at fitday again
967018 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
967019 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
967020 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
967021 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
967022 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
967023 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
967024 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
967025 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion
967026 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products

967031 the next thing i know i heard a woman saying hes not going to survive not going to survive
967032 i looked through the window but couldnt see anything it was too dark
967033 i heard a row with dogs and people fighting at about a quarter past two i didnt go out to look
967034 they were friendly going down the street then they were arguing among themselves when they came back up it sounded like the same voices they were right under the window
967035 i didnt hear any fighting but there were loud voices
967036 i didnt know anybody had been killed until i stepped out of the door in the morning and saw the police tent
967037 its normally a quit area weve had nothing like this before its a nice little spot really
967038 when you think of a heroin addict you dont think of me
967039 its an economics thing if someone is hooked on oxy and cant afford to pay 80 per pill then they turn to heroin
967040 people say that heroin went away its never gone anywhere
967041 but the user group has changed the old time heroin user was the guy on the street corner now we have kids from the suburbs
967042 the price of oxycontin has doubled in the last year and a half in the milwaukee area people are moving to heroin

967050 the cristal incident was another example of a luxury brand not appreciating the very segment that was largely responsible for the visibility and support of their brand
967051 now you dont see cristal the way you used to
967052 the brands dont say it but where they spend their marketing dollars is very reflective of who they want wearing their things
967053 they will launch the legal machine just to make headaches because they dont want to be associated with britney spears who shaves her head and has a teen sister who has a baby
967054 while they cant say that britneys family isnt allowed to buy their products theyre not happy with the association so they do try to stop it

967059 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
967060 our helicopters are on standby but chances are slim for a rescue operation today it is likely that the italian will now be rescued tomorrow
967061 and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe

967068 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
967069 falsely selling and marketing auction rate securities as safe highly liquid and cash equivalent securities
967070 as the auction rate securities market came under tremendous strain leaving the securities with mounting liquidity risks that eventually blocked thousands of customers across new york and the nation from accessing their holdings

967082 i would like to play tomorrow but i dont know before christmas maybe
967083 we need to go back to the old ea way
967084 they shouldnt use this as an excuse to become even more oppressive if people dont have the space to express the grievances they will be driven to support more extreme means of demonstrating their discontent

967098 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
967099 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
967100 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
967101 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
967102 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
967103 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
967104 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
967105 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
967106 we pat them on the back as hard as we can
967107 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
967108 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
967109 were excited hopefully we ll get some new people in hopefully the people who are here will stay a little longer and were really excited about it hoping to make a little money on the side selling tickets
967110 the cnn special black in america barely scratched the sur face on the issue of racism in america
967111 the root causes of racism and its impact on the lives of black americans is much more complicated and profound
967112 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
967113 absolutely were actually trying to crack a second movie were trying to figure out some ideas for it but yes it would be a prequel
967114 in the prequel its slightly different because its earlier we were three years later so we did a lot of research into the way nature would have sort of overtaken the city with the cracks in the streets and the weeds
967115 the first time you got out there and shut down 6th avenue its like how are we going to do this day after day after day but by the end its just like you know how to do it how to let the traffic through in between set ups and you just sort of get the routine down so thats not the issue
967116 of course i was nervous come on its jet li
967117 we have no idea of what he does how he does it
967118 we are all way more alike than we are different its all about seeing ourselves through each other
967119 ive never had any plastic surgery so doing a character like that it was a lot of fun to change because every scene i have a different nose i have different eyes different hair
967120 we were using a lot of prosthetics so every scene you cant really tell that its me so that was a lot of fun
967121 i read the script and immediately fell in love with it
967122 factors relied on by the district court were clearly erroneous
967123 that a denial of the preliminary relief sought would amount to an abuse of the courts discretion upon reversal of an erroneous finding
967124 it is irrelevant whether this case presents greater issues of claim construction or validity the existence of one or both of these issues is sufficient
967125 in this case the district court did not construe the claims prior to denying the pi request
967126 it is an objective of the invention to provide a device wherein is established a direct gearing i e a gearing by which more transformations of rotational movement to linear movement and linear movement to rotational movement are avoided between the injection button and the piston rod
967127 a court cannot deny a pi that turns solely on a question of law which appears to be the case here by saying that that question of law is just real hard to figure out
967128 the federal circuit should quit the charade or the supremes should step in and finally decide what everyone knows claim construction is a mixed question that usually involves subsidiary factual questions that should be reviewed for clear error
967129 product is the first permitted and fda approved commercial marketing use of the product
967130 because both active ingredients in symbicort have been previously approved for commercial marketing or use before the approval of symbicort applicants approval of symbicort does not qualify as the first permitted commercial marketing or use of either active ingredient as required by section 156 a 5
967131 as a single entity or in combination with another active ingredient
967132 this statutory language requires this court to examine a drug product patents eligibility for extension on a component by component or an ingredient by ingredient basis
967133 an approved product having two active ingredients which are not shown to have a synergistic effect or have pharmacological interaction will not be considered to have a single active ingredient made of the two active ingredients
967134 within the sixty day period beginning on the date the product received fda permission
967135 within the sixty day period beginning on the date the product first received permission
967136 within the sixty day period beginning on the date the product first received permission
967137 so long as we are quibbling it seems to me that the 60th day is not within the sixty day period beginning on the date the product first received permission
967138 astrazeneca points out that the pto has been granting petitions filed on the 60th day at least the 2 or 3 pte petitions of the cases they point to and that i can see on pair were granted despite being filed on the 60th day just as in the case turned down here
967139 was there some benefit to waiting until the 60th day instead of the 59th day would it mean that astrazeneca would have gotten an extra day of patent term if it waited until the 60th
967140 t herefore section 156 d 1 admits of no other meaning than that the sixty day period begins on the fda approval date
967141 try this a work week is five days long and begins on monday whats the last day of the week
967142 whether the pto failed to count correctly in the past is beside the point
967143 they have no choice but to follow the statute as written
967144 its audacious for a state to use the federal courts to sue for patent infringement but to block infringement suits against it as a sovereign that cannot be sued
967145 clarify that states are subject to suit in federal court by any person for infringement of patents
967146 it also provides the perfect opportunity for the court to clarify its jurisprudence on the relationship between congress article i powers and states 11th amendment immunity
967147 maybe congress can fix the 2nd amendment too while theyre at it
967148 well actually you really do need to overrule x case
967149 mr mooney the only thing clear about the denial of cert is that the court has decided not to take the case
967150 how far can this immunity argument be stretched it appears that ca state universities can start selling soda pop under the brand name coke and have no fear of retribution
967151 sovereign immunity is properly a shield against lawsuits challenging a states governmental action not a sword with which to carve out economic advantage over private competitors
967152 the beijing olympics is facing a terrorist threat unsurpassed in olympic history
967153 there has been a tightening of the security apparatus around beijing in recent weeks and in fact recent months and the overlay which the chinese authorities and chinese government has prepared for these games is second to none
967154 at this stage theres no reason to think that the beijing olympic games are any less secure than previous games and in fact they may be the most secure games weve ever seen
967155 if you have to ask how much you cant afford it
967156 if you have to ask how much you cant afford it
967157 the court has never had counsel so recklessly disregard its orders before this trial
967158 t he court had no choice but to instruct the jury that bsc violated the courts orders to put an end to the misconduct
967159 it appears the judge made a decision to make highly prejudicial remarks to a jury for the express purpose of punishing the lawyer
967160 without rules and punishments for breaking teh rules what is justice
967161 the jury is not there to judge the counsels conduct but the facts of the case they present procedure misconduct should be punished by simply halting the improper procedure dismissing an offending attorney if need be but not by influencing the jurys decision out of spite
967162 full command of the english lanaguge is critical in drafting any application
967163 without rules and punishments for breaking the rules what is
967164 a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion
967165 w here two different inconsistent conclusions may reasonably be drawn from evidence in the record an agencys decision to favor one conclusion over the other is the epitome of a decision that must be sustained upon review for substantial evidence
967166 simply because the board chose one conclusion over another plausible alternative
967167 35 usc 145 an applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences in an appeal under section 134 a of this title may unless appeal has been taken to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit have remedy by civil action against the director in the united states district court for the district of columbia if commenced within such time after such decision not less than sixty days as the director appoints the court may adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention as specified in any of his claims involved in the decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law all the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant
967168 there are not many things more challenging than trying to argue an erroneous factual determination where there is substantial evidence to support the finding of fact and to me a trial in a district court avoids this standard of review by lowering the bar to preponderance of the evidence and making the pto argue its position and identification of the phosita
967169 weakness of this reading is that it renders quanta trivial one wonders why the court would take a such a case
967170 scotus said it was conditional ergo exhaustion lesson learned expressly condition the license
967171 scotus said it was unconditional ergo exhaustion lesson learned expressly condition the license
967172 yet the quanta court said nothing to explain how its holding relates to antitrust precedents or section 271 d 5 recognizing that post sale restrictions may be efficient one therefore might try to read quanta as qualifying even its recent antitrust cases
967173 bob kearns had a lot of patience and self restraint
967174 ooh wouldnt it be great if something like this existed
967175 of coure thats why i am trying to change that with my patent reform act
967176 the supreme courts analysis in ksr thus relies on several assumptions about the prior art landscape
967177 easily traversed small and finite number of alternatives might support an inference of obviousness
967178 a prima facie case for obviousness for a chemical compound still in general begins with the reasoned identification of a prior art lead compound
967179 motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound i e a lead compound in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound
967180 the record however shows no discernible reason for a skilled artisan to begin with lansoprazole only to drop the very feature the fluorinated substituent that gave this advantageous property
967181 inequitable conduct in prosecuting a patent application before the united states patent amp trademark office may take the form of an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact a failure to disclose material information or the submission of false material information but in every case this false or misleading material communication or failure to communicate must be coupled with an intent to deceive
967182 what a reasonable examiner would have considered important in deciding whether to allow a patent application
967183 the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive
967184 however the eisai decision cabins in ksrs importance by showing that the assumptions found in ksr do not apply to chemical compound cases
967185 to the extent an art is unpredictable as the chemical arts often are ksrs focus on these
967186 this opinion along with judge raders recent dissent in the aventis case may show a growing split within the court on the issue of inequitable conduct
967187 finally the district court found that tevas theory that eisai deliberately hid the ball from the patent office by separately filing the 552 and 013 prosecutions to be
967188 every respectable murderer knows that you have to throw the receipt away
967189 while rader has been an inequitable conduct dissenter finding inequitable conduct where the trial court did not ought to be fairly difficult for the fc
967190 agreed and for the same reason finding no ic where the trial court did should be even more difficult
967191 of course very narrow picture type claims are only valuable if the actual composition being protected is the only composition that has the desired properties
967192 the record contains no reasons a skilled artisan would have considered modification of lansoprazole by removing the lipophilicity conferring fluorinated substituent as an identifiable predictable solution
967193 it works so well that the posita would not want to modify it
967194 i think you are naive in the extreme about the motives of u s district judges who are busy and typically technically semi literate at best
967195 the supreme courts analysis in ksr thus relies on several assumptions about the prior art landscape
967196 easily traversed small and finite number of alternatives might support an inference of obviousness
967197 obviousness can then based on structural similarity along with some
967198 molecule x and thereby win a monopoly even when molecule x is used as an auto fuel additive doesnt seem right to me you
967199 molecule x and thereby win a monopoly even when molecule x is used as an auto fuel additive doesnt seem right to me you
967200 to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter to be patented
967201 t he possibility of near simultaneous invention by two or more equally talented inventors working independently may or may not be an indication of obviousness when considered in light of all the circumstances
967202 unless someone can provide a convincing precedent otherwise havent found one thats how ill approach this issue that recently arose in my practice
967203 in some instances inventions do not occur after years and years of toiling in a laboratory but rather after a minimal effort executed by others independently and simultaneously after a breakthrough in an enabling technology that is not itself the subject of the invention

967206 t he court relied on the evidence that actual electronics designers used reprogrammable processors in paintball guns during product development before the priority date to conclude there was a motivation to make that combination jmol order slip op at 6 7 therefore on appeal npf next argues that evidence that certain developers used reprogrammable processors during paintball gun development could not properly serve as the basis for a finding of motivation to combine because the use was not sufficiently public to constitute prior art but npfs argument addresses the wrong issue although these uses may not have constituted prior art they nevertheless can be evidence of a motivation to combine see kahn 441 f 3d at 987 88 evidence that those of ordinary skill in the art in fact combined the prior art teachings as claimed is certainly evidence that they were motivated to do so such evidence shows the knowledge of the skilled artisan at the time of the invention which can provide the basis for a motivation to combine see id at 989 evidence that multiple developers of microprocessors for paintball guns used reprogrammable processors shows that it was within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art to use reprogrammable processors during development
967207 the mere fact that someone else thought of it around the same time as the first researcher inherently makes it obvious that seems ridiculous
967208 c laim 10 originally recited matching with an alphabetic character string while one of its dependent claims specified that this string comprised a word
967209 while the board of regents might have been able to distinguish the prior art on this ground the intrinsic record fails to support the argument that it actually did so
967210 each pre programmed code being representative of a syllabic element
967211 matching said binary code with one or more pre programmed codes
967212 this must have been some very valuable technology for ut to waste all the money going after these people with that prosecution history hanging out there for all the world to see did any defendants settle with ut along the way i wonder
967213 with some sophistry the cafc arrived at the result that an infringing vocabulary would only include syllabic elements here the cafc used its grammatical analysis
967214 the cost burdens on industry in the usa of vexatious patent litigation theyre a
967215 uh huh and how many jobs has europe inc created the past decade
967216 im not sure that ut spent much on this case i suspect that the plaintiffs attorney took a bath i dont believe that anyone settled in this case it looked like a winner for the defense from the start
967217 i take that back some parties did settle early most of them very small players
967218 its so hard to explain all this prosecution history business to a judge
967219 because some well known suffixes and prefixes include more than one syllable e g hypo hyper ation phyllic you put those into sounds didnt you this passage compels a construction that allows syllabic elements to be more than one syllable
967220 just because a syllabic element may be a prefix or a suffix does not mean that all prefixes and suffixes are syllabic elements
967221 ill give ya a dime for every prefix or suffix you can list that is not a syllabic element
967222 also i did not know that phillips electronics north america was a small player
967223 back in 2005 there were probably loads of attorneys who were still stuck on the presumption of validity train and who figured oh better to settle e
967224 the concept of patentable subject matter under 101 is not like a nose of wax which may be turned and twisted in any direction white v dunbar 119 u s 47 51
967225 legal consequence of a failure to comply with existing law or regulations
967226 the patent office itself has export control rules that cover export of patent applications these apply only when the technical information has been written into patent application form
967227 has anyone drafted a legal analysis of this issue that they would be willing to share
967228 under the ear any contact between the technology and a foreign national becomes an
967229 sending a disclosure to an ep assoc and instructing them to conduct a search in the epo
967230 ok so multi national company has all us provisionals for project x prepared by attorneys based in their london office project x is based at the us site therefore one would have to contact the bureau of industry and security bis at the department of commerce for the appropriate clearances every time the london site need to draft a patent application
967231 alan then you would be in breach of the export rules not sure what the penalty is
967232 civil penalties 250 000 fine per violation criminal penalties 1 million fine and possible prison time
967233 any useful specific thoughtful commentary on the above would be appreciated
967234 so why does anyone think that having a patent application for an invention developed in the us can be prepared or for that matter filed abroad before securing a foreign filing license
967235 thats quite a bombshell lionel it cant be right can it
967236 or huge multinational law firms with interconnected computer systems any firm partner associate secretary or whatever pc name they go by these days can see files prior to any export license being issued by the uspto
967237 yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd
967238 here comes bream heres the throw to the plate he iiiiiiiisssssssss safe braves win braves win braves win braves win braves win
967239 you have our permission to turn off the tv and go to bed now as long as you promise to patronize our sponsors
967240 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
967241 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
967242 i hope and pray hes sitting on a barstool somewhere with his dad arguing about baseball and his mom and his brother who he misses dearly i hope hes at peace because i know he wasnt the last couple years and he battled and fought and didnt do a whole lot of complaining he knew he wrote some checks that were getting cashed and he didnt complain about it once
967243 you know intellectually that youre exhausted but so what concentrate on the game i know this im not going to embarrass myself if i cant do this ill be the first to know it ive had a hell of a run so ive got nothing to complain about if i die tonight ive had a great life
967244 the bases are loaded again and i wish i was too
967245 ive just kind of grabbed on to the people of atlanta and theyve made me feel at home
967246 i wanted to be judged for my own ability my own style
967247 its like we were on the first wagon train west
967248 we didnt know where we were going but we were having a lot of fun getting there
967249 the people all over the country who send you christmas cards every year the people who when dad passed 5 000 of them sent notes or condolence cards when i lost my brother the people all over the country who sent condolence cards as well how do you thank those people and how do you say goodbye to those people
967250 we dont want to get all maudlin here but thank you folks and god bless you and were going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us
967251 ive got to be able to say ive worked with all of them
967252 i just hope i dont cry to be honest with you
967253 my dad always told me to be honest on the air and to be yourself dont try to be anybody else
967254 while at the uspto my goals have included helping the organization reach a new level of excellence through effective delegation continuous process improvement transparency of operations and increased employee engagement
967255 i am proud of the strides the agency has made and for the first time in the usptos history we are on track to meet 100 of our goals this is a testament to the combined efforts of our more than 9 000 employees such dedication is one of the reasons i believe the uspto is poised for continued success as the worlds leader in ip
967256 margaret peterlin has been instrumental to the success of the uspto over the past year
967257 first her operational leadership and insistence on data driven decision making greatly improved the usptos business operations but margaret also has tremendous understanding of ip issues and helped the administration promote smart ip policies both on capitol hill and with ip offices around the world her dedication to the agency and to the u s intellectual property system has earned her the respect of members of congress ip leaders around the world and her fellow uspto colleagues we thank margaret for her service and commend her on her many achievements
967258 for the first time in the usptos history we are on track to meet 100 of our goals
967259 a bunch of the guys from my firm and i have made a pact to go out and celebrate with some alcoholic beverages the day dudas is gone d
967260 in many ways the negative reaction to peterlin was simply a reflection of frustrations felt by many patent practitioners
967261 her operational leadership and insistence on data driven decision making greatly improved the usptos business operations
967262 a large percentage of newly filed applications are continuations and rces so the uspto should restrict the number of continuations and rces that can be filed
967263 bpai appeals are taking too long so we should strictly limit the number of pages lines words the judges have to read
967264 rogan wanted annual registration fees and annual re examination for all patent agents attorneys not a very popular proposal
967265 btw dear epo examiners long term readers will know that on this blog i am constantly attracting criticism because of my enthusiastic advocacy of the epo nobodys perfect though
967266 thanks lowly theres of course a good local reason for the ridiculous clarity objections and insistence on verbatim support
967267 from the press release and from the lack of news after she was installed she seems to have been a behind the scenes legislative type
967268 i can only hope he will experience some negative blow back which will limit his influence going forward
967269 well could our backlog problem be the result of our production system that encouranges and actually rewards examiners for issuing garbage office actions and endlessly churning old applicaitons in the hopes of getting easy rce counts and bonuses instead of examining new applications
967270 maybe better to file at the epo in french 5 of applications are in french at least then it will get examined by native speakers who will be more confident about allowing entry of non verbatim text
967271 to me however a director could can surround himself herself with staff to make up for any weakness he she may possess
967272 someone really needs to know how things really operate inside and outside to have any chance of making real and effective change
967273 an action under 35 usc 145 is not merely a form of judicial review rather it is a hybrid of an appeal and a trial de novo winner intl royalty corp v wang 202 f 3d 1340 1345 fed cir 2000 citation omitted see also newman 877 f 2d at 1579 a district court action under 35 u s c 145 is a de novo determination of patentability as more fully explained below 145 review affords the applicant an opportunity to present additional evidence mazzari 323 f 3d at 1004 to the extent the applicant presents new evidence challenging particular factual findings the court review the boards factual findings de novo and the court applies the substantial evidence standard to the boards factual findings as to which the applicant presents no new evidence mazzari 323 f 3d at 1005
967274 may not submit for the first time evidence that he was negligent in failing to submit to the patent office
967275 in these circumstances the court finds that takedas failure to submit evidence contained in the declaration is not negligent
967276 w hen a patent applicant seeks direct review of a board decision in the federal district court pursuant to 35 u s c 145 the applicant may present to the court evidence that the applicant did not present to the pto
967277 an applicant denied a patent can seek review either directly in the federal circuit see 35 u
967278 a section 145 review is distinct from a section 141 appeal in that it affords the applicant an opportunity to present additional evidence or argue the previous evidence afresh either by simply relying upon the record below or by reintroducing the same evidence through alternative means such as live testimony
967279 if the parties choose to present additional evidence to the district court as they did here the district court would make de novo factual findings if the evidence is conflicting we then would review the district courts legal conclusions without deference and its de novo factual findings under the traditional court court standard of review clear error zurko 527 u s at 164 n onexpert judicial factfinding calls for the court court standard of review
967280 the plaintiff may not submit for the first time evidence that he was negligent in failing to submit to the patent office
967281 is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion
967282 the only reason why i am interested in the subject in the first place is because the more and more oas cite ksr as supporting 103 rejections without the examiner providing an adequate explanation of how a phosita would find a combination of prior art references to be obvious
967283 b ut if the bpai affirms the 103 rejection the applicant is stuck with the facts of the record and faced with having to argue against a
967284 is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion
967285 i will check with other practitioners who have been facing the same issue of obviousness rejections citing ksr but i would prefer to keep the identity of my clients confidential
967286 expert witness with phd in the art 10 published peer reviewed articles and 20 years experience
967287 more and more oas cite ksr as supporting 103 rejections without the examiner providing an adequate explanation of how a phosita would find a combination of prior art references to be obvious
967288 all the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant
967289 the examiner just finds claim elements in diverse references presumably from word searches and cobbles them together with the benefit of the applications teachings and rejects the claims
967290 so they wind up combining a secondary reference to a sewing invention with a primary reference to a metal bone mending device because both had the word
967291 i have never seen practitioners do the things that you suggest are going on
967292 jim h writes more and more oas cite ksr as supporting 103 rejections without the examiner providing an adequate explanation of how a phosita would find a combination of prior art references to be obvious
967293 i have experienced the same problem the examiner just finds claim elements in diverse references presumably from word searches and cobbles them together with the benefit of the applications teachings and rejects the claims
967294 im not sure what we would really need to get something issued perhaps a full time laboratory churning out data solely to respond to examiners rejections but i dont believe that even that would work because i think the examiners are just looking for some excuse to shoot the claims down perhaps putting in a declaration or some data might put you in a better position for appeal since you can argue the examiner didnt fully consider it but its not getting us anywhere at this point very frustrating
967295 put simply in europe the examiner is your friend but in the uspto your enemy
967296 since the request was only to find an office action
967297 i cant comment on the merits but did the examiner really do anything procedurally improper
967298 since chloride and bromide and well know species of halogen the skilled artisan would have expected chloride and bromide substituted derivatives to work equally well as catalyst components
967299 if your posts were more honest and earnest people would not be so bent out of shape
967300 well ya see norm its like this a herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo and when the herd is hunted it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first this natural selection is good for the herd as a whole because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members in much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells excessive intake of alcohol as we know kills brain cells but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first in this way regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells making the brain a faster and more efficient machine thats why you always feel smarter after a few beers
967301 lowly im thinking that the 103 position in the parallel app at the epo is these days more often soon clear within a few months of the end of the paris year now that the epo is getting its eesrs out soon after the app is filed do you think an applicant at the uspto can get any traction out of an eesr that sees the claims as allowable i have a feeling that uspto management is teaching its examiners epo practices one halogen is reasonably likely to be not so different from another and that uspto exrs are increasingly stealing a look at the epo file online before they issue their faom i wonder whether the positions that uspto exrs take on 103 will gradually get more reasonable with increasing convergence between the uspto and the epo
967302 indeed more than once the cry has been heard max where are you on this one
967303 weve been down this road before apparently it is a violation of some law for an examiner to assert without citation that room temperature water is a liquid at 1 atmosphere and pressure
967304 since chloride and bromide are well know species of halogen the skilled artisan would have expected chloride and bromide substituted derivatives to work equally well as catalyst components
967305 amend its broad claims rather than fight the examiner on bogus procedural grounds that would get it nowhere fast
967306 im guessing you are a litigator working for one of the manufacturers of generic drugs always looking to invalidate what somebody else invented
967307 im guessing you are a litigator working for one of the manufacturers of generic drugs always looking to invalidate what somebody else invented
967308 if you are caving on every rejection you get based upon this type of analysis from the examiner
967309 most high school seniors would also agree that the properties of bromide and chloride are very similar
967310 the latter is not taking the 103 rejection head on in my book
967311 apparently they did take the 103 rejection head on and won
967312 it is not clear with part of the housing of the mobile wireless device is the upper portion and which is the lower portion
967313 a housing having when the mobile wireless device device is in an upright position an upper portion and a lower portion
967314 apparently not what was the argument and evidence pds that they used to overcome the prima facie case
967315 pds you suggest i dont recognise sarcasm when i read it
967316 applicants arguments are found on pages 17 and 18 of the amendment dated december 7 2007
967317 govern the recognition and conduct of agents attorneys or other persons representing applicants or other parties before the office
967318 talk about hubris im not sure the pto is going to have a winning day by simply talking about how
967319 oh edva you just dont understand these rules arent what you say they are they are something completely different cafc please back us up on this
967320 there are many ways to mount an appeal that would have a much different flavor but that would require a slightly different set of facts the problem is the pto is not in a very good position imo
967321 its a great time to turn administrative agency law on its head
967322 t he type of interpretations and deference that the pto is asking for reach far beyond pto operation and could potentially bring pto up to speed with every administrative agency in washington
967323 an application for an invention disclosed in an application previously filed shall have the same effect as though filed on the date of the prior application
967324 every application beyond the second application for an invention disclosed in a previous application shall not have the same effect as though filed on the date of the prior application
967325 in this case the pto has done nothing but try to present a huge laundry list of supposed errors in the district courts approach
967326 still i wonder if the pto cites to lyng v payne 476 u
967327 none of chevron star fruits and skidmore say anything about the ability to turn a statutory positive into a regulatory negative
967328 yes change is coming maybe you will get a real job
967329 i wouldnt be all that surprised to see the pto get rce limits and the okay to pass some type of claim count esd requirement but limits on continuations at a number as small as two and the right to retroactively apply the claim count rules just isnt going to happen at the federal circuit
967330 there is fed cir precedent that applicants have no substantive duty to conduct a prior art search
967331 final rules 75 and 265 are designed to facilitate the offices examination of applications containing a large number of claims by requiring applicants to provide information about the claims and prior art to assist the examiner in determining the patentability of the claims see e g ja57 72 fed reg 46721 final rule 75 permits an applicant to present up to five independent claims and twenty five total claims for examination without providing any specific information about the 10 patentability of the claims
967332 sf thanks do you have the case name or citation handy
967333 and they do have the authority to set their fees
967334 the penalty for not doing so is the loss of allowed subject matter
967335 that is not a penelty you can put all of the
967336 that is not a penelty you can put all of the subject matter in one big claim if you so desire it might be rejected
967337 section 120 was enacted by congress simply to provide a statutory basis for continuation practice not to vest applicants with the right to file an endless stream of continuation applications
967338 section 120 as interpreted in henricksen prevents the pto from crafting its own lmitations to the number of continuation applications that may be filed
967339 should be used sparingly lest statutory provisions be unjustifiably vitiated
967340 do you mean all the limitations in one claim which is of course far narrower than the recitation of 17 individual claims and of course a penalty or do you mean in some sort of markush recitation which the pto is seeking to prevent by other rules and which a jury would find confusing and misunderstand and what if i do not so desire
967341 e6k adults are talking why dont you go upstairs and play with your x box
967342 uspto is the only organization i know that refuses customers openly and tries every effort to see it happen the only reason it has such a mentality and can still survive is that it is a government agency if the pto is a private business entity dudas would have been fired long time ago may be this is the only solution to privatize the uspto
967343 thats because theyre not really customers they are people applying for a government granted legal right to exclude
967344 the role of the uspto is to grant patents for the protection of inventions and to register trademarks it serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products and service identifications
967345 maybe e6k should read what the pto states as their role
967346 unlike the majority of reactionary fundamentalist doofuses on the supreme court i dont think the cafc is interested in alienating itself from most of the civilized people who actually rely on its judgments
967347 did any one else notice the bit about the huge need to limit claims to 25 because the average application used to have 14 4 claims and now omg their is a crisis because the average application has 21 claim how is 21 claims where the basic filing fee covers 20 a surprise or a crisis how does allegedly setting the limit at 25 alleviate the crisis of 21 are they being perhaps disingenuous about setting the limit to 25 do they realize that rule 75 actually sets the limit at 5
967348 if you read the explanation you will see that more claims take longer to examine and this leads to backlog they arent concerned about 20 claims so much as they are with ones that go over 25 this is particularly because the error rate goes up quite a bit for apps with more than 25 claims the office does not want a high error rate on its record nor does it want a high error rate because they know its harmful to the public and the patent owner
967349 as far as i know doll isnt going anywhere for quite some time
967350 wonder if the justice depart told the pto to take the case to the fedcir albeit for non patent reasons
967351 the error rate goes up if there are more than 25 claims
967352 the applicant knows more about their invention that sic anyone else
967353 i would assume that the applicant would thus know how best to claim his invention and how many claims are required
967354 are you saying that the best claims are written by the inventors themselves with no assistance from patent counsel
967355 personally i feel like most people who have a problem with the new rules usually arent the ones that cause the problematic situations but you have to understand that not all practicioners practice like you do and problems do arise as a result of
967356 youll simply have a narrow claim and then a more broad claim and the examiner will infer a limitation from the more narrow one as being inherent implicit in the more broad one when it really isnt and it gets allowed
967357 and what is all this about a time crunch do you mean you are given the same amount of time to prosecute a 5 page 5 claim application as you are a 50 page 100 claim application
967358 my guess is that the current system is enshrined in the examners union contract and they are scared witless to try to renegotiate with the union
967359 well i cant act on it until its on my docket and its somebody elses job to process it and put it on my docket
967360 does anybody e6k perhaps know why the pto adheres so strongly to its current count system and does not providedthe examiners or the applicants the
967361 how many times have you called an examiner about the status of a filing and been told
967362 throwing your fellow examiners under the bus how like you
967363 an examiner inferring limitations into a claim come on now you are really stretching believability ignoring limitations sure but adding them in
967364 how is the retention rate e6k what percentage of examiners who are hired are still at the pto three years later five years ten years
967365 id still catch you near an alley and beat your a ss after your crowd dispersed mr big wedgie man come on down starbucks is just down the corner
967366 obviously an error is an error on the examiners part thats the definition
967367 the guardian has learned that an announcement will be made in the next month to establish a u s interests section in tehran a halfway house to setting up a full embassy
967368 the move will see us diplomats stationed in the country
967369 a remarkable turnaround in policy by president george bush who has pursued a hawkish approach to iran throughout his time in office
967370 this is a criminal act it will make the relations between iraqi citizens and the us forces tense this will negatively affect security improvements
967371 there were two boys victims one was eight and the other was 11
967372 we want to tell the world that those who conduct their foreign policy by using the language of threat against iran have to know that our finger is always on the trigger and we have hundreds and even thousands of missiles ready to be fired against predetermined targets
967373 we will chase the enemies on the ground and in the sky and we are able react strongly to enemys threats in shortest possible time
967374 the war game was aimed at improving the combat readiness of irans armed forces the 2 000 kilometers range shahab 3 missiles were tested to demonstrate irans capability in hitting its enemies accurately at the early stages of their probable attacks against the islamic republic
967375 domestic and foreign political and military analysts believe that shahab 3 is able to reach targets in the occupied lands in case of the zionist regimes probable attacks against irans nuclear sites
967376 the war game was aimed at improving the combat readiness of irans armed forces the 2 000 kilometers range shahab 3 missiles were tested to demonstrate irans capability in hitting its enemies accurately at the early stages of their probable attacks against the islamic republic
967377 domestic and foreign political and military analysts believe that shahab 3 is able to reach targets in the occupied lands in case of the zionist regimes probable attacks against irans nuclear sites
967378 which can hit any target within a range of 2 000km
967379 nine highly advanced missiles with improved accuracy were simultaneously tested including the zelzal and fateh missiles with ranges of 400km and 170km respectively
967380 we are making all out efforts to expand peace and security in the world you should not be concerned about a new war
967381 but the iranian nuclear program and the iranian ballistic missile program must be of concern for the entire international community
967382 irans development of ballistic missiles is a violation of united nations security council resolutions and completely inconsistent with irans obligations to the world
967383 are committed to a diplomatic path and have offered iran a generous package of incentives if they will suspend their uranium enrichment activities
967384 based on reliable intelligence our enemies had plans to kidnap and kill your servant ahmadinejad but we intentionally made last minute changes in our schedule
967385 the coalition is unaware of any threats to president ahmadinejads life during his visit to iraq
967386 the enemies learned about the changes when we already had left iraq they were shocked
967387 i was the first head of government who made previous announcements about my trip to iraq
967388 british and american leaders had stayed only a few hours in iraq and had not stayed there for two days like i did
967389 if america and israel shoot any bullets and missiles against our country iranian armed forces will target the heart of israel and 32 us bases in the region before the dust from this attack has settled
967390 when oil prices change by 10 to 15 by official comments about the market oil prices will be pushed to unpredictable highs if some take an unwise decision to attack iran
967391 irgc is equipped with the most advanced missiles that can strike the enemies vessels and naval equipment with fatal blows
967392 blitzkrieg tactics and operations of the irgc boats will not leave a chance for the enemies to run away
967393 these words do not mean that the prerequisites of war are being set but these are the strategies that our alert armed forces have prepared for any hypothesis
967394 all the countries should know that if irans interests in the region are ignored it is natural that we will not allow others to use it the strait
967395 coalition forces informed the pakistan army that they were being engaged by anti afghan forces
967396 we have co ordination we have intelligence sharing if there was some doubt about any post they should have informed us before taking up any strike
967397 that is not the point we have handed over our protest to the coalition forces
967398 we will wait for their reply and whatever is their reply we would like them to consider it seriously
967399 the militants launched a cross border attack into afghanistan our soldiers were killed in a counter offensive by forces in afghanistan
967400 although it is early every indication we have is that it was a legitimate strike in self defence against forces that had attacked the coalition forces
967401 sad to see the loss of life among the pakistani military
967402 this is a reminder that better cross border communications between forces is vital
967403 the military on both sides will look into the matter and review how to prevent a recurrence
967404 the event is happening at a time when pakistan has a civilian government when there is opposition to the alliance in the so called war on terror
967405 such an incident is not likely to help strengthen that relationship but cast a shadow on it
967406 hit at the very basis of co operation and sacrifice with which pakistani soldiers are supporting the coalition in the war against terror
967407 we are still investigating it and we havent completed our investigation so i cant speak about specifics at this time
967408 all i can say is that any loss of innocent life is tragic i can assure you that civilians are never targeted in operations and that our forces go to great lengths in avoiding civilian casualties
967409 with this murder its timing location and method zionists israel if you want this kind of open war let the whole world listen let this war be open
967410 like all human beings we have a sacred right to defend ourselves
967411 we will do all that it takes to defend our country and people
967412 quite clearly hezbollah has a long record of carrying out violent acts and acts of terrorism around the globe
967413 moghaniyahs blood will lead to the elimination of israel these words are not an emotional reaction
967414 but im convinced that the solution still lies in using other elements of national power to change iranian behavior including diplomatic financial and international pressure
967415 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
967416 we have a strong force in kurdistan and we have been able to protect the security of kurdistan for years
967417 we will not stay out of the way of the turkish army we will resist
967418 turkey has not been able to accept this region up to now
967419 turkey is asking the kurdistan region for something that is beyond our ability
967420 giving them the pretext to come into the kurdish region
967421 is committed to its constructive approach and the resolution of regional and international affairs and problems
967422 we believe that the nature of our exchanges both in format and in substance were different than of previous times
967423 so i believe that we are now in a new environment with a new approaching perspective so allow us time to begin this process to make the necessary planning for it
967424 we will defend our own country in the case of any attack or invasion or any threat and the history of the past several thousand years of our land iran demonstrates that our country has never initiated an invasion or an attack that was carried out by the iranian people against another people in the region
967425 any act on iran will be considered a start of war
967426 representatives of united nations recently confirmed which the russian side categorically unreasonable refutes
967427 it is important that both ukraine and georgia demonstrate democratic maturity and stay on the reform track
967428 we are obviously keeping a particularly close eye on georgia and its relations with russia and will continue to urge moderation and respect for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
967429 the steps taken by putin in the final days of his presidency are a declaration of the occupation of two parts of the territory of georgia
967430 after our first unpiloted aircraft was shot down by a russian mig russian authorities made the decision to show that it was shot down by abkhazian air defense the next time the russians understood that they had made a big mistake when their aircraft openly shot down a georgian plane over georgian territory but i am sure that the second aircraft was shot down by russian air defense as well all the other aircraft shot down were fictitious to smooth over the effect of the first attack
967431 no one can buy that weapon on the market it is a very serious means of air defense you remember when ukrainian air defense shot down an israeli plane that was a buk they can shoot down everything at a height of 25 km our passenger planes fly at a height of 10 km and military planes at 10 15 km abkhazia already has more weapons than syria
967432 abkhazia isnt preparing for war but the russians are forcing it to prepare
967433 if there is military action there clearly that will not take georgia in nato and the russians know that very well it would be impossible for the european countries that are nato members to reach a consensus to take a state in which they are shooting into its ranks al the problems between georgia and russia began after georgias entry into nasto became realistic for russia that is a very serious problem if georgia becomes a nato member it will be a real channel to transport energy resources bypassing russia and i think military action in abkhazia is part of russias plans to stop georgias entry into nato and it is a problem for us that russia has such plans
967434 i know they planned the embargo of georgian wines and everything is going according to that plan i know the person who organized it it is kholmogorov who was a department head in the fsb they thought it would destroy the georgian economy they thought there is a lot of georgian wine in russia kholmogorov told me in vienna that they shut us out of more than billion in exports when i answered that georgian wine exports to russia were only million he was very surprised they probably counted every distillery around their dachas in balashikha outside moscow that bottles georgian and french wines
967435 but nothing terrible happened our economic growth totaled 12 5 percent no other state that doesnt have oil has had that kind of growth and we will develop in spite of it all
967436 the frame of reference of the ceasefire and separation of forces regime in the case of the georgian abkhaz conflict is the moscow agreement it provides for the cis pkf and no one else to perform the separation of forces from a strict peacekeeping perspective therefore the mission considers that enforcement action by third parties in this case the russian federation in the zone of conflict is fundamentally inconsistent with the moscow agreement
967437 the army police and paramilitary forces are patrolling the city and residents are being very supportive
967438 to hear and see what it was all like search arrest interrogation prison deportation transit camp prison camp hunger beatings labor corpses
967439 the line between good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
967440 one that was repeated by hitler with the jews and again by stalin with nationalities that were disloyal to him or suspected by him
967441 do not want to leave iran in place with a nuclear program
967442 they believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year either iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program
967443 as usual with his quarterly pieces well decline to comment
967444 the cia as a rule does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations
967445 i can tell you flatly that u s forces are not operating across the iraqi border into iran in the south or anywhere else
967446 amber means get on with your preparations stand by for immediate attack and tell us when youre ready
967447 its really all down to the israelis this administration will not attack iran this has already been decided
967448 tehrans stand is based on the legitimate rights of the iranian nation as well as the international regulations the iranian nation will continue with the path determined by the supreme leader ayatollah seyed ali khamenei
967449 common ground between the two sides and a constructive and creative view
967450 formal negotiations can start as soon as irans enrichment related and reprocessing activities are suspended
967451 by using advanced rockets and lightning tactics vessels of irans enemies shall sink deep into the persian gulf waters
967452 to give the americans all they wish of iraqs oil
967453 i advise those who follow the path of temptation should wash out this disgrace by repentance
967454 this participation in the awakening councils is a great apostasy and sedition that will lead them to hell
967455 the government of riyadh is still playing its wicked roles
967456 there has never been a fake bin laden tape so there really wouldnt be any reason going in to believe it would be anything other than authentic
967457 i would like to assure our people in palestine that we will expand our jihad there
967458 we will not recognise even one inch for jews in the land of palestine as other muslim leaders have
967459 to be fair its also being driven by attorneys that are reticent to say anything real in prosecution and end up taking many small bites at responses that in turn is driven by the courts as in festo and other cases reading anything and everything into claim limitations
967460 how it works most of the time now get foam with horrible art and horrible rejection argue get finaled file rce and argue o hai guyse now i found good references so i dont need to address how pitiful my former rejection was
967461 would attorneys be more accepting of limitations on the number of rces if they received two non finals before a final
967462 isnt the appeal fee less than the rce fee if the rejection is so atrocious why not appeal
967463 you know the uspto will use this rce statistic as an example of poor application quality when really it shows poor examination quality
967464 what bothers me about the final on second office action is that it assumes the examiners positions in the first non final office action are correct my response to the non final should be a chance for me to convince the examiner the originally filed claims are patentable then if the examiner is still unconvinced fine ill amend and the examiner can search the amended claims under the current system i have to file an rce just to amend the claims that is silly
967465 however such a practice perpetuates the practice of examiners issuing finals on bad rejections
967466 dont amend and file the rce when the rejection is bad
967467 a disturbing trend however is the growing number of cases where we file an appeal brief only to have the examiner voluntarily re open prosecution this is awfully expensive slow and simply unfair to the applicant any thoughts on this
967468 because of that i really do not have too much sympathy for most of the complaints about all the rces that you
967469 appeal re open appeal re open appeal re open etc
967470 lower under curent us prosecution practice once the examiner has established a prima facie case of anticipation or obviousness in a first office action the burden shifts to the applicant to either 1 amend or 2 come forward with convincing arguments and or evidence to rebut the prima facie case
967471 so yes current prosecution practice does start off with the assumption that the examiners positions are correct
967472 a disturbing trend however is the growing number of cases where we file an appeal brief only to have the examiner voluntarily re open prosecution this is awfully expensive slow and simply unfair to the applicant any thoughts on this
967473 appeal re open appeal re open appeal re open etc game
967474 appeal re open appeal re open appeal re open etc
967475 a disturbing trend however is the growing number of cases where we file an appeal brief only to have the examiner voluntarily re open prosecution this is awfully expensive slow and simply unfair to the applicant any thoughts on this
967476 eventually theyll either call to propose some typically meaningless amendment to save face or file an exmaminers answer or reopen again
967477 they have to eat that time that can become very painful
967478 in reality very few out of all the cases actually go thru the
967479 a steady climb for 9 years i wouldnt exactly call that a trend
967480 why an applicant should have to appeal to get a bad final withdrawn
967481 whose fault is it when a drug addict knocks over a store to get money to pay for their habit theirs or the dealer that got them hooked you are the ones that got the examiners hooked on the rce count wagon
967482 issue unintelligible faom ignore applicants arguments punch up boilerplate form paragraphs issue final rejection and cross fingers wishing for rce gravy train to appear
967483 truth be told i rarely have a need to read attorneys arguments if theres an amendment the arguments are usually irrelevant if theres no amendment ill recheck my references a couple of times ive misinterpreted abbreviations in figures the few times ive gotten to a stage with no amendment and no perceived errors the arguments usually revolve around my claim interpretation at that point i go final and suggest a minor language change
967484 um x feature isnt shown in the way it is used in the claim
967485 we believe the u s patent office is doing a good job currently and that patent quality is as high if not higher now as it was five years ago patent quality is also being recognized and rewarded in existing and emerging markets for intellectual property transfer and in the broader capital markets thankfully for those of us in the profession we are beginning to see data already there confirming what we believed all along patent quality can be measured it is improving and it makes a difference
967486 do you at least read the attorneys arguments you are not infallible and are capable of misreading and misunderstanding the art you know
967487 because with your nearly one and one half years of experience and your bs or meng theres no possible chance you misinterpreted the reference or missed something in applicants spec that defines a claim term gotcha
967488 um x feature isnt shown in the way it is used in the claim
967489 the references of record do not show the limitation of xxxxx as now recited in claim 1 99
967490 the examiner does not find the argument to be persuasive
967491 i think hope that 2600examiner misspoke you must read all of the applicants remarks not necessarily word for word as some of it will be boiler plate amp form paragraph stuff just like actions but you do need to read and consider all of the substance of the remarks
967492 um x feature isnt shown in the way it is used in the claim
967493 for the love of god never ever use a widget to do y
967494 on the flip side another pet peeve of mine is when examiners make a final amp just say the applicants remarks are moot because of new grounds but the rejections keep some or all of the same references that were explicitly argued by the applicant this is wrong the examiner needs to address all of the remarks presented if they apply the any or all of the rejections being made in the new action i too often see examiners try to do this amp i kick them actions back when i see it
967495 a widget selectively operated by a pulley the widget is not operated by a lever because for the love of god you never ever want to use a lever in this application as a widget cannot be selectively operated by a lever
967496 this happens to me routinely the rejection relies on a primary reference for its gist and a secondary reference to supply a tidbit my response i believe knocks out the primary and secondary references the second final action continues to rely on the primary reference replaces the secondary with a new secondary reference makes the rejections final and ignores my remarks deeming them moot in view of the new grounds both actions relied heavily on that primary reference and its clearly become the centerpiece of the prosecution but the examiner deliberately refused to engage in a discussion of its teaching interpretation
967497 this happens to me routinely the rejection relies on a primary reference for its gist and a secondary reference to supply a tidbit my response i believe knocks out the primary and secondary references the second final action continues to rely on the primary reference replaces the secondary with a new secondary reference makes the rejections final and ignores my remarks deeming them moot in view of the new grounds both actions relied heavily on that primary reference and its clearly become the centerpiece of the prosecution but the examiner deliberately refused to engage in a discussion of its teaching interpretation
967498 for the love of god you never ever want to use a lever in this application as a widget cannot be selectively operated by a lever
967499 prepare to be owned during a pre appeal conference as you have indicated has happened to you in the past
967500 clive youve accurately described the ticket buying process the examiners use to hop on the rce gravy train
967501 every now and again i run into those types of situations the question then becomes is the instant invention just as worthless inoperable etc as the prior teaching described it as if it is then it was obvious because youre just using the sucky feature from the prior art rather than the good feature nothing special there if you managed to use a lever and it resulted in something that worked better than expected then i might let you off
967502 i was owned because of procedural issues mostly the one where i lost on the merits was because he completely misconstrued what the prior art actually said in his background and i used that against him in a 103
967503 were talking about an after final response right how effective do you find this to be
967504 it doesnt necessarily have to be after final but i have had 3 finals withdrawn in the past 4 months using this argument
967505 i wonder how many of those continuations are filed after the applicant has been sitting around long enough to observe the trends and standards development in the industry
967506 the elephant in the room is that whatever your opinions regarding the current quality of examination continuation practice needs to be changed in some manner to thwart the increasingly common practice of using continuations to obtain new claims over things the inventor never honestly contemplated at the time of invention
967507 theres blame to be had by examiners but the prosecutors ought to recognize that theyre standing in a glass house before they start throwing stones
967508 in any case the prior art there clearly teaches away from using a lever so using one is non obvious
967509 whats your basis for your claim that this practice is
967510 oh others might do that the patents i write are as pure as the driven snow
967511 so how do you propose revising continuation rules to thwart this practice
967512 id like to see a study that delves into the details of this phenomenon by looking at the filing dates of continuations relative to their parents the litigation of continuations the frequency with with continuations are found invalid compared to other patents etc
967513 youre an examiner you probably wouldnt even answer the phone unless you were getting a count for it
967514 id like to see a study that delves into the details of this phenomenon by looking at the filing dates of continuations relative to their parents the litigation of continuations the frequency with with continuations are found invalid compared to other patents etc
967515 my basis is purely anecdotal based on the fact that of the last twenty or so patents at issue in my litigations against patent holding companies or whatever euphemism you wish all but two were continuations those continuations were filed after the accused products were on sale and years after the parent applications were filed
967516 question for the examiners that post here do you feel that your spes are doing their job in reviewing your office actions before they get sent out
967517 doing their job in reviewing your office actions before they get sent out
967518 i dont think it was sarcasm or a popa rep wrong on both counts
967519 me too but lets be clear theres nothing unethical per se about drawing a claim to cover a competitors product that appeared after an applications priority date if theres insufficient section 112 support for the claim then thats another matter
967520 yes judges do need to be better educated about written description and enablement youre a litigator why dont you do it
967521 so if youre such a hot shot litigator how hard can it be to invalidate all of these terrible continuation patents on written description or enablement grounds
967522 surely these lowly prosecutors cant be capable of such sophistry as to defeat the valiant efforts of one so mighty as yourself
967523 lax rules governing continuation practice have created opportunities for prosecutors to game the system to obtain for their clients claims for subject matter that they didnt possess at the time of the alleged invention
967524 theres no patent so clear that it is immune to being thoroughly obfuscated by patentees counsel during a jury trial
967525 judges dont get the technology most of the time and jurors cant be expected to either certainly one aspect of patent reform ought to be a constitutional amendment exempting patent litigation from the seventh amendment right to a jury trial
967526 if youre upset that the pto is doing a miserable job especially when it comes to reviewing continuations for written description and enablement take a number and get in line
967527 and theres certainly no patent that is so clear that a tricky defense attorney like you perhaps cant gin up some thoroughly phony inequitable conduct charge either
967528 heck lets just strike the whole 7th amendment certainly nobody is as smart as us lawyers
967529 the pto has made it much more difficult to obtain allowance of claims which just a few years before would be allowed and the reaction of practitioners was to file rces to try again to get the claims allowed perhaps by making minor claim revisions and or by presenting different and or more extensive supporting arguments
967530 transformation of subject matter but merely an abstract mathematical expression that is created from the previous steps
967531 does not require any physical output into the real world
967532 the limitation that the method is executed in a computer apparatus does not tie the method to a particular machine
967533 the first simulating step of the claimed process is performed on a first physical computing device and the second simulating step is performed on a second physical computing device
967534 that the patent system be directed to protecting technological innovations
967535 the patent and trademark office has now made clear that its newly developed position on patentable subject matter will invalidate many and perhaps most software patents
967536 if the claim is nothing more than a computer making calculations that given enough monkeys and calculators could be done manually there is no patentable subject matter
967537 but the governments test does not merely require a connection to a machine it requires a tie to a particular machine
967538 those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation
967539 the pagerank idea of ranking a page according to the rankings of pages linking to it should not be patentable but how they did it should be patentable imho
967540 i discuss yet another eye poking physical transformation case here
967541 ooops there blows that whole idea about rewarding inventors for their disclosure
967542 why stop at calculations give them enough test tubes and throw out pharmaceuticals give them enough tools and throw out mechanical devices
967543 is googles success a result of its page ranking software of course not its success is a result of the fact that its easy to use and elegant user interface blew everyone elses interface away
967544 perhaps you werent using web search engines prior to google
967545 in other words the secret to googles success isnt someones obsession with a lightweight interface it was their major leap forward in search result quality
967546 who cares whether googles success is based upon their patents
967547 120 a method for improving refractive ophthalmic treatment comprising obtaining a first pre operative diagnostic measurement of an individual cornea of an eye determining a first operative corneal ablation specification based on the first preoperative diagnostic measurement obtaining non tissue removing perturbation data from the individual cornea before ablation to obtain a biodynamic response data from that individual cornea obtaining a second post perturbation preoperative diagnostic measurement of the individual cornea correlating said non tissue removing perturbation data with the biodynamic response data gathered from a statistically significant number of corneas and establishing an individual customized laser ablation specification for corneal ablation for that individual cornea based at least in part on said biodynamic response data 101 subject matter or not
967548 by the way what is the secret to wikipedias success
967549 as written it reads on a purely mental process and as such is garbage
967550 obtaining a first pre operative diagnostic measurement of an individual cornea of an eye
967551 obtaining non tissue removing perturbation data from the individual cornea before ablation to obtain a biodynamic response data from that individual cornea
967552 obtaining a second post perturbation preoperative diagnostic measurement of the individual cornea
967553 when you get a chance no hurry explain to me the mental process you employ in performing the following steps
967554 obtaining a first pre operative diagnostic measurement of an individual cornea of an eye
967555 why some combination of telekinesis with lasers produced solely by the power of the mind
967556 now that is an example of an unpatentable mental process try to get your poo poo software patents now
967557 but they arent tied to any machine thats for sure
967558 tell me again how the measurements are obtained they dont just magically appear on the piece of paper even if someone wrote them down the measurements still had to be obtained from something
967559 obtaining a measurement of the spectrum reflected by the iris
967560 does the claim require that the measurements so obtained are obtained for the first time by the practioner of the claim and not previously recorded by somebody else nope
967561 obtaining a measurement of the spectrum reflected by the iris i
967562 obtaining non tissue removing perturbation data from the individual cornea before ablation to obtain a biodynamic response data from that individual cornea
967563 what is a general purpose computer hand held devices like a blackberry can be programmed to function as a general purpose computer does that make every modern cell phone and pda out there a general purpose computer
967564 obtaining non tissue removing perturbation data from the individual cornea before ablation
967565 i have made the observation many times that you dont like to answer questions
967566 does the uspto have substantive legislative powers such that they can arbitrarily and capriciously re define what
967567 19 a computer readable medium that stores instructions executable by one or more processors to perform a method for scoring documents comprising instructions for searching a plurality of documents at least some of the documents being linked documents and at least some of the documents being linking documents at least some of the linking documents also being linked documents each of the linked documents being pointed to by a link in one or more of the linking documents instructions for scoring each of the linked documents based on scores for the one or more linking documents and instructions for providing the linked documents based on their scores
967568 120 a method for improving refractive ophthalmic treatment comprising obtaining a first pre operative diagnostic measurement of an individual cornea of an eye determining a first operative corneal ablation specification based on the first preoperative diagnostic measurement obtaining non tissue removing perturbation data from the individual cornea before ablation to obtain a biodynamic response data from that individual cornea obtaining a second post perturbation preoperative diagnostic measurement of the individual cornea correlating said non tissue removing perturbation data with the biodynamic response data gathered from a statistically significant number of corneas and establishing an individual customized laser ablation specification for corneal ablation for that individual cornea based at least in part on said biodynamic response data 101 subject matter or not
967569 my view is that the idea of ranking pages using link data should not be patentable by itself which would then cover every conceivable way of calculating page weights from the link data but a particular way of doing so may be properly patentable
967570 maybe the pto is finally implementing my test if the claim is nothing more than a computer making calculations that given enough monkeys and calculators could be done manually there is no patentable subject matter
967571 then invalidate it based on novelty obviousness and or enablement
967572 the second party is still exploiting the invention but trying to do so in a crafty way claim 120 was apparently written with an eye towards getting direct infringement by such a second party
967573 in response to a search request from a network user
967574 returning a linked list of the linked and linking documents to the network user in an order determined by said score such that said documents are accessible to the network user through said linked list
967575 but lowlys and others point was that it is a poorly written claim period regardless of who the claim is
967576 a diagnosis after all is merely purely a mental step
967577 in other words the secret to googles success isnt someones obsession with a lightweight interface it was their major leap forward in search result quality
967578 if you dont grant software patents where is the incentive for innovation
967579 if you dont grant software patents where is the incentive for innovation
967580 i have a question say that pagerank was never patented in the 1st place
967581 gosh back in the bad old days when i started computer programming sometime between 1950 and 1981 when software patents were not being allowed there was no end of innovation innovations came as fast as the hardware permitted i even remember one major design meeting in about 1976 for a project where we explicitly agreed to design the software for the hardware we expected to be available two years later innovation was running ahead of the hardware i expect that game programmers do the same today
967582 instead of seeking a patent they would have relied on trade secrets which they do to a significant extent anyway
967583 all it will take is just one person with a usb flash drive or whatever small portable storage device you want to dream up to steal the trade secrets and post them on the internet
967584 in the most recent of these three the currently pending en banc bilski appeal the office takes the position that process inventions generally are unpatentable unless they
967585 transformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines
967586 thus for both langemyr and google patent eligibility under the ptos test comes down to the interpretation of the second part of the ptos test
967587 john love deputy commissioner for patent policy who joined the office in 1969 to avoid the vietnam draft
967588 the bottom line here is that a process to be statutory must perform a transformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing this test must be applied to the claims in question especially if there is only an incidental recitation of a computer apparatus in the preamble
967589 i was watching a dolphin leap out of the water one day and hey presto
967590 why arent the likes of google et al paying royalties to the estate of thomas edison or for that matter any other holder of a patent which has made their own patents systems models methods possible
967591 its easier to use a patent to go after a copycat
967592 your argument seems to be along the lines of its easier to use a patent to go after a copycat rather than patent is the right regime for protecting software
967593 second the economics of software appear to me to make the initial investment rather low so that a profit is returned more quickly
967594 moreover try to sell it at the same time saying that it is freely copyable
967595 i find it disingenuous that the software companies whined for so long about how the patent system took too long to examine and issue their patents complaining that their business cycle time was so short perhaps a max of 5 years but now embrace a system that gives them protection for 20 years ostensibly long past the date that their products have ceased to be viable does this engender innovation
967596 i find it disingenuous that the software companies whined for so long about how the patent system took too long to examine and issue their patents complaining that their business cycle time was so short perhaps a max of 5 years but now embrace a system that gives them protection for 20 years ostensibly long past the date that their products have ceased to be viable
967597 this allows competition and development this way writers of software get to compete on whos is best or has the most pleasing interface or whatever it is that the customer likes thats good too for both producers and consumers
967598 is there anyone posting to this blog who believes that professor duffy violated such ethics by not noting at the outset of his comments that he participated in preparing an amicus brief in the bilski case
967599 so do i its also unbelievable and appalling that anyone would imply that the the costs of developing a new piece of software are remotely near the cost of developing a new pharmaceutical
967600 is there anyone posting to this blog who believes that professor duffy violated such ethics by not noting at the outset of his comments that he participated in preparing an amicus brief in the bilski case
967601 without patent rights those in creative job areas producing hot cakes content will go without an income
967602 annual r amp d numbers for some big companies in the
967603 aharonian preposterously writes that obvious is meaningless and technical is meaningless most ordinary people including judges think otherwise
967604 but between the 20 year monopoly for software claims and full bore communism there is an awful lot of middle ground
967605 i want people who write software to be paid but as i recall congress already passed some pretty generous legislation to facilitate that precise result
967606 i have long felt that patentable subject matter is really a question of claim drafting and usually has no practical effect on the permissible scope of protection
967607 i just looked up the numbers easy to find just look at the income statements for the companies took me about 5 minutes to do on yahoos financial website
967608 i dont doubt the numbers pds i just cant believe you think they support the assertion that it costs as much to develop test and market a new piece of software as it does to develop test and market a new therapeutic drug for humans
967609 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
967610 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
967611 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
967612 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
967613 did i ever say that it did nooooooo did i ever imply it nooooo have i ever thought it nooooooo
967614 im guessing that you havent tried to make money selling software come up with a piece of software and try to sell it my guess is that for the time you spent developing coding testing marketing the software you would have a greater return on your time spent by working at the local burger king
967615 googles actual page rank algorithm is a jealously guarded secret and is therefore most explicilty not patentable
967616 again it is over generalized so that someone skilled in the art cant really reproduce the results without reconstructing a whole lot of the actual processes on their own
967617 then pds posted a bunch of numbers where r amp d costs for software companies versus big pharma were compiled in a way to make those costs appear similar
967618 what about these numbers make you think that the numbers arent similar
967619 the numbers are similar pds but you forgot to divide the numbers by the total number of patent applications filed
967620 so do i its also unbelievable and appalling that anyone would imply that the the costs of developing a new piece of software are remotely near the cost of developing a new pharmaceutical
967621 if pagerank was un patentable it could only be protected as a trade secret and run behind closed doors
967622 however one piece of sophisticated software may involve several hundred patentable concepts
967623 and the simulated result of a laser ablation process driven by those numbers is made to appear on the video monitor of a computer
967624 and an industry standard laser ablation apparatus attached to an otherwise general purpose computer is then driven by those numbers and thereby corrects the function of a patient cornea by transforming said cornea
967625 the patent and trademark office has now made clear that its newly developed position on patentable subject matter will invalidate many and perhaps most software patents
967626 an act or a series of acts performed upon the subject matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing
967627 transformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines
967628 an algorithm or mathematical formula like a law of nature cannot be the subject of a patent
967629 insignificant post solution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process to hold otherwise would allow a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection
967630 a program is a tool that transforms a machine into another machine
967631 every new and non obvious business and financial computer operation under the sun made by man
967632 an act or a series of acts performed upon the subject matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing
967633 which of course is precisely why people are skeptical about software patents on a practical level if a developer needed to review thousands of patents and negotiate hundreds of licensing agreements before writing a line of software then there could be no progress this problem applies particularly to smaller developers since the big players ibm microsoft etc can cross license their patent pools and avoid a lot of headaches
967634 review thousands of patents and negotiate hundreds of licensing agreements
967635 the idea of patents is not necessarily to protect a unique end result but to protect an innovative way of getting there
967636 illustrate norms of board decision making for the public the patent examining corps and future board panels
967637 the same logic could apply to semiconductors i have no doubt that intels latest chip has probably well over a thousand patentable concepts embodied in it
967638 any responsible person who wants to guarantee that this sort of patent can issue must also provide a plan for preventing the current flood of clearly insufficient and unsatisfactory patents which are crippling the industry and duffy provides no such proposal
967639 a competitor attempting to clone the algorithm to compete with google
967640 the first claim in u s patent no 6 526 440 issued feb 25 2003 which discloses an improved search engine technology does not even expressly include the limitation that the process must be computer implemented
967641 till the law changes we need for our very survival a pile of patents bigger than those of all the others we have to do this even though like leonardo we disagree with the premise peddled by our tormenters
967642 thats very difficult you have picked a bad place to start from
967643 excuse me folks but from what has been disclosed of the google page rank algorithm reminds me of the method many scientists use to rank a fellow scientist because if as i guess it is merely the computer implemented form of status ranking used by academics from time immemorial your value as a scientist is ranked by your peers in that if they quote your material they value it if they dont they dont value it then the patent is valueless and void because it is a method of status ranking as old as scientific publication
967644 well leopold i have to agree with you that with hindsight everything seems obvious
967645 next time you have an opportunity to talk to a venture capitalist ask them what they think the value of patents are for a startup
967646 and the inventors were clever enough to apply this approach to ranking documents retrieved in response to a search query
967647 btw the reason why the new recipe isnt patentable in europe is because it isnt a solution to a
967648 so why cant we patent an old piece of paper with a new recipe written on it after all food is useful
967649 prior to evaluating the claimed invention under 35 u s c 101 uspto personnel are expected to conduct a thorough search of the prior art generally a thorough search involves reviewing both u s and foreign patents and nonpatent literature in many cases the result of such a search will contribute to uspto personnels understanding of the invention both claimed and unclaimed aspects of the invention described in the specification should be searched if there is a reasonable expectation that the unclaimed aspects may be later claimed a search must take into account any structure or material described in the specification and its equivalents which correspond to the claimed means plus function limitation in accordance with 35 u s c 112 sixth paragraph and mpep 2181 through 2186
967650 as a software developer i can tell you the entire software industry including google is desperately fighting to end the horrible mess that software patents have created
967651 patent lawyers know because they get paid by all sides
967652 there is some 80 90 agreement amongst programmers that we neither want nor need double coverage by patents that software patents are illogical and a harm
967653 i cant see how arranging a list of ingredients in alphabetical order can solve a
967654 many of these new concepts will appear to be obvious in hindsight after they virally implant themselves into our collective conscious
967655 there is a crippling misunderstanding of software as a mere mathematical algorithm although at a very low level it is just that
967656 how is coming up with a new algorithm any different than coming up with a new engine
967657 i for one am not a patent attorney but i made my living for years writing original software
967658 scientists arent documents are they even if they write them and the inventors were clever enough to apply this approach to ranking documents retrieved in response to a search query
967659 although the big guys have lots of patents try surviving and prospering as a little guy without one
967660 marketing only goes so far ask pets com e toys kozmo com etc
967661 and no you need not care but please do provide an example of how software patents have caused you any issue versus say a drm patented software in accessing some content you purchased where did the patent cause the issue
967662 whats the use of that well for starters its useful for converting x y and z to x2 y2 and z2 which you might want to do if you were insert just about anything you want here
967663 there is no bright dividing line between hardware and software
967664 are you serious there can not be a brighter dividing line between hardware and software lets start with the obvious hardware is a physical object
967665 thus to me sending commands to a cpu entails the transmission of electric charge carriers i
967666 1 it is naturally obfuscated you can not see how it works just by looking at it the distributable the binary that is sold is not in a form where people can figure out how it works
967667 2 software is and always will be an algorithm its a procedure it is a set of commands that is sent to a cpu the only difference between one program and another is the order in which the commands are sent to the cpu
967668 3 because it is a set of commands that is sent to a cpu there is a finite number of ways to accomplish a task this is not a finite set of linkages or shapes that you can work with when inventing a mechanism the sky is the limit it most certainly is not with computer language
967669 i can go on but im sure that people already have their minds made up one way or another
967670 the invention would be the new algorithm the mode of implementation really being irrelevant to the
967671 it was reported today that it salaries have dropped for the first time in a long time 11 years
967672 2 software is and always will be an algorithm its a procedure it is a set of commands that is sent to a cpu the only difference between one program and another is the order in which the commands are sent to the cpu
967673 the only difference between one program and another is the order in which the commands are sent to the cpu

967703 im very pleased with her she ran well in a trial the other day and has done very well since
967704 the plan is to run her in the san domenico then again in the silver shadow two weeks later a week before the golden rose
967705 i have been working her a little bit lately and she looks a million dollars
967706 she is a top quality mare and she can go all the way
967707 obviously her best distance is a mile and at this stage she probably will run in the cox plate i would say
967708 she is a good winded horse and i was very happy with her trial
967709 it wasnt a bad trial but he changed stride the last furlong and may not have been 100 per cent happy on the thoroughtrack
967710 i dont know if he is mature enough for a victoria derby but he has shown us nice ability
967711 like most of the other trainers im desperate to get back to randwick
967712 by then we should be in a position to have bigger numbers at the races
967713 because he raced in brisbane during the winter carnival reigning to win is a lot more forward than racing to win
967714 its a shame because she was very progressive through the autumn carnival
967715 to win a good race he needs to go at least to 1600 metres
967716 he could run earlier in the group one sir rupert clarke but they might be too fast for him over 1400 around caulfield
967717 he wasnt beaten far down the straight when he ran second to swick in the salinger stakes during the cup carnival

967850 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
967851 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday
967852 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
967853 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
967854 kevins a great player a strong character in the dressing room
967855 hes a very fine player in both forms of the game hes a very determined and single minded man who knows what he wants kevin has a lot of qualities that people want in a captain he is a good lad hes a very motivated person
967856 i think the side have got to move forward and by appointing me as captain i dont think that would be a good option there are other people out there that could do a better job
967857 its disappointing the way in which hes gone out it would have been nice if he had gone out on a high hes a fine player and hes someone who will score a lot more runs for england im sure

968064 why should i try to outsing saigal let him remain enshrined in our memory let his songs remain just his songs let not even one person say that kishore kumar sang them better
968065 i was the biggest draw after dilip kumar there were so many films i was doing in those days that i had to run from one set to the other changing on the way imagine me my shirts flying off my trousers falling off my wig coming off while im running from one set to the other very often i would mix up my lines and look angry in a romantic scene or romantic in the midst of a fierce battle it was terrible and i hated it it evoked nightmares of school directors were like schoolteachers do this do that dont do this dont do that i dreaded it thats why i would often escape
968066 look i dont smoke drink or socialise i never go to parties if that makes me a loner fine i am happy this way i go to work and i come back straight home to watch my horror movies play with my spooks talk to my trees sing in this avaricious world every creative person is bound to be lonely how can you deny me that right

968068 there was this interior decorator a suited booted fellow who came to see me in a three piece woollen saville row suit in the thick of summer and began to lecture me about aesthetics design visual sense and all that after listening to him for about half an hour and trying to figure out what he was saying through his peculiar american accent i told him that i wanted something very simple for my living room just water several feet deep and little boats floating around instead of large sofas i told him that the centre piece should be anchored down so that the tea service could be placed on it and all of us could row up to it in our boats and take sips from our cups but the boats should be properly balanced i said otherwise we might whizz past each other and conversation would be difficult he looked a bit alarmed but that alarm gave way to sheer horror when i began to describe the wall decor i told him that i wanted live crows hanging from the walls instead of paintings since i liked nature so much and instead of fans we could have monkeys farting from the ceiling thats when he slowly backed out from the room with a strange look in his eyes the last i saw of him was him running out of the front gate at a pace that would have put an electric train to shame whats crazy about having a living room like that you tell me if he can wear a woollen three piece suit in the height of summer why cant i hang live crows on my walls
968069 i play different roles at different times for different people in this crazy world only the truly sane man appears to be mad look at me do you think im mad do you think i can be manipulative

968071 i was shooting in the south once i think the film was miss mary and these chaps kept me waiting in the hotel room for five days without shooting so i got fed up and started cutting my hair first i chopped off some hair from the right side of my head and then to balance it i chopped off some from the left by mistake i overdid it so i cut off some more from the right again i overdid it so i had to cut from the left again this went on till i had virtually no hair left and thats when the call came from the sets when i turned up the way i was they all collapsed thats how rumours reached bombay they said i had gone cuckoo i didnt know i returned and found everyone wishing me from long distance and keeping a safe distance of 10 feet while talking even those chaps who would come and embrace me waved out from a distance and said hi then someone asked me a little hesitantly how i was feeling i said fine i spoke a little abruptly perhaps suddenly i found him turning around and running far far away from me
968072 leena is a very different kind of person she too is an actress like all of them but shes very different shes seen tragedy shes faced grief when your husband is shot dead you change you understand life you realize the ephemeral quality of all things

968081 i am now recovering but will not be fully fit to resume my duties for some months to come

968083 i wish my successor jim may well in taking the club forward into the exciting future competitions currently being planned
968084 under davids leadership sussex achieved unprecedented success winning three county championships in five years

968086 in particular his drive to create the youth ground at blackstone near henfield the new indoor school at hove and ensuring we maximised the spen cama inheritance are evidence of his contribution to sussex cricket
968087 there is no doubt that county cricket faces an exciting but challenging future
968088 uncertainty at international level coupled with domestic restructuring in 2010 means that at sussex we will have to be smart to remain a top county

968260 we do not like their ideas we do hear them and we reject what they say
968261 if there is a miliband poll bounce which is quite likely given the favourable publicity hes had and the extraordinary unpopularity of the prime minister
968262 well id need about 6 months with all the documents in front of me
968263 no doubt the majority on the board are right wing ranters
968264 i want less sleaze and less of the gravy train
968265 none of the tory sleaze of the 1990s no cash for questions we will institute strict laws on party funding
968266 since you only have a uk parliament you have far more than 2 opposition parties oh i do love the arrogance of some english it makes the job in scotland so much easier
968267 just pointing out that we have two opposition parties led by men who look like schoolchildren
968268 is it more likely the government wasnt in the wrong or was it more likely that the government had a doctor assassinated bribed two independent judges and managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the media
968269 ill think you find that there is a lot of worth in those quangos despite that nice snappy figure of yours
968270 ulster unionist sdlp snp plaid cymru etc lib dem and conservative have i missed any do i care
968271 the starting point is not debating personalities but winning the argument about our record our vision for the future and how we achieve it
968272 please tell your mp i wont repeat my 287 but suggest you read it and consider whether thats a possible way forward
968273 my view is that gordon browns sense of purpose teamwork and the long long view
968274 anyone can shout for call for prey for an election any time they wish i know i did in 1994 5 6 etc but had to wait the full 5 years just like that im afraid fact not opinion
968275 gordon browns sense of purpose teamwork and the long long view
968276 with mr miliband as leader labour scores 24 per cent against 47 per cent for the conservatives under jack straw the justice secretary the figures are 24 45 were ed balls the schools secretary to take over labour would fall to 17 per cent in third place behind the liberal democrats on 18 per cent and the conservatives on 50 per cent in fact the only labour figure who could significantly narrow the gap with the tories is the man the party forced out of office last year tony blair yet even with mr blair as leader labour would trail the conservatives by 32 per cent to 41 per cent
968277 you havent been wrapping yourself in foil and putting your mums collander on your head and talking to those friends of yours again have you
968278 i am curious to know when you thought the government was on the verge of collapse before
968279 there are several politicans i would happily see despatched to their eternal punishment
968280 bet you dont though cos you love the attention youre now getting
968281 you gave up reading the dandy and beano you fool they are closer to reality than gordon brown i still read them i suggest you go back to comics get get a sense of humour and a taste for the real world
968282 who gave you the right to take on such a high and mighty position in relation to other peoples views and comments
968283 you sound incredibly haughty as though you are looking down your nose at everyone else on here for your self appointed superior position making judgements on the content of peoples entries
968284 ps i see gordon still has his jacket on a real man of the people
968285 the labour commenters are dropping off and making fewer comments and it is already starting to happen also look at hys pages where lab lib commenters struggling with one membership have long given up and that is definately a waste of the internet
968286 so youre threatening to disconnect from the internet in a hissy fit unless we can all improve our entries on here well do it
968287 i am quite sure that if this stupid rheteric continues we will lose more bloggers off here already some have moved away owing to the ridiculous writing of some bloggers
968288 bet you dont though cos you love the attention youre now getting
968289 i predict he wont and then well all know why
968290 miliband needs to be exposed for being a patetic fool at ideas politics and as a person so let him become a challenge to gb ruin both their careers immediately
968291 here we make silly jokes rather like basil faultys silly walk so dont get too upset
968292 and about 90 of posts i notified moderators about have been deleted

968295 in a recent interview with think progress however seymore hersh the pulitzer prize winning journalist and few of the genuine investigative journalists worthy of the name exposed that the meeting witnessed cheney mulling over a proposal to dress up navy seals as iranians and shoot them in order to trigger a war with iran

968301 the history of the past 11 years is pretty clear on virtually every big argument that divided britain in 1997 labour has been proved right and the tories wrong we won so convincingly that david cameron s ambition is to sound like us
968302 i believe that socially speaking conservative policies simply cost too much in the end unemployment class division and neglect invariably follow consrevative governments
968303 nick robinsons blog is a detailed and thorough analysis of whether a new chancellor is needed and worth reading for that
968304 i agree with nick robinson that as journalists we will be sorry to see mr bush go he gives great quote
968305 nick robinson has an interesting take on why it david davis resignation may be bad for the conservatives

968309 to say the yahoo shareholders annual meeting was the biggest yawn ever might be construed as mean but then you
968310 this clearly indicates the potential for reliable operation of directly modulated 850 nm vcsels at very high data rates for future high capacity data communication links
968311 this breakthrough was enabled by a good understanding of the various speed limiting effects as well as the availability of advanced numerical simulation tools
968312 our vcsels are oxide confined vcsels where a small opening in an electrically isolating layer of oxidized alas is used as a current aperture and an optical waveguide
968313 it turns out that most of the capacitance comes from charge stored over this layer and we have lowered the capacitance by using two such layers rather than one this reduces the capacitance by almost a half
968314 we have increased the differential gain by using strained ingaas algaas quantum wells rather than unstrained gaas algaas quantum wells while choosing the in and al content in the wells and barriers respectively to still enable lasing at 850 nm
968315 we have minimized heat generation by carefully engineering the design of the distributed bragg reflectors of the vcsel to minimize the electrical resistance and the optical loss

968354 he did very well in training on thursday friday and again on saturday and well see what the situation is
968355 for the last year hes said on a number of occasions hed like a fresh challenge
968356 we had a little bit of interest for nicky last week but i didnt feel it was an acceptable market valuation
968357 its an unsatisfactory situation first and foremost id love nicky to be happy to play here and really to feel his future is with us
968358 he wants to go we have an asset so whats the value ive said to players if they dont want to be here as long as we get an acceptable market value they can go
968359 just to make people happy im not going to sell people cheaply we dont have to sell players for financial reasons
968360 its unsatisfactory now because it could well be that hes still here next week and we cant spend a lot of money in the market just in case he is still here
968361 signing a left back has been one of our primary targets all pre season because weve been anticipating this situation
968362 there are certain players wed like but they cost an awful lot of money do we spend the money and then find nicky shoreys still here
968363 other players have become available to us who i have felt would be stop gaps id much prefer mix and match from within
968364 stephen hunt would prefer to play wide on the left but it would be doing me a great favour if hed play left back

968450 successful indeed are the believers those who with their salaat prayers are khashioon and those who turn away from al lagw and those who pay the zakaat and those who guard their chastity i e private parts from illegal sexual acts except from their wives or captives and slaves that their right hands possess for then they are free from blame but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors those who are faithfully true to their amanah and to their covenants and those who strictly guard their salaat these are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit the firdaus they shall dwell therein forever
968451 b those who with their salaat prayers are khashioon those who possess khushoo
968452 seek help in patience and salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for the khashioon those who possess al khushoo
968453 this verse implies condemnation of those who are not khashioon condemnation only applies when something obligatory is not done or when something forbidden is done if those who do not have khushoo are to be condemned this indicates that khushoo is obligatory
968454 the first thing to be lifted up taken away from this ummah will be khushoo until you will see no one who has khushoo
968455 out of a person being good muslim is his leaving alone what does not benefit him

968457 the faith of a man cannot be straight unless his heart is straight and his heart cannot be straight unless his tongue becomes straight
968458 adopt silence this is the way of causing shaytan to run away it is a supporter to you in the matter of your religion
968459 most commentators say that the meaning here is the zakaat that is paid on wealth
968460 indeed he succeeds who purifies himself zakkaha and indeed he fails who corrupts himself
968461 they are free from blame but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors
968462 come not near to zina verily it is fahishah immoral sin and an evil way
968463 there is nothing i fear for my ummah more than the deed of the people of loot
968464 and remember loot when he said to his people do you commit al fahishah evil great sin every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse sodomy while you see one another doing evil without any screen do you practice your lusts on men instead of women nay but you are a people who behave senselessly there was no other answer given by his people except that they said drive out the family of loot from your city verily these are men who want to be clean and pure so we saved him and his family except his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind and we rained down on them a rain of stones so evil was the rain of those who were warned
968465 whoever of you finds someone doing the deed of the people of loot kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done
968466 both of them fornication and homosexuality involve immorality that goes against the wisdom of allahs creation and commandment for homosexuality involves innumerable evil and harms and the one to whom it is done would be better off being killed than having this done to him because after that he will become so evil and so corrupt that there can be no hope of his being reformed and all good is lost for him and he will no longer feel any shame before allah or before his creation the scholars differed as to whether the one to whom it is done will ever enter paradise there are two opinions which i heard shaikh al islam rahimahullah narrate
968467 the signs of the hypocrite are three when he speaks he lies when he makes a promise he breaks it and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust
968468 verily allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due
968469 the rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep
968470 and those who strictly guard their five compulsory congregational salaat prayers at their fixed stated hours
968471 allah has obligated five prayers whoever excellently performs their ablutions prays them in their proper times completes their bows prostrations and khushoo has a promise from allah that he will forgive him and whoever does not do that has no promise from allah he may either forgive him or punish him
968472 the first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the day of judgment is the prayer if it is sound then the rest of his deeds will be sound and if it is bad then the rest of his deeds will be bad
968473 if a person had a stream outside his door and he bathed in it five times a day do you think he would have any filth left on him
968474 that is like the five daily prayers allah wipes away the sins by them
968475 verily the prayer keeps one from the great sins and evil deeds
968476 these are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit the firdaus they shall dwell therein forever
968477 if you ask allah for paradise then ask him for firdaus for it is the highest part of paradise in the middle of paradise and from it spring the rivers of paradise and above it is the mighty throne of the most merciful

968480 defensively he can change the game around for you best case scenario he gets himself healthy and they have a guy who makes it very difficult for other people to score
968481 theres enough tools there to work with offensively but hes got to get his body ready to play in the nba
968482 he could be a guy who protects the basket with the best of them in college

968484 our charts didnt show any reefs in that area at all we just hit this reef at 4 oclock this morning really heavily
968485 i think its about time they did something to recognize her
968486 theres just not enough words to describe what she does for this place
968487 i said next time we meet bring a friend not necessarily from the church but as long as theyre 60 or more
968488 and we grew and grew at that time there were very few seniors groups at all in the city or the suburbs
968489 i thought they should make a senior center when they were doing it and they did when it was built it was supposed to be the senior center and as the years went by the powers that be started calling it the community center but it was always ours first
968490 shes really taken the program and gotten it going shes just done a tremendous amount for the residents and the seniors of the village and we just wanted to show our appreciation
968491 theyve always got something going on if you dont have anything to do for the day you can always come down and find something to do if it wasnt for jean we probably wouldnt be here she keeps it going and makes sure everybodys got somebody
968492 its corny but its brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people
968493 we were very fortunate to find a place out here
968494 i am very upset that they wont take a good hard look at this
968495 i think we need to give the voters the opportunity to voice their choice i think ron thinks this problem is going to go away
968496 there is no reason for us to be charged twice
968497 i could not get the information from the county to move forward with that committee
968498 the only part of that i disagree with is the road service
968499 we go into penfield i dont send them a bill
968500 the town board members feel very comfortable with the number of police officers now
968501 we are working diligently to come up with the data for these services
968502 i can tell you from a state perspective it is a very complex issue there is a myriad of issues that need to be discussed
968503 people in the webster community stand square behind their police department i have never heard one negative comment about the police department
968504 se recordar a solzhenitsin sobre todo por el papel hist rico que desempe por haber llamado la atenci n sobre el funcionamiento de los campos sovi ticos y por su confrontaci n intelectual con el comunismo y el marxismo
968505 i am very happy with the way this weekend has gone
968506 i had a lot of pressure from haga in race two and on many corners it made me make mistakes i am very happy with the wins

968509 the bbfc should realise there are scenes of gratuitous violence in the dark knight to which i certainly would not take my 11 year old daughter it should be a 15 certificate
968510 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
968511 now with each bus trip everyones filing a blog report every little thing is picked up and off it goes
968512 we have to find a balance he won the primary essentially on a bus with the press hes intensely loyal to the back and forth with the press its who he is it will always be part of our mix
968513 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
968514 a whole lot of groups out there that nobody has ever heard of
968515 no end in sight because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america no to independence from foreign oil
968516 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
968517 ive been telling people the truth whether i thought thats what they wanted or not
968518 i went to the people of new hampshire to tell them the truth sometimes i told them what they wanted to know sometimes i told them what they didnt want to know
968519 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
968520 i think its a dramatic example of the influence of special interests here in the congress
968521 its a combination of the utilities and the coal companies and automobile manufacturers an unholy alliance of special interests that have made it a top priority to prevent any action being taken
968522 how much damage will have been done before we act
968523 ok ok i get it mccain doesnt know anything about the economy leave the poor guy alone already
968524 americans dont like congress right now but they dont like republicans more than they dislike democrats
968525 were not going to be back in the majority in the senate next year
968526 a change of that magnitude is more than we have seen in 20 million years
968527 if we had wanted to destroy as much of life on earth as possible there would have been no better way of doing it than to dig up and burn as much fossil hydrocarbon as we possible could
968528 this system destroys biodiversity contributes to global climate change and degrades soil and water quality
968529 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
968530 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
968531 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
968532 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
968533 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
968534 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
968535 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
968536 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
968537 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
968538 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
968539 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
968540 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
968541 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
968542 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
968543 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
968544 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
968545 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
968546 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
968547 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
968548 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
968549 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
968550 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
968551 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
968552 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
968553 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
968554 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
968555 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
968556 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
968557 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
968558 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
968559 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
968560 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
968561 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
968562 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
968563 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
968564 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
968565 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
968566 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
968567 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
968568 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
968569 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
968570 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
968571 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
968572 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
968573 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
968574 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
968575 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
968576 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
968577 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
968578 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
968579 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
968580 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
968581 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
968582 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
968583 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
968584 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
968585 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
968586 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
968587 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
968588 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
968589 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
968590 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
968591 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
968592 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
968593 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
968594 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
968595 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
968596 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
968597 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
968598 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
968599 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
968600 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
968601 water infiltrating the concrete slabs freezes and then thaws weakening the concrete and rusting the steel
968602 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
968603 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
968604 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
968605 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
968606 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
968607 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
968608 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
968609 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
968610 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
968611 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
968612 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
968613 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
968614 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
968615 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
968616 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
968617 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
968618 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
968619 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
968620 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
968621 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
968622 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
968623 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
968624 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
968625 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
968626 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
968627 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
968628 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
968629 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
968630 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
968631 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
968632 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
968633 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
968634 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
968635 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
968636 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
968637 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
968638 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
968639 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
968640 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
968641 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
968642 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
968643 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
968644 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
968645 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
968646 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
968647 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
968648 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
968649 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
968650 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
968651 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
968652 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
968653 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
968654 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
968655 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
968656 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
968657 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
968658 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
968659 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
968660 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
968661 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
968662 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
968663 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
968664 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
968665 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
968666 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
968667 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
968668 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
968669 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
968670 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
968671 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
968672 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
968673 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
968674 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
968675 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
968676 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
968677 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
968678 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
968679 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan

968681 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
968682 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
968683 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
968684 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
968685 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
968686 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
968687 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
968688 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
968689 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas
968690 he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
968691 bill ayres thought he and barry were friends and the wives were friendly too but they werent prepared for that big ol bus that runs right over you
968692 if we go into iran with the idea of reducing the co2 output of its leaders maybe the could get the dhimms to be on our side probably not
968693 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
968694 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
968695 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
968696 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
968697 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
968698 would be unlikely to yield the results american policymakers do want and likely to yield results that they do not
968699 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
968700 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
968701 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
968702 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
968703 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
968704 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
968705 theyve taken a loophole in the law and with 15 people they have managed to establish themselves as a fringe party whose sole purpose is to confuse voters that democrats have support from a phantom party
968706 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
968707 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
968708 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
968709 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
968710 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
968711 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
968712 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
968713 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
968714 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
968715 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
968716 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
968717 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
968718 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
968719 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
968720 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
968721 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
968722 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
968723 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
968724 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
968725 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
968726 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
968727 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
968728 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
968729 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
968730 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
968731 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
968732 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
968733 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
968734 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
968735 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
968736 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
968737 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
968738 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
968739 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
968740 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
968741 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
968742 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
968743 im gonna get me so of that reward and shut that mans pie hole up once and for all
968744 i never heard a man moan so much about anything much less about global warming and the coming judgment day he done scared the hell out of my chickens now they dont lay as many eggs as before
968745 when im done thinking up something that will finally shut that man up i just know my chickens will be laying like the used to
968746 but for now theyll have to wear ear plugs you best get a pair too because its gonna be a long ten years of hearing that man talking without them
968747 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
968748 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
968749 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
968750 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
968751 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
968752 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
968753 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
968754 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
968755 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
968756 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
968757 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
968758 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
968759 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
968760 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
968761 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
968762 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
968763 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
968764 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
968765 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
968766 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
968767 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
968768 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
968769 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
968770 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
968771 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
968772 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
968773 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
968774 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
968775 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
968776 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
968777 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
968778 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
968779 i heard people say that they didnt have a right to vote from abroad
968780 a vote is a vote regardless of where you are for anyone who says they dont have a right to vote you do
968781 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
968782 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
968783 i think youll see that we will answer the call
968784 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
968785 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
968786 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
968787 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
968788 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
968789 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
968790 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
968791 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
968792 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
968793 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
968794 i heard people say that they didnt have a right to vote from abroad
968795 a vote is a vote regardless of where you are for anyone who says they dont have a right to vote you do
968796 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
968797 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
968798 i think youll see that we will answer the call
968799 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
968800 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
968801 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
968802 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
968803 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
968804 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
968805 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
968806 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
968807 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
968808 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
968809 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
968810 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
968811 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
968812 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
968813 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
968814 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
968815 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
968816 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
968817 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
968818 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
968819 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
968820 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
968821 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
968822 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
968823 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
968824 you know its not about you its about your country

968828 change which have driven his campaign from the start mccain will be trading on his experience
968829 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities to talk about his vision for turning the page on the failed politics of the past
968830 in honor of sen obamas birthday our volunteers will talk to their neighbors to share the story of his lifetime a story of bringing people together to create positive change as a community organizer a civil rights lawyer a constitutional law professor a state ssenator and now a u s senator
968831 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities
968832 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
968833 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
968834 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
968835 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
968836 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
968837 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
968838 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
968839 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
968840 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
968841 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
968842 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
968843 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
968844 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
968845 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
968846 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
968847 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
968848 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
968849 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
968850 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
968851 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
968852 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
968853 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
968854 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
968855 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
968856 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
968857 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
968858 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
968859 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
968860 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
968861 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
968862 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
968863 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
968864 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
968865 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
968866 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
968867 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
968868 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
968869 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
968870 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
968871 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
968872 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
968873 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
968874 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
968875 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging

968881 the literary smart girl is still showing up in literature but shes often the sidekick it is a reflection of a culture thats placing less value on intelligence and also treating intelligence as a stigmatized quality
968882 i understand why television would be harmful if it was the entertainment all of the time if kids watched t v to the exclusion of doing anything else but im okay with the way we watch in our house whether the studies say i should be or not
968883 but most of all im happy to have the picture of dads car because the next time i saw that car it was in a black and white photo of the cape cod times shot full of holes the front window was shattered the driver side window completely knocked out and the driver side door freshly painted green was riddled with shotgun pellets

968940 i have read and considered a number of reports from experts it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition

968942 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives

968963 in the future i think it is necessary we have an exact and precise ruling
968964 it has been decided for 2012 to avoid any misunderstandings and problems plus or not plus three overage players that the whole item of the presence of football in the olympic games shall be discussed immediately after the conclusion of the 2008 olympic games together with the ioc
968965 the discussion will be open and is designed to have a clear and clean situation for everybody for the 2012 olympics which will be played in london
968966 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let the young players have the experience
968967 jurgen klinsmann wrote in his book the moment i received the bronze medal in the olympics in seoul 1988 when germany beat italy it was my number one outstanding emotion
968968 we need the leagues and the clubs but we need players even if the ruling is negative for the players they should stay here they should play here
968969 the 2012 games will be played in london there is another problem there because the four british associations have to put in one team which would be called great britain
968970 it is a unique problem they have four individual associations they have one olympic association
968971 the national olympic committee of great britain tried to ask fifa to make an exception for the womens team who qualified through europe but it was not possible
968972 the first olympic games after the second world war were organised in london there was a british football team there therefore also in 2012 there will be a british team

968999 on june 30 mullah nazir commander of the taliban of the ahmadzai wazir tribe of south waziristan and hafiz gul bahadur wazir leader of the taliban of the uthmanzai wazir and daur tribes of north waziristan announced the merger of their groups under a common front the local taliban movement to fight isaf nato and u
969000 it is however generally believed that the bloc was formed as an attempt to counter baitullah mahsud and his ttp as stated by a pro mullah nazir tribal elder who attended a jirga tribal council to ratify the nazir bahadur agreement the move aims at allowing the two leaders to forge unity against mahsud daily times lahore july 8 the agreement comes against a backdrop of increasing terrorist activity by the baitullah mahsud led ttp against the pakistani government as well as militant raids in june to punish the pro government hajji turkistan group from the neighboring bhittani tribe both mullah nazir and hafiz gul bahadur are pro government and shun terrorist activities within pakistan

969004 to summarize hillary clinton is running on a message that does not match what voters are looking for experience chose a poorly worded egocentric campaign slogan that embodies the worst conceptions people have of her and is unable to strongly make the case for her candidacy e g support her brand image without inviting blowback that would lessen the potency of her attacks while it is still possible that obama could stumble and clinton could emerge victorious her once near certain chances of snaring the nomination have gone up in smoke and a lot of these problems are due to simple marketing problems rather than obamas strength
969005 the vice presidency is not worth a warm bucket of spit
969006 they might as well just lie back and enjoy it
969007 this election is too important to waste my vote on a third party
969008 id like to cut his nuts off for flipping on fisa
969009 there is one big problem with conservatism as it applies to these disasters
969010 i certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces as a prisoner of war and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility
969011 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
969012 just because youve done something heroic in the past doesnt qualify you for the presidency
969013 the problem is even though clarks argument is valid it is politically foolish because criticizing mccains military service only reinforces barack obamas lack of military service and shifts the conversation back to mccains strength
969014 reagan had no military experience and he made a viable leader of the military
969015 even if you never met him you know this guy hes the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
969016 citizens should stand at attention and salute at the first note and hold the salute through the last note
969017 and as the number of blacks entering the middle class rises the less appealing the same old arguments about the government keeping people down and the government not giving people a fair shake become thus making conservatism get a second look
969018 look at me im successful i made it it is possible for someone like me to be successful in this country
969019 as blacks rise into the middle class they can tell their peers look at me im successful
969020 by his presence and efforts in behalf of chicagos poor in addition to whatever work obama accomplished there he made a potentially powerful statement look i grew up in modest circumstances but by studying working and hanging in there i made it
969021 conservatism and the principles it supports are where i find the most fault heres why
969022 while the rhetoric is promising in the end theyre still oil and gas guys
969023 when voters complain about their politicians not offering enough specifics media feeding frenzies like this magazine cover are often to blame
969024 just so darned informed about politics and that they the presidential race seriously
969025 the media are arguably covering barack obama more often and more favorably than john mccain
969026 but how much sense does it make for john mccain to complain about not getting any media attention and then decline a perfect opportunity to get the attention he seeks
969027 barack obama has only visited iraq once and that was 871 days ago obamas failure to visit iraq listen and learn firsthand and witness the surges progress demonstrates weak leadership that disqualifies him from being commander in chief
969028 i dont see how a united states senator who is looking to be the nominee of his party and create policy with regards to terrorism and policy with regards to iraq could simply avoid going to iraq and learning about how the surge was working i mean the surge was working its too bad he missed it
969029 regarding the future in iraq which contradicts mccains position of not creating
969030 you cant insult americans by pointing out problems with america
969031 barack obama has only visited iraq once and that was 871 days ago obamas failure to visit iraq listen and learn firsthand and witness the surges progress demonstrates weak leadership that disqualifies him from being commander in chief
969032 we have to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
969033 as for biden should obama win the nomination do not be surprised if obama considers him as his running mate because the message of obama 08 is quite similar to the message of biden 88 and adding biden to the ticket would lend obamas presidential campaign some much needed pragmatism and experience to assuage voters who are not content solely with his message of

969039 det er som forventet vi havde ventet en nedjustering om end det ser lidt v rre ud en forventet
969040 en del af nedjusteringen tilskrives valutakurser men ogs i salget er der en nedjustering de henviser til fortsat pres p den europ iske forretning og en stigende konkurrence
969041 nej vi snakkede allerede om det i forbindelse med andet kvartal der var d rligere end ventet hvilket gjorde at de skulle realisere en organisk v kst p 10 pct i tredje kvartal for at komme igennem med den foreliggende m ls tning allerede dengang satte jeg sp rgsm lstegn ved hvorvidt det var muligt og ventede en nedjustering ogs uden valutakurser det er den nedjustering vi f r nu
969042 vi skal nok en smule ned da det jo ikke er positivt p den anden side kan det ikke komme bag p nogen at valutaerne har udviklet sig som de har gjort
969043 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
969044 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
969045 polow da don did the beat thats all ill say polow did the beat i aint saying whos featured on it or nothing like that im just saying when it comes out we aint doing no leaks we aint doing nothing when it comes out straight video straight radio all in the same day
969046 im from south atlanta shawty lo from west atlanta gucci mane is from east atlanta and basically you know its swagger its all about your swag dudes going louis dudes going gucci dudes going prada so i was like let me go gucci real quick we hooked up went into the studio knocked the song out and basically its like three 12 bar verses we just spittin about how swagged out we are basically just a swag record i went in i did the beat
969047 that was gonna be my first single leading into my second album
969048 it was a hot record three million views on youtube two million plays all that but i didnt wanna go back that route no more like i was already successful with a big dance song this record was incorporated with a dance it was another big dance and it was about to take over again i told the record company i was like stop i dont wanna come back dancing cause the question that everybodys asking is like what am i gonna come back with so i could have took back over with that record but i think dancing is starting to get a little corny so i was like man im gonna hold off on that tip so i just threw it on the mixtape its heavy in the streets we gonna shoot an underground video to it
969049 basically the record is just talking about the fact that im successful in the industry so i got a lot of cheese
969050 i made 6 mil at 16 so basically im just saying im on a shopping spree just talking cash money thats all
969051 i went to barack obamas office right before he started running for president
969052 so you know we went in and talked and everything people were wondering what we talked about it was confidential but i was a firm supporter of barack even before he decided to run for the presidency so im all for it man were making history and were still going strong so make sure you vote obama believe that 08
969053 its great i want it back i want the records back
969054 he has the music its right there in the computer
969055 i stop by his studio every time and get something that adds something significant to my project each time im about to put a record out and i spend three or four days there to me hes the best producer in the game
969056 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
969057 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
969058 im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out
969059 when we came out i can say it now i actually hated puff daddy
969060 i can say that now cause puff is my man i was disgusted at what they was doing with the shiny suits and the blow up dolls and looking like missy i didnt agree with that i felt the shiny suit movement was destroying the grimy movement as i got older i learned to respect people for doing different things at that time pone was actually locked up i was on the streets and i would turn on bet and mtv it would be the shiny suit dudes it was a messed up time mase was killing them
969061 yall can say what yall wanna say about mase but he was killin them you almost wanted to throw on something shiny they caught remember jay with the sunshine video he had the ferris wheel the cyclone whatever it was real hard
969062 first time its just mobb deep and cnn capone n noreaga
969063 we got prodigy we got him in jail on the phone call we got him before jail after jail thats it we dont know the name of it
969064 we letting them know we relevant we survived the storm
969065 nothings changed we always gonna be relevant as long as good music is relevant
969066 people think capone and nore we havent lived in the hood for the past 12 years so they think we may be in hollywood or la la land the record is basically nore telling me i never should have went there but i had to do it hollywood is not hollywood as you know it though
969067 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
969068 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
969069 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
969070 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
969071 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
969072 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
969073 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
969074 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
969075 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
969076 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
969077 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
969078 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
969079 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
969080 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
969081 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
969082 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
969083 ultimately the concept of the video deals with humanity and the relationships between human beings and how your basic sense of humanity can override any sort of politicized situation
969084 its about being compassionate and humanistic in that sort of situation so you could call it a microcosm of whats happening in the world today

969092 one of the problems weve had over the years is we had no method to teach surgeons surgical skills without going into surgery
969093 we now have simulators that help them develop those skills the problem is they are incredibly expensive like a flight simulator for a pilot
969094 this gives us a much less costly way to train these fine motor skills that the surgeons employ during surgery

969099 when we went off in the second run through palsankyla on friday afternoon it was a very very big moment for us i would say we went off the road at about 180kp h incredible i really thought we were going to roll we collected a puncture on the left rear tyre which was there for the rest of the stage and i hurt my right shoulder in the impact it was bad
969100 its been a really good day today though a day ive really enjoyed

969102 i learnt of my removal when a journalist phoned the night before i left for an official visit in china three weeks ago i thought it was just media speculation and brushed it off
969103 i was shocked to read in south african newspapers quoting anonymous sources saying i was fired as premier and people in china started asking questions it was humiliating
969104 information was leaked to the press with no attempt to actually call and inform me i was not given any opportunity to state my case as the law permits
969105 i expected them to give me a service delivery audit report and show me where i have failed but they said abantu bathi people say you have failed
969106 honestly i dont think i have done that bad i have served the people of the eastern cape with great passion and they love me
969107 i felt very lonely and alone the opposition had a field day as they would stand up and say even your own people said so
969108 together with the local media they were campaigning to destroy me for all my four years as premier
969109 i am greatly relieved and at peace i have no regrets and have forgiven all those who vilified me
969110 without my salary i will have to learn to scale down and live off my farm i have been keeping a diary for 25 years and want to start writing a book about my life soon

969155 thomson is well positioned to take advantage of this exciting opportunity
969156 i saw this location and thought it was like a film set from aliens or doom or something similar but better because its real
969157 i noted in particular the low light capability we were going to be shooting 80 metres underground so the low light is obviously going to be a benefit and the cinealta badge which sony only put on if they think its film quality
969158 i thought it was affordable easy to use and very simple for playback on set its also a smallish camera so it would get into all the nooks and crannies that a big film camera cant get into
969159 the goal was always to blow up to film so we needed high resolution progressive images and the xd cam format allowed that
969160 second the ability to shoot slow motion when needed with our main cameras since we wanted to roll them both when we were doing squib hits and blood spurts and smashing glass and so forth
969161 and finally the low light capability of the ex 1 which was the deciding factor the location and schedule were such that we needed a clean useable image from the available lighting in the bunker
969162 measured against the larger shoulder mounted cameras the compromise in comfort was more than offset by the smaller size and weight
969163 i dont think we could have run around the corridors of the bunker for days as we did with the bigger cameras not without crashing into things or collapsing from fatigue halfway through the schedule
969164 as good as youll find in this class of camera
969165 it was great to have virtually every picture adjustment conceivable and to have it be finely tuned over 200 steps i was able to tailor the detail and the gamma for our specific purposes
969166 on top of that there are interesting presets built in and you can customise to your hearts content

969170 our reaction here is pretty much like that of a number of other departments just because the site does allow people to unfairly complain about officers and make unsubstantiated claims
969171 then again people do that on blogs and various places like that i would just say that this is one more place where people can use the internet to put any kind of unsubstantiated info out in the world

969217 what i think has been an approach to the mccain campaign is to say hes risky to try to divert focus from the fact that they dont have any new ideas when it comes to fixing the economy or dealing with healthcare or dealing with education
969218 it was freezing and we had a laugh but it would not have been funny if someone died
969219 ho trovato una persona nuova che mi tratta meglio ha la met dei tuoi anni ed due volte pi sexy di te
969220 that becomes a very significant amount that would help alleviate gas and energy prices
969221 they can advise us supply us with what we need and bring new technology
969222 he shows us the beauty to be seen and gives us eyes to see it
969223 how to take amazing photos and enjoy yourself while doing it
969224 i believe the fact that wright state received these photographs is a testament to our strong arts program and the galleries commitment to sharing contemporary art with the public
969225 of course its very exciting to add warhols name to the already impressive roster of artists we hold in our collection
969226 the program offers institutions that do not have the means to acquire works by warhol the opportunity to bring a significant number of photographs into their permanent collections while allowing those institutions that do have warhol in their collections to enrich the breadth and depth of their holdings
969227 the polaroid photos often served as source material for his silk screened prints and paintings
969228 because warhol used photo based screenprint stencils for his artwork he continually needed source images to reproduce most of his black and white photographs on the other hand were documentation of a time and place and their spontaneity a refreshing contrast to the staged polaroids
969229 we played to a packed house both nights and the music was good and i think we made a positive impact on the new owners
969230 ive always liked pacchia and one of the biggest reasons is the musicians can go in and play what they want to play
969231 we dont have to water things down or play things that are not in keeping with what the group is about we do play requests but we dont get the kind of requests we dont want to play
969232 you are not above everything the chief minister is not above the law
969233 if this is your attitude then let the chief minister and others appear we will issue warrants of arrest
969234 ive been spending a lot of time at the antique mall
969235 my goal is to just keep filling it up through election day
969236 i want to include this notion of guilt or anger
969237 my name is towner whitney no thats not exactly true my real first name is sophya never believe me i lie all the time
969238 i am a crazy woman that last part is true
969239 the truth was there were no witches in old salem but they thrived here in great numbers now
969240 this cant be happening this must be a dream or a hallucination i have to fight to stay here part of me is already going away distancing myself from the inevitable i am going under
969241 he nicked my bottle of vodka so i punched him in the face we decided to form a band the next day
969242 we were the only kids messed up enough to skip class and listen to joy division and cut ourselves it was us against the world
969243 even though benga has a local approach to it its coming from a similar background as rock
969244 you can hear it in the chords in the beats based off of what they call rumba which is something they were playing in the u s as well the connection goes back to older rock were not talking about blue oyster cult
969245 there are bands of young people struggling to make a record and play in clubs even the record business over there theres always been a lot of small independent labels its surprising how similar these things can be even though life is completely different there
969246 yeah in kenya they kind of live by that as a rule
969247 theres not much screwing around and its mostly out of necessity they dont have a choice its hard to find a location to record in kenya so i did most of my recordings in clubs which are out of commission during the daytime so theyre quiet and you can set up there i had recorded a couple bands at a club called the annex over on the east side of nairobi so we just recorded it there
969248 ive always appreciated that style of practicing getting something where it needs to be and recording it directly without much fuss
969249 if you talk to a lot of musicians theyll tell you the first take is the best anyway
969250 out of most of the people i had worked with while in kenya it seemed that his style of playing guitar and composing songs would go really well with the unique thing we were doing with extra golden
969251 so we got him involved and eventually got to the u s to perform and after that small tour in 2006 we recorded the new record
969252 you know we got interviewed by the new york times and they asked what we thought of vampire weekend and i had never even heard of them when i did there was a little nod to an african sound but not really
969253 we were doing this long before i started hearing about those bands so i certainly dont see extra golden as part of some trend
969254 i havent really been listening to much music lately because ive been trying to write my dissertation
969255 i mean ive been listening to lots of kenyan music for better or worse
969256 im sure he is but im sure he has other things on his mind
969257 i mean that would be cool were available for rallies
969258 in 1999 a crack series of nu metal rap rock bands should have been sent to dollar bins by a discerning public for terrible records they committed these bands promptly escaped from maximum critical scrutiny to the ozzfest underground today still wanted by grumpy suburban teens they survive as shitty major label dinosaurs if you have no taste if no one else can offer music and if you can find them maybe you can hire the 1999 team
969259 the more tasteless and uncool we can make our music the better and that only when you lose the fear of breaking the unwritten rules of musical etiquette can you make a really great album
969260 there are definately some promising tracks here and after a few listens its definately growing on me
969261 weve tried to write classic songs work the sounds around them instead of experimenting too much
969262 it allowed me to think purely about the music to have somebody to help me realize some things he brought a lot more out of me
969263 as a leader in rare and hard to find books abebooks brings added breadth and expanded selection to our customers worldwide
969264 my grandfather was german and didnt want his sons to fight the germans
969265 he took a gun to the dayton train station and was arrested for attempting to kill a soldier leaving for germany the soldier who was his son
969266 you get to play a role that nobody has defined
969267 you may be a good playwright but youre a lousy reader
969268 literature is about the encounter between the reader and the word a play is about the encounter between the actor and the audience the writers job in the theater is to make the actors look good its about creating the opportunity for the actors to create compelling behavior
969269 these are issues we all struggle with they are not only historical but current this play stirs up uncomfortable things we all need to look at in ourselves
969270 with several ideas for polishing and rewriting based on judges and audience comments
969271 that production is slated for november the college hopes to take it to the american college theater festival early next year we are interested in identifying other interested theaters as well
969272 we knew we would have to make it part of this years concert after we sold out every ticket again last year when we took a big group of students to cincinnati to see it for the second time
969273 you wont know any of the music from that one unless you happen to be well over 100
969274 the muse machine in concert wicked and the songs of oz
969275 to be fair to nicky he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
969276 but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
969277 asus who are making the nuvifone for garmin remain in a business relationship with the company despite the nuvifone being set back from the second half of this year to the first half of next year
969278 it is a nonsense for anyone to suggest a transfer cannot be processed simply because i am not in attendance
969279 i was away from the office for a few hours on wednesday afternoon but i was available by phone and there were two directors present who could have completed the deal if it had been possible to do so
969280 terms had been agreed with the player but we were still not in a position to complete the deal at that time
969281 we were waiting for charlton to return a signed transfer agreement between the two clubs and were still awaiting the results of the players medical which we knew would not arrive until thursday morning
969282 it was agreed by all parties that the player and his representatives would return the following afternoon to complete the transfer in the event of a positive verdict from the medical and the player also resolving his contractual issues with charlton on thursday morning
969283 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
969284 as everybody knows i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream come true
969285 tomorrow afternoon i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
969286 nothing has yet been signed but we expect things to move on during the course of today
969287 our chairman bernd hoffmann held talks with real madrid during the emirates cup
969288 looking back at the last couple of years im extremely happy that ive had the chance to experience playing for hsv
969289 no club and no set of fans will treat you with more hospitality than they do
969290 thanks very much for that his wife sylvie and i will never forget you
969291 only picture of vdv that teamtalk has well atleast its easy to look at d
969292 in the future i think it is necessary we have an exact and precise ruling
969293 it has been decided for 2012 to avoid any misunderstandings and problems plus or not plus three overage players that the whole item of the presence of football in the olympic games shall be discussed immediately after the conclusion of the 2008 olympic games together with the ioc
969294 the discussion will be open and is designed to have a clear and clean situation for everybody for the 2012 olympics which will be played in london
969295 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let the young players have the experience
969296 jurgen klinsmann wrote in his book the moment i received the bronze medal in the olympics in seoul 1988 when germany beat italy it was my number one outstanding emotion
969297 we need the leagues and the clubs but we need players even if the ruling is negative for the players they should stay here they should play here
969298 the 2012 games will be played in london there is another problem there because the four british associations have to put in one team which would be called great britain
969299 it is a unique problem they have four individual associations they have one olympic association
969300 the national olympic committee of great britain tried to ask fifa to make an exception for the womens team who qualified through europe but it was not possible
969301 the first olympic games after the second world war were organised in london there was a british football team there therefore also in 2012 there will be a british team
969302 for us it is not important if the players are all from england
969303 we had a situation where we had set aside this coming saturday for gareth barrys testimonial that obviously is in abeyance
969304 so well get ourselves abroad for a little while and arrange some games to get ourselves prepared for the first leg of the uefa cup qualifier
969305 kirky hurt his back while we were on tour that is a bit of a concern to us
969306 weve also got paul scharner injured at the moment he twisted his ankle in the barnsley game but at the moment we dont think it is too severe
969307 lee cattermole also twisted his ankle at sheffield but we think hell be okay its not a bad one thankfully
969308 it was a good workout and in the last couple of games weve not had any problems scoring goals
969309 it was nice to see zaki come on and score that will have done him good and hopefully there is more to come from him
969310 pre season is all about getting through the games and ill tell you a week on saturday at west ham whether i think we have moulded together nicely
969311 ive been in the game long enough not to get too carried away by friendly results
969312 sometimes you think youre doing great and then you lose your first match of the season
969313 but were looking okay at the moment i was pleased with how daniel de ridder and olivier kapo played at sheffield wednesday

969315 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
969316 ive heard nothing from stoke im at a huge club here and its really going places
969317 you can see the players weve brought in and i think theyre a sign of some big things happening at the football club
969318 im concentrating on being here i want to be part of this football club and what its all about
969319 until anybody tells me different then i really want to be here
969320 i see a lot of potential here it gets harder in the premier league every year but us staying up last year has created the opportunity to bring the players in that we have this year
969321 hopefully we have the platform now to push on and i really want to be a part of that
969322 the new players have not come to be part of a survival scrap they want a lot more than that and so do all of us
969323 we all thought some higher up didnt want to be embarrassed by a bunch of sweaty men dancing together and so had asked them to close it im really pleasantly surprised
969324 sometimes its nice to actually be able to see the guy youre talking to
969325 i wont care one bit if my kids watch porn
969326 al khilafah al khilafah wahai kaum muslim ia kewajiban dari tuhan kalian tempat kemuliaan kalian tempat mengalahkan musuh musuh kalian tempat membebaskan negeri kalian serta mercu suar kebaikdan dan keadilan ke penjuru dunia
969327 dan kami juga telah mengutus luth kepada kaumnya ingatlah tatkala dia berkata kepada kaumnya mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan faahisyah itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelummu
969328 janganlah seorang laki laki melihat aurat laki laki jangan pula perempuan melihat aurat perempuan janganlah seorang laki laki tidur dengan laki laki dalam satu selimut begitu juga janganlah perempuan tidur dengan perempuan dalam satu selimut

969331 pasukan garda revolusi iran baru baru ini telah menguji coba senjata angkatan laut dan mampu menghancurkan kapal selam di kedalaman 300 km bawah laut
969332 senjata itu didesain dan diproduksi dengan teknologi asli dari iran dan belum pernah digunakan oleh negara manapun
969333 posisi pantai dan ketinggiannya sangat mungkin bagi militer iran untuk mampu mengunci dan menutup rapat rapat selat hormouz dan dapat dengan mudah memblokir setiap kapal yang akan melewati selat tersebut
969334 kami menjadi sasaran tudingan di mana mana gara gara pemberitaan media semua orang mencurigai kami seolah olah kami ini pembunuh
969335 kekuatan hizbullah saat ini telah menjadi lebih kuat dari waktu waktu sebelumnya ketika hizbullah lebih kuat maka akan mampu mencegah israel untuk membuka perang baru di kawasan timur tengah kami sesungguhnya tidak ingin memulai perang baru tapi kami harus selalu dalam keadaan siap
969336 kami tidak mengingkari ketergantungan hizbullah terhadap dukungan dan bantuan militer iran hizbullah menyampaikan ucapan terima kasih kepada setiap negara yang telah memberikan dukungan bagi hizbullah
969337 para penelepon itu berbicara dalam bahasa arab dan meminta penduduk lebanon tidak memberi dukungan atau simpati kepada hizbullah jika melakukannya maka israel akan kembali melancarkan serangan militer yang mematikan
969338 perang lebanon kedua telah memukul olmert dan menurunkannya ke tempat yang paling rendah sementara kasus suap adalah pukulan yang membuatnya tko
969339 jika saja perang lebanon hasilnya memuaskan maka kasus suap yang menimpanya tidak akan berhasil menjatuhkan olmert
969340 seandainya perang berakhir dengan kemenangan israel maka olmert akan mampu menghindar desakan kasus suap karena kasus itu bukan kasus yang baru dan sudah diketahui public
969341 olmert telah kehilangan popularitasnya di mata masyarakat setelah kekalahan olmert telah mati pada perang di lebanon dan dikubur dengan kasus suap dan dana bantuan asing
969342 orang yang membunuh apalagi pembunuhan secara berantai menurut islam harus dihukum mati ini bukan kejam tapi pembelaan ham atas orang yang dimatitiinnya
969343 banyak yang bertanya apakah skb ini berarti pembubaran terhadap ahmadiyah saya katakan tidak ada pembubaran ahmadiyah kemudian yang menyangkut masalah pidana terhadap jai tidak ada tapi intinya adalah untuk memberikan peringatan dan perintah kepada penganut ahmadiyah untuk menghentikan kegiatan itu intinya
969344 jadi yang menodai agama pasal 156 a sedangkan yang melakukan kekerasan di depan umum bisa dikenakan pasal 170 bila melakukan kekerasan ancaman hukumannya 5 tahun dan jika menyebabkan luka berat ancaman hukumannya 7 tahun kalau melanggar kerukunan dan keteriban umum bisa mengarah ke pembekuan organisasi massa itu sesuai uu no 8 tahun 1985
969345 tidak hanya per orang tetapi juga organisasi dan badan hukumnya
969346 jadi tidak boleh menghukum sendiri seperti membakar masjidnya dan sebagainya tidak diperkenankan
969347 kami tetap meminta agar pemerintah membubarkan dan melarang ahmadiyah di indonesia ini skb red belum bisa menyelesaikan masalah
969348 mereka tobat dan kembali kepada ajaran islam yang khaffah atau membikin aliran agama sendiri di luar islam seperti di pakistan
969349 skb tentang penghentian kegiatan jai tidak menyelesaikan masalah substansi sebab bagaimana pun bisa dilakukan dalam bentuk aktivitas lain sehingga ajaran menyimpang tersebut dikhawatirkan berlanjut
969350 kalau sudah pada tahap menista melecehkan pemerintah seharusnya tidak hanya sebatas melarang tapi juga membubarkan organisasi ini
969351 bisa saja pemerintah melarang tapi secara diam diam ajaran masih bisa terlaksana
969352 pemerintah hanya menggunakan bahasa diplomatis untuk menenangkan masyarakat tapi kenyataannya ahmadiyah masih hidup
969353 kalau presiden tidak mengeluarkan kepres lebih baik mundur saja seluruh umat islam bukan hanya fpi ingin pembubaran ahmadiyah
969354 kami mungkin akan melakukan langkah hukum lagi berupa peninjauan kembali ke pengadilan dan mungkin judicial review ke mk
969355 tentu kecewa karena kami merasa skb itu tidak sesuai dengan semangat konstitusi
969356 ini kayaknya karena terlalu banyak desakan dari fpi dan kawan kawan ini menunjukkan pemerintah mengeluarkan kebijakan hanya berdasarkan desakan massa
969357 itu kan produk lama dilahirkan dalam demokrasi terpimpin sudah tidak kontekstual dengan negara demokrasi saat ini
969358 selama saya masih hidup saya akan pertahankan gerakan ahmadiyah ngerti nggak ngerti terserah
969359 persoalan ahmadiyah berdasarkan uud 1945 jadi tetap berhak untuk berdiri
969360 kalau ada yang bependapat ahmadiyah salah silakan tapi uud 1945 itu memberi kebebasaan menyatakan pendapat
969361 kami akan melaksanakan ibadah sesuai dengan syariat islam yang diajarkan ahmadiyah
969362 we all can intuitively guess what the problem is someone benefits from the efforts of others without making a similar effort
969363 democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
969364 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
969365 today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes
969366 this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates

969368 the people of miami responded beautifully to this every place that had a drop off we got cans rice dried beans this is particularly important in haiti right now where the food crisis has increased prices by over 100 percent and 80 percent of the population is making under 2 a day which is the reason people are buying clay cookies made literally out of clay bouillon oil and salt

969377 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
969378 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

969441 graffiti is an attack on the community and the environment
969442 it is anti social and destructive and its a crime we take very seriously
969443 i stood there completely baffled for about an hour outside of the tate to tell you the truth
969444 i quite like it but it really confused me a lot i know that half if not all of the graffiti that is on the tate modern building is done by people who do illegal graffiti or have done illegal graffiti and have made their name doing that
969445 it is like theyre saying yeah were on the edge of the law yet were being shown by one of the biggest galleries in london and its sponsored by nissan
969446 if you can make money from illegal graff or a gallery does it off your back then its okay
969447 its in advertising and fashion as well there is graffiti on trainers hoodies hats t shirts everything you can think of people want to wear illegal graffiti that is on the trains and the street
969448 how come you can wear it and buy it use it in advertising marketing music and every album cover and as soon as you do it youre f ed so wheres the message if they dont want people to be involved dont popularise it
969449 i hope that we are there to challenge what people think about street art
969450 i totally understand what i did was vandalism but i like the artistic side of it
969451 there may be some mixed messages in society i think the main thing is that its a real culture difference in some countries it is legal and street art is more accepted brazil for instance is more relaxed about it but in parts of australia they are like the uk and people really hate graffiti and tags on vans and trains but in melbourne van drivers compete with each other as to whose is more decorated
969452 every artist in the street art exhibition has made that leap into galleries but its not a big leap although their art is available to see in the street they also do a lot of studio practise beforehand that is one of the main differences between street art and graffiti most of the artists have a studio and have gone to art school and have had their work in an exhibition
969453 the exhibition in nyc is to give the recognition to the artists that i believe they deserve and to accentuate the fact that they are not at all criminals and do not at all deserve to be put in jail for their creative force
969454 i want to give them a platform to exhibit their art on a
969455 i do not believe the creators of art should be punished but appreciated and celebrated
969456 jailing artists for criminal damage although it may seem to be a deterrent does in fact only serve to gain kudos and notoriety for the artist
969457 this in turn means that the criminal justice system in this case is fundamentally flawed and counter productive
969458 its important that the criminal justice system the courts the judges the police and the greater community understand this and that if they ever really want address graffiti as an issue then we all need to explore avenues together avenues other than jail time
969459 they showed the young people who arent able to do reading or writing that they can use artistic ways to express themselves
969460 their skills are obviously needed it doesnt make sense to send him down we should use it
969461 for the first day we got them sketching to see what they could do and tried to teach them a few different things about how to go about building up a piece
969462 gradually through the week we were getting them painting by the end of the week every single person in the class had a quite sizeable piece and a finished product
969463 they knew i was a writer i said to them the tags i am putting up are the tags i see in london so its realistic and they said great realistic tags just what we want
969464 and they said maybe you could come up with three tags for eastenders you know three writers that are just around the square you could put up east 13 crew one could be rocky they were getting really into it
969465 we knew what we were doing was wrong but when you are painting a piece all your worries just fall away
969466 trains were like a moving canvass it goes underground it goes over bridges and if youre standing there amongst the crowd and you see everyone looking at it it gives you a huge feeling of gratification
969467 we tried to create something that was artistic made people look something thats thought provoking makes commuters look up from their paper
969468 but i dont think i could call myself an artist im a vandal ive admitted that
969469 people are not really educated on the whole graffiti thing but now that banksy has come around people see it as one of the purest art forms which it essentially is and so to that extent i would say that i was an artist
969470 to train writers tags are actually much more valuable to the graffiti community than a banksy painting is
969471 we were all brought together by some sort of passion and this is one of the things that has created stronger bonds between us and perhaps given us richer memories than the average person possesses
969472 it seems to be on the way to being recognised as a valued form of art
969473 but in this case it has been sprayed all over property without their permission thats simply vandalism
969474 ziggy has been sent to prison for 18 months having pleaded guilty to a crime not involving violence terrorism knives or drugs but vandalising public property
969475 british transport police declined to arrest him and others when they knew they were breaking the law presumably to develop their case for this show trial costing the tax payer thousands and thousands of pounds unnecessarily
969476 now they have sent him to jail instead of getting him to do community service for example to clean and help restore the trains and stations
969477 a balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power earning money someone else spends
969478 what a great man he was as a skipper they are huge boots ive got to try and fill
969479 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
969480 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front
969481 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
969482 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
969483 signs and symptoms of early local lyme disease often start with flu like feeling of headache stiff neck fever muscle aches and fatigue
969484 at least one antlerless deer must be taken on private lands in bedford fairfax fauquier franklin loudoun patrick prince william or roanoke counties before the second antlered deer of the license year may be taken on private lands in any of these counties furthermore at least two antlerless deer must have been taken on private lands in bedford fairfax fauquier franklin loudoun patrick or prince william counties before the third antlered deer of the license year may be taken on private lands in any of these counties
969485 the departments deer management plan calls for deer populations to be reduced in all these counties and traditional liberal deer regulations have not effectively achieved that objective in fact deer populations in several of these counties have increased eab has been demonstrated in several other states to be an effective management tool to control and reduce deer numbers

969533 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
969534 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
969535 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

969547 philanthropy markets have a number of significant advantages over traditional nonprofits but they will need to find ways to increase the amount of information available to donors and lenders if they are going to continue to grow cell phones may become the portal through which the third world participates in philanthropy markets as the facebook craigslist generation becomes a larger part of the donor community they may be willing to exchange the radical efficiencies of the marketplace approach for a less perfect retrospective craigslist like approach to fraud if more transaction data is hosted on servers located in the developed world there may be enough market data to use the same computerized techniques the credit card companies use today to spot fraud kiva and donorschoose captured the imagination of the folks at our event i think because most people instinctively believe that the immediacy and emotional power of engaging directly with a borrower or recipient and the inherent efficiency of a lean market place approach to philanthropy already outweigh the risks and that the balance between opportunity and risk will shift further to opportunity as information and information technology becomes more broadly distributed in the developing world

969655 hsbc has performed well in 2008 relative to other banks
969656 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cutting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
969657 there can be no prospect of a fundamental recovery in this business regardless of what the us property market does unless hsbc addresses the main problem which is households unsustainable capital structure
969658 the best value we can get from the us business is to recover the value attributed to it in the stock price there is a strong underlying credit card business and consumer finance business but our job is to make sure the platform is maintained so that when us conditions recover we can capitalise on that
969659 we expect an orderly run off of about 80pc of the portfolio of 13bn to be achieved in three years with the remaining balance trailing off after that time
969660 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices and we have recognised this with an impairment charge of 527m on the goodwill
969661 lower than in the second half of 2007 by 17pc
969662 the underlying problem areas in relation to credit have worked their way through the book the issue now is the us slowdown and whether it enters a technical recession and what that does to the credit card and unsecured books
969663 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty globally consumer confidence is declining and the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
969664 the uk and other economies in europe have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process

969680 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
969681 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday
969682 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
969683 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
969684 kevins a great player a strong character in the dressing room
969685 hes a very fine player in both forms of the game hes a very determined and single minded man who knows what he wants kevin has a lot of qualities that people want in a captain he is a good lad hes a very motivated person
969686 i think the side have got to move forward and by appointing me as captain i dont think that would be a good option there are other people out there that could do a better job
969687 its disappointing the way in which hes gone out it would have been nice if he had gone out on a high hes a fine player and hes someone who will score a lot more runs for england im sure
969688 hamilton has been racing since he was a child he has had bad turns hes had adversity and hes had some more in hungary
969689 but he finished in the points and hes still leading the world championship he will recover from this it has happened to him before and it will happen to him again
969690 i never thought id see juan manuel fangios record beaten but michael schumacher beat it
969691 and it is not beyond the realms of possibility that schumachers record which i thought was unbeatable could be beaten in time by hamilton hes that good
969692 hamiltons a racer he doesnt back off if he wants to be in a spot hell go there he just wont give up he can pull off some incredible passes and hes a winner
969693 i personally think hes going to dominate things the way that schumacher did i hope he doesnt because it would not be good for the sport but looking at him now youd have to think that

969854 die qualit t des bildungsangebots in rheinland pfalz wird mit einer reihe von ma nahmen die im heute beginnenden schuljahr 2008 2009 starten konsequent weiterentwickelt basis daf r ist eine gute unterrichtsversorgung die durch die erfolgreiche arbeit der schulaufsicht und nicht zuletzt mit hilfe von 220 zus tzlich im landeshaushalt bereitgestellten lehrerstellen gesichert wird zum 1 august konnten auf den neuen und den freigewordenen stellen rund 950 lehrkr fte neu eingestellt werden f r dieses schuljahr sind zudem mehr als 100 lehrerinnen und lehrer im vorgriff bereits zum 1 februar eingestellt worden besonders wichtig ist uns dass sich alle neuerungen und reformen die initiiert werden in ein bergreifendes bildungspolitisches gesamtkonzept einpassen das die chancen von sch lerinnen und sch lern w hrend der schulzeit und auch mit blick auf den weiteren ausbildungs und lebensweg verbessert und die individuelle f rderung in den mittelpunkt stellt
969855 wir haben uns in rheinland pfalz ganz bewusst daf r entschieden den achtj hrigen gymnasialen bildungsgang nicht verpflichtend sondern als angebot einzuf hren und ihn mit der ganztagsschule zu verkn pfen damit soll m glichst vielen kindern der weg zum abitur und damit dann auch die chance zu einem hochschulstudium offengehalten werden
969856 sehr erfreulich ist dass sich die bildung von rhythmisierten ganztagsklassen immer weiter verbreitet etwa 40 prozent aller schulen organisieren ihr angebot jetzt ber ganztagsklassen was die chancen steigert den unterrichtstag noch besser im wechsel zwischen lern bungs und entspannungsphasen zu gestalten

969860 damit sollen sowohl sch lerinnen und sch ler die derzeit hauptschulen besuchen als auch jetzige realsch lerinnen und realsch ler zus tzliche f rderangebote und mehr chancen zu h heren schulabschl ssen erhalten angesichts der wachsenden nachfrage nach h herwertigen qualifikationen auf dem arbeitsmarkt wird das die perspektiven der sch lerinnen und sch ler im land insgesamt verbessern

969899 when i was playing for manchester united before i broke my leg i was playing in central midfield
969900 i then missed 18 months with my injury and when sam allardyce brought me to newcastle he played me all over that never really helps you it doesnt allow you to become consistent and it doesnt really allow you to become settled the gaffer knows where he wants to play me and if hes going to play me up there im going to have to start scoring goals im going to have to start playing as a centre forward like i did when i was at leeds and like i did when i first went to united i know i can do that id enjoy an extended run at centre forward and i think everyone knows thats probably my best position its whats natural to me but if im going to play there and stay in the team im going to have to score goals

969910 there is a greater pressure on banks to explore new business models that meet evolving customer demands and requirements and being able to use diverse tools such as personalized homepages social networks rss and gives financial services firms a significant advantage as long as they meet strict corporate security and governance requirements
969911 banks and financial institutions are currently trying to prune the cost of customer support as well as enhance the level of promotion of new services to small business and corporate customers and web 2 0 technology is able to satisfy both these needs with much higher degrees of business interaction which increases the likelihood customers will do more business with their existing institution
969912 celents report concludes quite rightly that whilst business banking online services provide a raft of services they look and feel out of date and are not what todays customers are really after in the web 2 0 driven e business world
969913 banks have been holding back from embracing web 2 0 technology and its attendant advantages because of uncertainty on how to implement these solutions with enterprise grade security

969918 in judah god is known his name is great in israel in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion
969919 there is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high
969920 his foundation is in the holy mountains the lord loves the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob glorious things of thee are spoken zion city of god
969921 the joy of the whole earth the city of the great king
969922 the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob
969923 but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there
969924 in judah is god known his name is great in israel in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion
969925 the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people
969926 for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest for ever here will i dwell for i have desired it
969927 blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelleth at jerusalem
969928 as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever
969929 god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early
969930 and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god
969931 blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth
969932 nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david
969933 then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriyah in the place that david had prepared in threshing floor of ornan the jebusite
969934 for now i have chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
969935 and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation is nigh
969936 jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
969937 and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it
969938 behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about
969939 and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people
969940 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months
969941 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem
969942 for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle
969943 and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced
969944 in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
969945 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance
969946 behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him
969947 one hundred senators 435 congressmen one president and nine supreme court justices 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly legally morally and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country

969976 initially following the federal reserves interest rate cuts our variable rate loans repriced immediately while our time deposits have been repricing as they mature the growing levels of non maturity deposits generated through our expanded branch network as well as the substantial level of time deposits that will mature and reprice at considerably lower rates in july and august should begin to strengthen our net interest margin
969977 while we continue to face economic pressures we are confident that this region has a vibrant future and will recover over time cape fear bank has established an excellent reputation in our community and has a strong foundation upon which to build our future together

969980 we are excited to announce that we recently received notice of a design win from one of the largest enterprise storage and server oems confirming our qualification across multiple platforms using our zeusiops and mach8 iops ssds
969981 we expect production revenue from these platforms to begin in the fourth quarter of this year this is our second large enterprise oem customer win we are in the later stages of qualification for our zeusiops ssds with several other key enterprise storage customers in addition we are in the later stages of qualification with several leading enterprise server oems for our mach8 iops ssd products we anticipate that we will be announcing additional qualifications at other major enterprise oems by the end of this year further we expect that both of these product lines will contribute significantly to our growth in 2009
969982 our mlc based products have now been qualified at a number of leading notebook and the ultra mobile notebook oems we believe the current environment of falling nand flash prices will help to further reduce the price of ssds to the end customer and stimulate demand in both of these markets we expect to begin shipping production units into these markets in third quarter of 2008
969983 we increased our inventory significantly in the second quarter of 2008 primarily as the result of the procurement of 40 million in nand flash components in response to customer forecasts and orders related to new product launches set for the second half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we believe that these purchases will enable us to have sufficient inventory to meet our pricing obligations and secure our gross margins on sales related to these product launches this was a necessary and precautionary measure to avert price fluctuation risk and to ensure that supply is available when needed over the next several quarters we expect our inventory dsos to decrease
969984 we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2008 having surpassed our second quarter revenue and non gaap diluted earnings per share guidance the execution of our solid state drive initiatives in four major markets enterprise storage enterprise server notebook and ultra mobile notebook positively impacted second quarter of 2008 results and we expect continued growth in subsequent quarters in addition we have recently closed a 35 million revolving credit facility this facility will add to our liquidity and enable us to manage the future growth of our business furthermore this financing comes with a relatively low cost of capital and is considerably less dilutive to our shareholders than an equity offering
969985 we currently expect third quarter of 2008 revenue to range from 61 million to 63 million with diluted non gaap earnings per share to range from 0 10 to 0 11 additionally in light of our mounting design win activity at key customers we believe we will continue to have strong performance into the fourth quarter of 2008 with double digit growth from the third quarter of 2008 this momentum will carry us into the first quarter of 2009 and even beyond
