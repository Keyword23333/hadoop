4280000 the obama campaign has made no significant headway among former clinton backers over the past two months the voting preferences of clintons supporters are virtually identical to earlier polls in june and july
4280001 that people want to feel like o k its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4280002 you dont want a situation where anybody feels theyve been cheated

4280005 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
4280006 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
4280007 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
4280008 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
4280009 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
4280010 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
4280011 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
4280012 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
4280013 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
4280014 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
4280015 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
4280016 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
4280017 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
4280018 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street

4280040 one year when i was in the minors i started getting ready for spring training on nov 1
4280041 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4280042 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4280043 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4280044 this is what weve been looking forward to weve been talking about this day its pretty neat
4280045 what better place to do it for the first time then in the big leagues
4280046 im going to throw it in the dirt see what hes got and test him out ill get him
4280047 he wants to be great hes always asking questions always studying film he tried to learn the entire offense in the first day and then was frustrated when he didnt have it down
4280048 when you get a new guy that comes in thats so hungry to learn so hungry to be ready to play and contribute its great
4280049 its always great to start a season like that to connect with the team to connect with carson
4280050 i dont think the green bay fans were too happy they thought i was heckling them but i was pointing to my family
4280051 if youve got two tight ends that can stretch the field or block it really puts the defense in a situation where they never know if youre going to run or pass

4280075 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4280076 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income
4280077 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated for or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
4280078 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4280079 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4280080 the high quality drug treatment that is being provided is the most effective way of reducing illegal drug misuse improving the physical and mental health of drug users as well as reducing the harm they cause to themselves and society
4280081 clearly too few people who misuse drugs are being identified and admitted to drug rehabilitation courses early on which has contributed to this worrying rise in admissions to hospitals
4280082 as drugs get stronger the harm they are doing to young peoples mental health is increasing the government needs to wake up to the scale of the problem
4280083 more than twice as many young men were admitted as young women which suggests men may be more likely to self medicate with illicit drugs to manage their emotional distress many of these admissions may be related to other pre existing mental health problems such as depression or feelings of alienation for which we need much earlier intervention and support when families and others express their concerns

4280155 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4280156 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4280157 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4280158 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4280159 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4280160 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4280161 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4280162 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4280163 and this girl had the biggest rack you ever saw
4280164 almost every car i see in a traffic jam has a tomtom

4280166 i have never told anyone this not even my daughter
4280167 but all of my life i have never known how to pray at church i used to hear the pastor talk about prayer but it went right over my head
4280168 until one day four years ago my best friend said to me
4280169 sit down in a chair place an empty chair in front of you and in faith see jesus on the chair
4280170 then just speak to him in the same way youre doing with me right now
4280171 so i tried it and ive liked it so much that i do it a couple of hours every day im careful though if my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair shed either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm

4280174 esta prohibici n debe eliminarse inmediatamente para que las organizaciones de ayuda puedan llevar a cabo su labor y evitar una cat strofe humanitaria

4280181 if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time
4280182 that is what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what nixon did with mao what reagan did with gorbachev
4280183 paul nitze the assistant secretary of defense said the meeting was just a disaster
4280184 in january 2007 he introduced legislation in the senate to remove all of our combat troops from iraq by march 2008

4280187 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided

4280189 h e used a word to represent what he did not want to see again and then realized afterwards that that word is a code word in the middle east
4280190 i do believe obama is like john kennedy a great man with a great principle and he has a vision to change america to make it in a position to lead the world community but not with humiliation and arrogance
4280191 we all agree that john kennedy was a great president and its flattering when anybody says that barack obama would follow in his footsteps
4280192 i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt out as leverage
4280193 im a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
4280194 i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother
4280195 his comments were not only divisive and destructive but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate and i believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church
4280196 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial
4280197 sen barack obama was the most liberal senator in 2007
4280198 the ratings system devised in 1981 under the direction of william schneider a political analyst and commentator and a contributing editor to national journal also assigns composite scores an average of the members issue based scores
4280199 california has a spending problem not a revenue problem the itunes and internet tax bills illustrate a complete disregard for sustaining a healthy and vibrant business climate in california these measures stem from an arrogant assumption that the government must find a way to tax because of overspending legislators own fiscal irresponsibility in order for our state to retain our global leadership edge in digital media and the online market we must maintain competitive pricing this measure penalizes companies who operate and provide jobs in california by crippling them with added taxes
4280200 the potential legal implications of texting while driving go far beyond the possibility of a mere traffic violation
4280201 yeah i text all the time when im driving especially when ive got a bud light in the cup holder and im watching a dvd on my hacked avic n3
4280202 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4280203 of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4280204 the topaz solar farm will grow clean electricity on previously disturbed unused farmland with low profile panels minimizing visual impact
4280205 its designed to be compatible with key wildlife species and avoid
4280206 we are now here with technology available now that will allow solar to take its place among central station power plants with wind geothermal gas and coal
4280207 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4280208 thats really good news because the department of energy predicts we will need 386 gigawatts by 2015 just to keep up with load growth this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future
4280209 we talked about features like adaptive streaming the ability to automatically keep checking how much bandwidth you have and deliver the appropriate quality stream and how to be smart about knowing whats coming up in the stream
4280210 in the last several days more than 50 of the visitors to nbcolympics com on msn already have silverlight 2 installed
4280211 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4280212 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4280213 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4280214 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4280215 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4280216 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4280217 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4280218 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
4280219 a method of using high quality photographs to enhance a video taken of the same subject the project page gives a good overview of what they are doing and the video on the page gives some really nice examples of how their technology works hopefully someone can take the technology and run with it but one things for sure this could make amateur video making look even better than it does now
4280220 4 could the work be reproduced by one or more skilled graduate students are all important algorithmic or system details discussed adequately are the limitations and drawbacks of the work clear
4280221 i was at his mercy and if i fought back i got hit harder
4280222 it was a variety of horror it was like a bad dream it was like a horror story a bad dream
4280223 why did you drag us out of bed to this hideous hellhole in the middle of the night i hope for your sake you have a damn good reason you can start by telling me why you were her in the first place
4280224 when i was here yesterday with agent barrow i could have sworn i saw one of the victims move their hand i couldnt get the feeling of what i saw out of my head i came back to see if i could see any more movement when i got here the place was abandoned and the power was off the doors to all the cells were wide open and the patients that once occupied those cells were nowhere to be found i went into the isolation wing and found that the beds once filled with the victims were empty the infected patients were up and roaming the hospital one of them attacked me i managed to get out and called you immediately
4280225 it attacked me threw me to the ground and tried to pummel me as you can see by the bruise on my face it managed to land one shot i punched it in the head and managed to escape
4280226 why do you keep saying it not he or she
4280227 what attacked me is no longer human i dont have the words to explain all that i saw in there you really need to see it for yourself
4280228 okay marley theres nothing here where is this amazing thing that we are supposed to see why dont you tell me what really happened here
4280229 id think it would be fairly obvious that im telling the truth considering the patients are not anywhere in this room what do you think happened here that i somehow made them magically disappear
4280230 all i know is you called us down here and tell us that the patients have awakened from their catatonia and that one even attacked you but when we arrive there isnt a damn thing here including the patients you are hiding something

4280235 i couldnt take that shit any longer i cant deal with brawler and kaiser fucking with me every day trying to ruin my life im done with it
4280236 i understand that and dont blame you a bit thats not what i meant theres something else something to do with what you saw inside i do believe that you saw something
4280237 you are like a large print book a blind person could read you
4280238 i cant tell you right now i have to be absolutely certain before i mention this to anyone and right now im not completely convinced

4280243 were pushing the academic growth of every kid at the higher levels i think that more than anything else makes a difference in the performance of this district
4280244 the only way these young people have a future is if we succeed not only in educating them but educating them at higher levels
4280245 given all that we do have a cost overrun but we also have interest that the bond amount citizens approved has been earning so our plan is to use that interest earned to cover that overage
4280246 mccain calls for 700 new nuclear plants and seven yucca mountains costing 4 trillion
4280247 she swore by it as did another friend of mine
4280248 i dont think there is a housing analyst around who doesnt think that there is at least 15 percent of downside still to come
4280249 people make decisions to buy homes for a variety of reasons
4280250 some of those reasons may transcend the fact that you are going to lose some value
4280251 there may be a house that is the perfect house for you in which case maybe its worthwhile buying it
4280252 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4280253 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4280254 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4280255 cedia expo is the largest trade show in this industry and we all want to come away from it with our pockets filled with leads of interested integrators whove visited our booths
4280256 but what about the thousands of integrators who attended the show but didnt have a chance to visit with you
4280257 but we dont just have a database we maintain that database as well something that is especially important since email addresses change so frequently companies that try to maintain their databases themselves frequently find that the email addresses they have are no longer valid our integrator database is a living entity and we keep it at 10 000 integrators
4280258 this new custom program includes newsletter creation spam filter testing database blasts forensic analysis and more based on client needs
4280259 the most fun is when you see the kids who are hearing their mothers voice for the first time
4280260 its a teaching hospital that trains nurses i told them i was an audiologist and would be happy to do some training with their medical technicians or whatever the need might be
4280261 i showed them a hearing aid they had never seen one
4280262 i was able to dispense hearing aids out of the handful i brought the first person to receive an aid was an orphaned boy
4280263 it was poorly planned children who cant speak or hear portuguese are being mainstreamed
4280264 its not unusual to have a 21 year old in the first grade to be promoted you have to speak and write portuguese and thats not going to happen for these children
4280265 the most fun is when you see the kids who are hearing their mothers voice for the first time
4280266 i have not loved you with my whole heart and i have not loved my neighbor as my self
4280267 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god a thing to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very form of a servant and being made in human likeness and being found in apperance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even death on a cross
4280268 lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4280269 if they werent willing to meet those demands they shouldnt have drafted him
4280270 sticking to this sanctified slotting position theyve made their position clear throughout negotiations about their adherence to the slotting system
4280271 i would doubt they sign aaron crow because i guarantee we wont change
4280272 the end of the issue will be to have someone buy these houses and take care of the pools properly
4280273 its been an awesome year and winning the mvp is the icing on the cake
4280274 this individual award is great but definitely not my focus my focus from the beginning is to help the team grow try to make sta lucia a force
4280275 we saw it flourish and yield so much and now its harvest time
4280276 it is possible we may have to increase it to more than that it just depends on how the financial situation develops
4280277 i dont know any organization that faces the kind of budget challenges were facing that doesnt take a serious look at right sizing itself
4280278 we need to drill down and give some thought to whether our government is the right size or not
4280279 i had a department director come in yesterday who said i really need three computers
4280280 the bottom line is whatever is essential to the education of our students were doing our best not to touch that
4280281 whenever you have a budget that is 80 percent personnel services any significant cut is going to impact some of our service delivery and our ability to operate some of our facilities
4280282 we have told the staff that their jobs are being reassigned to atlanta
4280283 its a very bad expenditure of resources but the alternative is for them to lose their jobs
4280284 the backlogs going to increase you cannot cut a budget without cutting staff
4280285 im desperately trying to figure out why kamikaze pilots wore helmets
4280286 where in the world would i buy be able to buy a seemingly comfortable pair of used panties if i was so inclined
4280287 make no mistake as you change your leadership style to one of a coach you will face challenges there will be times when you question why am i doing this however you must at all times keep the long term benefits of being a coach at the forefront of your mind
4280288 remember friends as you pass by as you are now so once was i as low as i you once must be prepare yourself and follow me
4280289 a brother is not always a friend but a friend is always a brother
4280290 a mirror reflects a mans face but what he is really like is shown by the kind of friends he chooses
4280291 i find it laughable that nationwide should call it a technical department as in my experience the only technical advice it provides is that one should re register
4280292 i began to realise that i could re register for the rest of my life without a solution
4280293 they rushed in like they had to go to the bathroom or something
4280294 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4280295 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income
4280296 many different knowledge communities that spring up around these cult movies to display their expertise
4280297 no film can be experienced with fresh eyes all are read against other movies
4280298 this is such a great site that i have been known to sneak into an internet cafe while out writing and check a fact
4280299 the book at the heart of this case has overstepped a boundary so unreasonably that i have been forced regretfully to take legal action
4280300 argue they shouldnt be expected to follow the same ethics codes journalists are but responsible bloggers should recognize that they are publishing words publicly and therefore have certain ethical obligations to their readers the people they write about and society in general
4280301 bloggers who adopt this code of principles and these standards of practice not only practice ethical publishing but convey to their readers that they can be trusted
4280302 it might imply that the internet as a whole is some kind of untamed frontier
4280303 in our post were going to look at one condition under which unix and linux operating systems can actually hold onto
4280304 i have written on other occasions you can learn more seeing errors others commit whatever their cause which can be
4280305 for todays post were going to look at using grep to reduce script bloat of course we wont be covering every using bash to feed command output to a while loop without using
4280306 firewall builder fwbuilder is a graphical application that can help you to configure ip traffic filtering
4280307 how many times has this happened to you you want to access a remote server but you cant because it is behind a firewall i frequently if chinas great firewall is so effective why cant it stop all
4280308 go here and then put your mouse in the bottom right corner then click sustainable design and then click burlington 05 and youll see the project
4280309 yes i do it every day but i only listen to it
4280310 ok well im going to have to ask you to find a podcast for this or something because even if youre not watching the video feed it is taking up bandwidth for the rest of the office oh and it also means that youre watching tv all day at work

4280315 i really appreciate it but the doctor says my body was rejecting your kidney
4280316 oh i thought you were looking for a faster machine so that you could get more work done in less time i totally misunderstood your request typically the flat screens go to the autocad people first but i will see what i can do

4280323 stil maar meisje stil maar het is jouw schuld niet
4280324 kom op sjoerd jij hebt toch ook wel wat te vertellen
4280325 een paar jaar geleden was ik op zeilvakantie in thailand we waren met een hele groep en zeilden elke dag op kleine bootjes een stuk verder mijn vriendin sietske en ik zeilden die dag samen op een valk meestal zaten we met drie of vier man op een boot maar vandaag kwam het toevallig zo uit dat wij met zn twee n overbleven omdat we allebei goed konden zeilen vond de leiding dat wel verantwoord ik was een beetje chagrijnig die ochtend ik had te weinig geslapen had een beetje een kater en het waaide ook nog eens nauwelijks zodat we amper vooruit kwamen uit het vooronder pakte ik de thermosfles met koffie ik nam een slok maar wist niet hoe snel ik die weer uit moest spugen oude koude koffie van gisteren getverdemme sietske moest lachen ieder ander die het nu gewaagd zou hebben me uit te lachen zou ik direct overboord gekieperd hebben maar sietske niet ze lachte zo mooi en ondanks mijn chagrijnige bui voelde ik me ineens supergelukkig met haar dit was hoe ik haar het mooist vond in haar korte broek bikinitopje haar blonde haar in een staartje geen make up op ze was prachtig sietske en ik kenden elkaar van de sneekweek waar we allebei mee vaarden op n van de sk tsjes de vonk sprong over en we zijn nooit meer bij elkaar weggegaan een jaar eerder hadden we een oude valk gekocht die we met wat hulp van mijn broer helemaal opgeknapt hebben we hadden daar al heel wat tochtjes mee gemaakt over de friese meren maar nu leek het ons leuk om eens in een hele andere omgeving te gaan varen en dat werd dus thailand we schoten nog steeds voor geen meter op de wind leek eigenlijk alleen maar zwakker te worden sjoerd als jij nou eens even in de zeilen blaast misschien komen we dan wel vooruit grapte sietske ze moest alweer lachen mijn lieve mooie sietske maar ineens betrok haar gezicht ze keek naar iets in de verte wat is er vroeg ik haar je ziet eruit alsof het monster van loch ness naar thailand gekomen is ik vond mijn eigen opmerking erg grappig maar sietske bleef stil ze was flink gekleurd door de zon de afgelopen week maar nu was ze ineens lijkbleek dit leek toch wel serieus ik draaide me om om te zien waar ze nou zo van geschrokken was en ook ik viel stil hoewel ons stukje zee nog zonnig en windstil was kwam er vanuit de verte een dik pak donkergrijze bijna zwarte wolken in een enorm tempo onze kant op en dat niet alleen de zee leek er compleet op hol geslagen we waren een flink eind uit de branding maar niet ver bij ons vandaan ontstonden enorme brekende golven en ze kwamen onze kant op we konden het nu ook goed horen dit was niet zomaar een storm dit was alsof er een oorlog plaatsvond onder de zeespiegel ook bij ons begon het nu te waaien te stormen over het bulderende geluid van de storm riep ik naar sietske omlaag die zeilen moeten eraf en als een gek begon ik de schoten los te knopen eerst de fok naar beneden het was haast niet te doen hij klapperde als een gek tegen me aan ik zat op handen en knie n op het voordek en hield me vast aan de stag de storm werd wilder en wilder ik had de fok gestreken niet zoals jullie dat geleerd hebben maar hij was los ik kon hem ook niet meer vasthouden dus toen ik hem eenmaal los had vloog hij zijn vrijheid tegemoet binnen no time was de fok uit het zicht verdwenen maar veel tijd om daar aandacht aan te besteden had ik niet ik moest sietske helpen die met het grootzeil aan het ploeteren was door de harde storm waren de schoten in de war geraakt en bleef het zeil halverwege steken ik moest in de mast klimmen om hem los te krijgen sietske smeekte me om het niet te doen het was te gevaarlijk daar had ze gelijk in maar in deze storm met half gehesen zeil midden op zee blijven was nog veel gevaarlijker dacht ik ik klom naar boven voor zover dat ging sietske probeerde de giek in bedwang te houden maar dat ging natuurlijk voor geen meter de schoten waren nog meer in de knoop geraakt dan ik al gedacht had en het leek uren te duren voor ik ze los had door de hoge golven hing ik steeds bijna horizontaal boven het water hing het was een wonder dat we niet gekapseisd waren ik heb hem los schreeuwde ik naar sietske hij is los ze keek naar boven haar aandacht verslapte even ik keek haar recht in haar ogen toen een windvlaag het zeil te pakken kreeg en er een enorme ruk aan gaf ik verloor bijna mijn evenwicht en hield me stevig vast aan de mast sietske pas op riep ik maar het was te laat ik zag het gebeuren wat in werkelijkheid een fractie van een seconde was leek minutenlang door te gaan de giek knalde met een rotvaart tegen sietskes bovenlijf en door de kracht ervan werd ze als een lappen pop het kolkende water ingeslingerd zo snel als ik kon klauterde ik naar beneden ik keek of ik haar zag maar ze was nergens te bekennen ik tuurde en tuurde maar nergens zag ik mijn meisje ik bleef haar maar roepen sietske sietske maar dat had geen enkele zin mijn stem werd direct meegevoerd met de storm toen zag ik haar haar hand kwam steeds heel even boven het water uit ze was niet ver weg en ik het lukte me om de boom los te maken van de mast ik reikte ermee naar haar siets pak em vast ze greep de boom en ik begon haar richting de boot te trekken ze was er bijna ik keek haar aan en stak mijn hand uit onze vingers raakten elkaar op een centimeter na toen de grootste golf tot dan toe ons greep de boot werd keihard meegevoerd en ik kon me nog net vasthouden sietske verloor haar grip vanuit mijn ooghoeken zag ik haar verdwijnen in de verte in de diepte van de zee ik werd honderden meters meegesleurd op de golf en kwam uiteindelijk op het strand terecht door die klap raakte ik bewusteloos ik moet er een paar uur gelegen hebben want toen ik bijkwam was de zee weer net zo rustig als die ochtend toen we vertrokken de ravage van kapot gewaaide huizen en versplinterde boten was het enige bewijs van de storm huilende mensen liepen over het strand ze zochten hun spullen en hun geliefden het duurde even tot het tot me doordrong ik moest k zoeken ik was mijn sietske kwijt ik kon de kracht niet opbrengen mijn hele lijf deed pijn ik was kapot you need help vroeg een oud vrouwtje aan me in gebroken engels ik ik weet het niet ze keek me vragend aan en ik realiseerde me dat ik nederlands tegen haar gesproken had my girlfriend shes gone het vrouwtje hielp me overeind en nam me mee naar n van de weinige huizen die overeind gebleven waren daar zaten nog veel meer toeristen ik herkende wat mensen uit onze groep maar sietske was er niet en ze zou ook niet komen ze was meegenomen door de zee
4280326 this study shows that further optimization of platelet aggregation inhibition with early use of a glycoprotein iib iiia blocker before percutaneous coronary intervention is beneficial
4280327 the iib iiia blocker should not be restricted to patients with complications after percutaneous coronary intervention even in a setting in which high dose clopidogrel is given well in advance of pci
4280328 much of the efficacy of tirofiban in this study might be related to the short time between the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and the administration of the study drug
4280329 on time 2 tells us more than the benefit of high dose tirofiban in primary pci
4280330 the study reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the need for fast and strong platelet inhibition
4280331 it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical
4280332 until now only well organized prehospital systems have been able to provide such a service

4280334 in choosing between the two if tolerability is an issue certainly the angiotensin receptor blocker would be preferred to the ace inhibitor
4280335 there is no evidence to support the use of combination therapy in any subgroup of patients included in ontarget beyond lowering of urinary albumin excretion
4280336 the interpretation that the group receiving a combination regimen ramipril and telmisartan to block the renin angiotensin system group had more renal events istroubling

4280354 in leigh you can find somewhere to park and its absolutely busy on a saturday afternoon but in rayleigh its dead
4280355 theres nothing different here in terms of shops compared with leigh
4280356 rayleigh used to be so lovely but now there are no independent shops or places to browse and nowhere to sit outside
4280357 i think little high streets like rayleigh will disappear into oblivion
4280358 this year has been the hardest ive had since ive been in business
4280359 its a sign of the times the road being dug up hasnt helped
4280360 lots of shops here are on the verge of closing town centres should be the hub of what goes on in communities
4280361 from designer clothes to new cars china is getting rich democracies once bragged that theirs was the only way to economic success china is doing it the communist way
4280362 monsieur labb i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
4280363 do you remember where we were last year on this night
4280364 we dont have 5 000 to lay our hands on to cover anything else

4280372 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4280373 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4280374 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4280375 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4280376 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4280377 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4280378 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4280379 changing the way people work especially with collaboration technology as a foundation beyond having a group of people in different locations and sharing documents
4280380 a bit more users a bit less vendors a bit more fireside chats a bit less panels
4280381 a lot of people talk about us and say we play good football
4280382 good football is good but we didnt win anything last season and you play to win what we are going to keep in our heads is that playing good football is good but sometimes you have to be tough on the pitch to win a game
4280383 we have learned a lot of things sometimes you have to be dirty to win some games against twente we didnt play good football we certainly didnt play our best but we won 2 0 and thats what its all about sometimes you have to forget about playing beautiful football and just make sure you win
4280384 we finished four points behind the champions two behind the runners up and if you see the way that we went out of the champions league it means that if we can keep on going like last year but have a bit more concentration we can do something good
4280385 i think if we have a bit more heart in the game then we have a chance of winning something for sure
4280386 you just have to trust the squad and trust the players the boss brings in
4280387 if you look at someone like nasri he has a lot of ability and is one of the most talented players in france we have to believe in him and let him show what he can do in england we should not be complaining about the injuries ars ne is not complaining the most important thing is to play our football and prove that we have the mentality to beat people

4280390 by waiting until 2011 to start looking for tenants a year before we finish the project we will be further into the recovery and should get higher rates
4280391 57 000 square metres of the highest quality office space
4280392 today you would never start such a big project without a tenant already lined up the economics are not attractive enough
4280393 its already happening but in a less public way than with leadenhall street
4280394 by the first quarter of 2012 we hope it will be done and dusted
4280395 if the economy is to grow then employment needs to grow so we need to create more space for people to work
4280396 if we dont want to build on green fields then we need to get more people into the same space and that means taller buildings
4280397 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4280398 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4280399 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4280400 i dont remotely claim its a discovery of mine but i was genuinely shocked when i first saw it because i had never seen it in any academic biography of kafka the experts conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious
4280401 outrageous and extraordinary the holocaust happened after his death so its ridiculous to talk of his works in that light
4280402 we are devastated and furious but at the same time happy
4280403 finally the literary stylite has fallen from his pedestal and is as much a sinner as you or i
4280404 when gregor samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin
4280405 la charla con simeone fue cortita le dije lo que sent a l lo entendi y me dijo que le d para adelante que hable con los dirigentes y si estaba todo arreglado que le meta y tenga mucha suerte
4280406 organiza tus fotograf as en vistosas presentaciones y s belas a internet
4280407 we talk about it all the time but its really really true
4280408 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4280409 they really believe because of their age and agility that that makes up for lack of experience that their reflexes are faster and theyre stronger physically
4280410 and so they believe theyre better drivers in fact than older people who have a lot more experience
4280411 it shows them first hand that this too could happen to you
4280412 with all the work that weve done with teens this is really reinforcing what they tell us anecdotally
4280413 they do have a feeling that theyre invincible its always someone else whos the bad driver not them and its really difficult to get them to understand the consequences of bad choices
4280414 you cant just have a program for the teens you cant just show it to them once
4280415 but when you look at it very carefully its usually not bad luck its usually someone has made a bad choice someone has chosen to drink and drive chosen not to wear seatbelts or to speed or be out on a lake at midnight when theres no light
4280416 so its never just one person who loses their life its the whole family losing a child losing a loved one losing a parent it is tragic and it shakes the whole family and they never ever recover
4280417 we do call on russia to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
4280418 i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4280419 clearly it would be inappropriate in the circumstances based on russias breach of territorial integrity in georgia
4280420 its important to stand strong with our allies in sending a message that based on that type of aggressive behaviour we will not participate in that exercise
4280421 its a message that says the world is noticing your actions
4280422 in my judgment this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4280423 almost every car i see in a traffic jam has a tomtom

4280425 hes never read novels hes read one in his life its the catcher in the rye and he cant go straight from the catcher in the rye to me because thats not fair
4280426 and then he can read mine he doesnt have the concentration span to read a novel
4280427 but very quickly it all became the same so slight and so annoying and cutesy i wanted to do something that was more grown up and funnier in a spikier way rather than a girly way im not a girly girl at all
4280428 i spent my whole childhood trying to find places to be on my own i used to sit on the water tank in the attic or in the dogs kennel i was quite a strange child
4280429 i am by nature quite self contained and shy and i would generally just sit in a room on my own and not speak
4280430 the feature i hate most about myself is my self consciousness and i was too self conscious to show anybody i never had the confidence in myself i had to leave my job and shame myself into doing it by telling everybody i was off to write a novel i gave myself a year and if nothing happened i thought id go back to work luckily penguin picked it up
4280431 i have occasionally thought people were digging at that and that does upset me i have gone out of my way to try and do it in the proper way
4280432 im not na ve i know the guardian probably wouldnt speak to me at this point in my career if it werent for him but im not generally one of those people who would just witter on about my relationship in real life it doesnt bother me at all that im pretty much just thought of as his girlfriend ive got no desire to be famous myself
4280433 i didnt know there was this whole world of literature that was much more conversational and funny and modern it was also very spiky which fitted well with my sensibilities
4280434 obviously hes a complete shit at the beginning but i wanted to break him down and see if i could redeem him
4280435 a lot of people are deluded everyone is in some way or another and its quite fascinating to try to get underneath it and find out what people are like without that grandiose kind of thing
4280436 what im doing is what im good at i dont know that i could write the great british novel hopefully its grown up chick lit or chick lit with an edge but it would bother me if people put it with all the pink fluffy i must get married stuff because i hope that it stands out from that
4280437 because im 47 and i would ask a 47 year old woman that question
4280438 i was never like little girls who love baby dolls and talk about their weddings ive never had that thing to have a child and i really really believe that if youre going to have a child you should really want one bizarrely ive been called selfish for not having children surely its more selfish to have a child when you dont really want a child
4280439 because i would lose im very uncompetitive about work because i cant stand losing
4280440 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4280441 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4280442 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4280443 i dont remotely claim its a discovery of mine but i was genuinely shocked when i first saw it because i had never seen it in any academic biography of kafka the experts conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious
4280444 outrageous and extraordinary the holocaust happened after his death so its ridiculous to talk of his works in that light
4280445 we are devastated and furious but at the same time happy
4280446 finally the literary stylite has fallen from his pedestal and is as much a sinner as you or i
4280447 when gregor samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin
4280448 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4280449 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4280450 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4280451 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4280452 i was a starter in new york i started in arizona and i played pretty well
4280453 theres no pressure ill just go out there and do what i do and thats play nose guard
4280454 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4280455 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4280456 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4280457 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedexcup
4280458 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4280459 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4280460 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4280461 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game
4280462 two detainees suffered minor abrasions as a result of the alleged assaults eight others were confined overnight in a detainee housing unit which was sprayed with riot control agent and then the ventilation secured
4280463 the day that this all took place there had actually been some unrest at the camp there had been some detainee on guard issues which ranged from spitting to throwing bodily functions at some guards
4280464 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six to take control of our own learning
4280465 students are being more canny about the subjects they do because they know that certain universities are now demanding more traditional combinations of subjects
4280466 in some ways thats unfortunate if they are being pressured to do subjects they might not be as interested in
4280467 the rise in numbers studying english shows that as ever its still the most popular subject in the curriculum its still a vibrant lively relevant subject despite being rooted in tradition
4280468 the drop might suggest that the examination system is still reasonably robust it should go some way to stemming criticisms that english is getting easier year on year it isnt the case
4280469 we are delighted that the trend is continuing students are increasingly aware that a levels in physics are seen by business and academia as the rolls royce of a levels and well worth all the effort when lining up for university places and the very best jobs but more still needs to be done to entice girls into the physics classroom
4280470 i had to go down there for an interview and im glad i had the chance
4280471 on a course like mine you really need the chance to sell yourself and to prove your enthusiasm for the subject it was a very worthwhile process to be able to go to the university and do just that you can get the grades but thats just a piece of paper
4280472 shes an immensely talented and gifted young lady hard working everything a student should be a pleasure to teach
4280473 we cant take it for granted even in katarinas case but shes shown all the character and determination which i think theyll be looking for and shell get the chance to show that when she goes down there for interview
4280474 it reflects the socio economic problems and low aspirations in places like the north east its part of a wider social story there are many more independent and selective schools in the southern half of the country than in the north
4280475 for many independent schools their reason for being is to get their results up but its just the result of creaming off the best by definition if you cream off the best you will get different results
4280476 there were 75 000 more entries in the maintained sector getting as at a level
4280477 this makes it more important for universities to take into account contextual information about a student when they apply
4280478 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap in achievement between different areas of the country the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind in school
4280479 there is now a clear divide at the heart of our education system ministers must work to find the reasons for this inequality and ensure that any improvements in our schools and colleges benefit all students
4280480 we are doing well but we need to do better at ensuring that every school in every part of the country benefits from those improvements
4280481 i think we should celebrate standards improving just as we would celebrate any olympic medal
4280482 this year has been more competitive we have fewer places available than we did last year
4280483 in the past for certain subjects we have been able to accept a limited number of near miss applicants
4280484 for selector universities not to use the new a grade would be perverse if they discount the a on the grounds that some pupils might be better prepared and will do better than others they might as well abandon the whole public examination system
4280485 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle
4280486 cute is what we aim for death cab for cutie flo rida matchbox twenty panic at the disco and t i among others
4280487 xbox 360 has been an important partner in our efforts to offer consumers more ways to experience our artists music and this is especially true among gamers who are some of the most passionate music fans with this agreement we can take advantage of microsofts music platform and provide gamers what they want music videos from their favorite artists that can be downloaded quickly and easily
4280488 weve expanded on the strength of our gaming platform with new entertainment experiences
4280489 were excited to offer wmg music videos to our 12 million members around the world as we continue to evolve our music presence
4280490 if theres one public official who has consistently put his country ahead of his party working across party lines to get things done in washington it is john mccain

4280494 its more like a huge bowl of dilute plastic soup
4280495 it feels great im thrilled for helena she was so worried she might not get the grades to get into university
4280496 annika would test me the night before exams and i would test her
4280497 the gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes
4280498 we are going straight to the place and were going to be happy
4280499 i dont know if im the average voter but i had to read two three hours to figure out what that meant
4280500 begitulah salah satu orang besar di dunia ini mengatakan bagaimana pentingnya untuk menulis
4280501 gay without levity well read without pedantry and good looking without vanity
4280502 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4280503 tuesdays audience repped a 16 increase over athens in 2004 29 4 million and is the best for a non u s summer olympics since barcelona in 1992 through five nights the beijing games are averaging 31 3 million up a hefty 21 from athens 25 8 million
4280504 gives him a couple of days to fly around with whoever it is and into the democratic convention
4280505 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4280506 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4280507 the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4280508 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4280509 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4280510 the clash and futura 2000 give a voice to new yorks graffiti artists on this early 80s 12
4280511 the escapades of futura 2000 paints a picture of life as a graffiti artist
4280512 the escapades of futura 2000 has very clever rhymes that give voice to the troubles a graffiti artist experiences in his attempt to express himself
4280513 the escapades of futura 2000 sounds surprisingly similar to the music that mick jones would later create after the dissolution of the clash
4280514 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4280515 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4280516 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4280517 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4280518 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4280519 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4280520 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4280521 crude oils pulling back has taken the pressure out of the inflation picture this translates to a natural rebound in equities
4280522 the market is really looking through the inflation data this morning which was quite scary on a headline basis and taking a more forward looking view that the inflation pressures are likely to be easing
4280523 its outrageous for a district attorney to investigate criminal libel for criticism made against him if he believes he has been libeled he should sue civilly
4280524 in the large cap space we believe that xstrata is oversold relative to anglo american perhaps attributable to its hostile bid for lonmin in the mid cap space international ferro metals and aquarius platinum have seen the largest negative share price moves
4280525 we continue to remain concerned on two issues firstly capital particularly organic capital generation and secondly the level of writedowns taken
4280526 we forecast 1 5bn of further writedowns over the next 18 months as we believe exposures could move closer to other marks in the market
4280527 autonomy should join the top companies club from september 10

4280531 there can be no certainty that any formal offer will be made
4280532 moves exploration of the north falklands basin forward significantly firming up four wells out of a six well programme
4280533 under such a scenario we see a more positive outlook for companies in the debt advisory insolvency space
4280534 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4280535 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4280536 they are sore i think i will be all right
4280537 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4280538 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel
4280539 im not worried about being in shape or catching the football thats just what i do its more about me being healthy
4280540 if i am not it will be pretty close ill be a lot further along than last year
4280541 the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and the more i take care of myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not ill be 95 or 96 which i will definitely take
4280542 like i said those things will take care of themselves
4280543 my thing right now is to get healthy if it was the case with the contract i would not be out there its all about me getting healthy and getting back to 100 percent you know jerry said what he said i think it will happen

4280547 ive been dreaming of this since i was about 8
4280548 this week the boys will make memories that will last a lifetime as a parent i feel an overwhelming sense of joy that my sons dream of playing in the series is coming true
4280549 im excited because he is my brother and he is a good player

4280551 if you went over the allotment it cost more money
4280552 we bought the model home so it had a zillion plants
4280553 i had a feeling it would come back again and haunt us
4280554 i had to draw up plans so contractors would know what to do
4280555 i visualized it i thought long and hard about how to reduce water usage
4280556 l a s future depends on our citizens to adopt an ethic of conservation
4280557 theres plenty of water here now because the snow melt was good this spring but theres no reason to believe that would happen again in any particular year
4280558 in the larger reservoirs not too far away you might see drought local rainfall variations within a region can be very wide and its difficult to predict any pattern
4280559 while 61 of americans say the effects of global warming have already begun
4280560 the loss in value due to foreign exchange for the cyclone nargis international humanitarian aid during the last three months has been about us1 56 million a1 79 million
4280561 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
4280562 factoring in pressures of power space large capital expenditures global performance and availability issues companies are faced with an exploding challenges and costs to go with the exploding storage demand
4280563 companies must take a new approach to storage they need to move from the old and out dated storage 1 0 model of do everything yourself to a new storage 2 0 cloud model
4280564 we dont want to tip our hat to the people involved
4280565 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
4280566 lifestyles filled with high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4280567 the graduate cover has been used so many times that its a joke however it was originally shot very quickly i might add for a rather crappy video cover
4280568 it is interesting to see how much out dated design affects judgement of pictures which although admittedly
4280569 por ahora no pongas mi nombre porque no queremos aparecer haciendo un reclamo individual pero esto est por explotar creemos que de la plata de los brasile os hay 600 mil pesos que no llegaron a los productores que entregaron el tabaco al presidente mentlik no lo podemos encontrar y no contesta el celular como para que aclare todo
4280570 la gente est muy caliente porque para colmo con el ingreso por la venta del tabaco de tucum n se le ten a que devolver plata al gobierno y tampoco se cumpli seg n sabemos son como 500 mil pesos y tambi n se habla de liquidaciones sospechosas a algunos socios a los que se les pag mucho m s de lo que correspond a pero no podemos aclarar nada hasta que no aparezca mentlik no se como va a terminar esta historia
4280571 pudieron pagar un precio promedio de 6 50 pesos por kilo cuando el valor oficial es de 5 50
4280572 por suerte todo se est desarrollando bien y recibimos muy buen tabaco por lo que estamos plenamente satisfechos con la campa a

4280580 of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4280581 the topaz solar farm will grow clean electricity on previously disturbed unused farmland with low profile panels minimizing visual impact
4280582 its designed to be compatible with key wildlife species and avoid
4280583 we are now here with technology available now that will allow solar to take its place among central station power plants with wind geothermal gas and coal
4280584 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4280585 thats really good news because the department of energy predicts we will need 386 gigawatts by 2015 just to keep up with load growth this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future
4280586 we talked about features like adaptive streaming the ability to automatically keep checking how much bandwidth you have and deliver the appropriate quality stream and how to be smart about knowing whats coming up in the stream

4280603 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge

4280607 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4280608 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4280609 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4280610 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4280611 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4280612 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

4280627 because he had what appeared to be a genuine logo i thought nothing more of it and did the work and phoned when they were ready
4280628 however he has never called to collect and pay for the order
4280629 and i have tried to phone him several times in the past six months but have not been able to get any reply
4280630 i guess the order might not get collected now unless the police want them
4280631 it cost 30 to have the logo made up and the total bill is 120
4280632 he spoke to one of my employees whose son is interested in animals and left his business card with her and told her he might be able to get her son a start at western plains zoo
4280633 the need for services for people with disabilities is increasing this is a community minded project and the facility is for the community
4280634 for this project to succeed we need community support we are trying to engage with local businesses with work experience programs so that we can tap into the local industries to provide worthwhile and meaningful work for clients
4280635 we will apply to the department of ageing disability and home care dadhc for a grant as well as seeking financial support from a wide range of people and industries in the local community and hope to have it fully completed in three to four years

4280646 team is our first consideration we scrutinize the people involved for their credibility commitment enthu and other parameters
4280647 if we dont see a practical exit from the investment we may have to turn you down
4280648 we dont control the startups we invest in interfering in day to day business is not our task but we do keep monitoring
4280649 therere cases where we rejected initially but entrepreneurs came to us after few months with improved plans and weve accepted
4280650 our ideal expectation is about 10x return over a span of 5 7 years
4280651 most of the decisions are taken on a case to case basis hence it is difficult to outline generic guidelines
4280652 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4280653 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4280669 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4280670 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4280671 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4280672 that has a huge impact on our town residents last year that rig answered almost 700 calls there will be mutual aid ambulances available however there could be wait times of 15 to 20 to 30 minutes if not more
4280673 the issue with the contract is a big increase going from like 67 000 a year to 165 000 a year which is a huge expense for the taxpayers in this township
4280674 i was unsure if we were going to move on i now feel that both sides want to move forward for the better service to the residents
4280675 we want noca to survive but we need to understand where the money is being spent and how its being spent

4280682 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4280683 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4280684 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4280685 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4280686 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4280687 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4280688 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4280689 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4280690 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
4280691 en las que siempre he sido sobrese do por la justicia
4280692 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4280693 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades

4280700 i very much appreciate your depth of knowledge in the mortgage industry i originally heard you on your radio show being a natural skeptic i listened several times to your show and i read your book i then researched the yield spread premium amounts on my previous property acquisitions and refinances a total of eleven of them and since i didnt go through a bank thank goodness every single one of them showed an ysp amount

4280714 property foreclosure filings for july rose 8 from june and 55 from a year earlier as credit woes and tumbling home values continue to hit homeowners foreclosure listing service realtytrac said there were foreclosure filings on 272 171 properties last month or one for every 464 households bank repossessions or reos
4280715 we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
4280716 my favourite indicator is instead house values to disposable income which i used in the mises
4280717 in order to get back within the historical range house prices will have to fall at least 19 relative disposable income and were house prices to fall to the lower end of the historical range then they would fall some 27 relative to disposable income compare this with the mere 9 relative decline from the peak we have seen so far or saw until q1 2008 using the likely q2 2008 numbers more of the needed decline will have been done away with even excluding the temporary boost to disposable income from the tax rebates but even so it is clear that house prices will have to fall a lot more in relative terms to get reasonable and that most of the decline is ahead of us
4280718 we conclude that declines in house prices are highly likely to remain small our analysis reveals unsurprisingly that foreclosures and home prices have negative effects on each other over time but this does not imply a vicious cycle of collapsing prices our models predict that as foreclosures continue to climb in many states house prices will remain flat or decline in those states but will not collapse one reason for this is that the effect of foreclosure shocks on house prices is small furthermore other fundamental factors such as employment growth and a slowing of the growth of the housing supply over the past year and a half will cushion the impact of foreclosures we constructed several forecasting models even under an extreme worst case scenario for foreclosures our conclusion was that u s house prices just arent going to fall by very much in the next two years in our worst case scenario the average cumulative decline is about 5 and only 12 states experience declines greater than 6 by the end of 2009
4280719 briefing com the stock market rallied on tuesday lifted by a drop in oil prices several better than expected quarterly earnings reports an increase in consumer confidence and speculation that the latest capital raise from a major financial firm is a sign that the worst is over for wall street
4280720 if the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome bank shareholders are certifiably mad time and again since the start of the credit crunch shares in one bank or another have rallied after the announcement of another slug of write downs on mortgage related assets and other nasties with each round of bad news investors dare to hope that a bottom has been reached and that the bank in question can start to think about a return to health invariably their hopes have been dashed
4280721 barrons unfortunately for the rest of us you have a pretty good forecasting track record how much more misery lies ahead
4280722 roubini we are in the second inning of a severe protracted recession which started in the first quarter of this year and is going to last at least 18 months through the middle of next year a systemic banking crisis will go on for awhile with hundreds of banks going belly up
4280723 i think 2 trillion is too high but the number will definitely be huge
4280724 washington marketwatch as the economy continues to suffer from the housing downturn and fallout from risky mortgages the federal reserve board on monday voted unanimously to bar lenders from making higher priced mortgages without regard to a consumers ability to repay regarding higher priced loans the feds new rules also prohibit lenders from relying on income or assets that it does not verify to determine repayment ability imposing prepayment penalties if the payment can change during the initial four years and making a loan without establishing an escrow account for property taxes and homeowners insurance for first lien loans
4280725 i swear to god mildred i saw it drive right up out of the water its one of those new models you know
4280726 government interventions directly in housing or mortgage markets are not necessarily the best policy responses
4280727 by allowing markets to sort themselves out quickly a foundation for sustainable homeownership and responsible mortgage lending can be re established
4280728 from an economic standpoint this decline of overvalued properties is necessary
4280729 if house prices are allowed to remain artificially high homebuilders will make the eventual correction even worse by supplying more unneeded houses and driving prices down even further
4280730 in order to ensure the mortgage market functions effectively the lender must have the ability to seize the borrowers property as collateral
4280731 without the possibility of foreclosure mortgage rates would be more on par with those of credit cards
4280732 it is important to keep in mind that there will be those individuals who are truly harmed by the crisis
4280733 the financial distress to borrowers and communities caused by foreclosure should be addressed directly
4280734 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount

4280738 we got to what i think is the just result which is this man should not have to continue to pay more money just to get out of prison when all the signs are pointing toward he shouldnt have been in there in the first place in this particular go around in this case its a just result in that sense
4280739 im trying to find the quickest way to get him out of prison obviously
4280740 if they do i think harrison could be out monday they could drive up there to chillicothe show the proper paperwork get him in the sheriffs vehicle get him back to madison county he signs the bond and hes out now how long it will take to do that i dont know
4280741 we used to be a dominant side in asia but today japan hold the advantage
4280742 japan have made fantastic progress and are among the technically strongest teams not only in asia but also the world now as one can see from their 5 1 thrashing of norway in their last game
4280743 the japanese have many talented individuals and they are very organised their passing is very fluid and they hold onto possession well thus we cant let the game go the way they want to spoil their game plan we have to reduce their space and break up their passing with interceptions and tackles and we should make the most of our physical edge to make up for our technical shortcomings
4280744 no one wants to admit it but we are in a recession
4280745 its a crisis not only in the private sector in the public sector
4280746 im just being forthright about what kind of situation were in in preparing communities preparing people overall that this is a bad time and we have to take measure that are not going to be easy
4280747 if its a massive layoff if they lay off over 1 000 people the folks that are going to get hurt the worst are going to be the citizens of the city of chicago
4280748 because somewhere along the line services are going to need to be cut
4280749 if you come across or know of any other catholic translations which have been released into the public domain or have liberal enough usage policies let me know and i could try to include them in a future version of the cre some protestant translations are also a definite possibility if anyone were interested

4280819 i expect anything in my line of business im always prepared and never surprised
4280820 but what did he do in the end he dumped us and joined umno
4280821 we pas have bigger challenges ahead but our struggles and principles are being compromised by the other two parties pkr and dap
4280822 does that mean we have to be sensitive to their needs and keep quiet just because we are in a marriage
4280823 we are giving a warning now pas will not be bullied in our quest to champion the islamic struggle
4280824 they even have the gall to tell him not to talk about it
4280825 we have our own president who is more qualified and yet they want anwar is it because they are so taken up by his claim of forming the government on sept 16
4280826 what is our partys obsession with anwar anyway even in our own party organ harakah there is more news about anwar than about our own leaders
4280827 the behind the scene approach had caused confusion among our supporters
4280828 we are not just facing umno but the whole bn machinery this permatang pauh is our stronghold but we must not be complacent with the situation
4280829 dont look down on the bn machinery we dont want anyone among us to feel very comfortable we must be prepared as the contest is not an easy one whats important is we must defend permatang pauh
4280830 we definitely have a tough fight on our hands arif shah is a qualified candidate and we respect his strengths especially his rapport at the grassroots level
4280831 the fact that he has beaten other bn front runners like datuk dr pirdaus ismail and ezam mohd nor to be the man for permatang pauh has got our attention

4280838 a disturbing thing with younger nurses is that because of the workload and just other nurses being too busy to do actual mentoring we are seeing high rates of nurses just saying after a couple of years i cant deal with this so they leave the profession altogether
4280839 its a real concern because when youre looking at an aging workforce you want to have nurses that are going to be in the system to replace the nurses that are retiring
4280840 and if theyre not there to replace them then whos going to get nursing care
4280841 were definitely aware the nursing environment these days is not ideal because its such an acute complex working arena so it does make for definite challenges
4280842 i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
4280843 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it

4280846 simple and quick dishes like fried rice or noodles are my favourite as i can prepare them in a short time
4280847 i started to notice the monotony of our meals as the children would just gulp down a bowl of their favourite breakfast cereal and refuse to eat anything else
4280848 its funny how we took our meals for granted before our eating and spending habits were published in the new straits times
4280849 where are the others we are giving them the chance to be economically independent and they should take the opportunity
4280850 its normal the muktamar is a platform for us to speak our minds

4280857 my husband gave me the cold shoulder for 10 days because he thought that i must have done something for them to raid the house if not for our children we might have gone our separate ways
4280858 the neighbours were also asking my mother about the incident until she was forced to remain indoors for two days due to the embarrassment

4280861 digital imaging for mammography at least when were looking at quality is at least as good
4280862 in some cases when we look at patients younger patients with very glandular or very dense breasts and peri menopausal or pre menopausal women that study did conclude digital mammography was the best choice
4280863 we are trying to minimize that impact by continuing to bring in locum support as we have for the last year for mammography
4280864 once we move to digital mammography then we can look at how we can transmit those images off island for further support there as well

4280874 we should mellow problematic students by telling them how they should act for the betterment of their life
4280875 the three of them should set aside their differences and work hand in hand to ensure that we give anwar a good fight
4280876 there is no point in merely saying that we will work together when this is not truly reflected in actions
4280877 abdul jalil and pirdaus must now convince their supporters to set aside personal differences and work together as a team
4280878 how far this can be achieved will be seen in the next few days
4280879 this will be crucial in determining whether bn can actually take the fight to pkr
4280880 anwar should ask his friends in pakatan rakyat like datuk seri abdul hadi awang that question as there are many in that coalition who serve both as mp and state assemblyman
4280881 for us in bn what is important is that arif shah is well received by the people
4280882 at the end of the day it is the voters in permatang pauh who will decide

4280884 the opposition wants to see us losing our deposit in this by election

4280887 im for strengthening the dollar but i also think weve got to have the economic policies in place for a stronger economy that will over time make sure that the dollar will be stronger

4280892 permits or licences to sell alcohol should either be limited or only allowed for areas inhabited by non muslims and such premises should not be allowed to operate in predominantly muslim areas
4280893 the permits to sell alcohol also should only be given to non muslims as malays are forbidden from consuming alcohol in the first place

4280899 rarely is the dewan ulama given room to state its views on matters related to islam in the media including internal media
4280900 we do not want to see only those who are over 40 or 58 joining the dewan ulama
4280901 personally i have nothing against anwar and will not touch on personal issues during the election campaign as he is an old friend of mine i have my party and its policies as he has his own
4280902 anwar who is living in kuala lumpur is popular in the national and international arenas so why does he not choose a seat in the federal territory to contest to get into parliament i hope he will leave permatang pauh for the sake of an old friend
4280903 i have helped to resolve many of the problems of the local malay chinese and indian communities i view myself as their servant and am indebted to them for giving me the opportunity to serve them as an elected representative

4280986 pity we cant open them up to see how theyre doing
4280987 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
4280988 what i want to emphasize is that im coming home to play
4280989 im coming home to help the sounders win to help the sounders establish themselves as one of the top franchises in the country if not really the benchmark for what soccer is going to become in this country

4280995 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4280996 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4280997 the situation we face is a situation of stagnation and steep slowdown
4280998 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months
4280999 but overall theres no reason for excessive pessimism based on the development of the first half of the year
4281000 there is a good chance the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4281001 net trade is still likely to make a small positive contribution to gdp growth this year and next
4281002 but this will be due to a weakening in import growth as the domestic economy weakens rather than a major strengthening in export growth and it will not be enough to prevent the uk from entering a recession and from activity slowing by even more than the bank of england expects
4281003 todays reports paint a similar picture sharp corrections in fixed investment and exports those having been the main engine of growth over the past few years and stagnating private consumption

4281012 throw the bums out referring to the incumbent homeowners association board of directors which happens to be the response mr robert mcdaniel a laguna woods resident got when he spoke to lou penrose listening in for congressman john campbell
4281013 just as you were unable to keep the house in session when you wished to address energy issues we who live in laguna woods village wish to have our concerns heard in open meetings and have our governing agent and boards be responsive to our needs
4281014 reads in part a letter sent to congressman campbell by mr mcdaniel
4281015 my statements are quite true if you can prove other wise i will then and only then take back my words and apologize
4281016 i have repeatedly invited mr thurman to be a guest on the program to share his insights about scca and the value of a 55 only community he has conveniently ignored me therefore i am writing to all of you to ask if mr thurman for whatever reason does not want to be a guest on the program perhaps one among you would enjoy the opportunity to represent scca on menifee valley talk radio
4281017 when she heard that i had this audition for that she told me you know what

4281020 im kind of used to it because every film ive done before im always making love to a beautiful woman or running around naked
4281021 its really deeper than we know and deeper than we get to know

4281024 definition love is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometers away using an aratech sniper rifle with a tri light scope statement this definition i am told is subject to interpretation obviously love is a matter of odds not many meatbags could make such a shot and fewer would derive love from it yet for me love is knowing your target putting them in your targeting reticle and together achieving a singular purpose against statistically long odds

4281035 as i sit here today it is impossible to say what happened to the cases of the 18 000 murders that happened five years ago

4281088 last year we over achieved for as many young players as we had and considering that our top offensive threat went out after two games
4281089 with as many players as we return we anticipate that we should have a good football team but we have some question marks
4281090 the top capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 would return to 20 the lowest rate that existed in the 1990s and the rate president bush proposed in his 2001 tax cut a 20 rate is almost a third lower than the rate president reagan set in 1986
4281091 and my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that
4281092 i think that we can have a capital gains rate that is higher than 15 percent the current level if it and if it you know when i talk to people like warren buffet or others and i ask them you know whats how much of a difference is it going to be if its 20 or 25 percent they say look if its within that range then its not going to distort i think economic decision making
4281093 this misguided policy will drive capital off shore and turn a flow into a torrent
4281094 the financial problems of american banks will be amplified mccain should pounce on this issue and correlate the current crisis with obamas position on capital gains it would be a big winner
4281095 what exactly is the middle ground when it comes to freedom of the press in february 2006 kevin libin was the western standards editor and i was its publisher so either we decided what went in the magazine or these radical muslims decided what went in the magazine how do you split the difference on that either the magazine was ours or it was theirs courtesy of a thieving state im not quite sure how to compromise

4281107 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit
4281108 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4281109 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4281110 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4281111 we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4281112 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4281131 roland mouret is fascinated by nuance the exact spot at which a seam hits the waist the impact of angles created by a single fabric fold how the subtle shift of a dart makes all the difference in the way a dress caresses the body
4281132 mouret worked with the same basic principles as last season lean shapes precision cuts slyly intricate seaming origami folds but now delivered them with a slightly more aggressive attitude punctuated by a tougher shoe
4281133 you cant laugh in a dress like this it hurts
4281134 mouse skin is different from human skin but the research could help to explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer
4281135 extrapolation between the species for this aspect of biology is simply not warranted many agents that cause skin cancer in mice do not do so in man indeed some of these agents are used as therapies it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the results have any clinical relevance
4281136 if the theory that applying moisturisers increased the risk of non melanoma skin cancers were correct you would expect to see more of these cancers in women and on their faces
4281137 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so
4281138 theres no way you should be able to eat what michael phelps eats this is not even a normal athlete i would not recommend this kind of diet for even a fit and serious competitor in say a 10km road race this man is in a very very different place to the rest of us hes 6ft 4in and 192lb of pure joy from a female perspective obviously though i probably shouldnt say that

4281141 say hes doing about four miles a session and a couple of sessions a day
4281142 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4281143 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4281144 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4281145 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4281146 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4281147 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4281148 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4281149 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fibre maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4281150 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4281151 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4281152 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4281153 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case
4281154 the average person is going to burn about 400 calories

4281163 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4281164 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4281165 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4281166 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4281167 as a result of recent events in georgia we have formally taken a decision not to do that not to participate in an operation that was known as vigilant eagle which would have involved canadian american and russian forces
4281168 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4281169 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4281170 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4281171 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4281172 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4281173 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4281174 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4281175 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4281176 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4281178 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4281179 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4281180 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4281181 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4281182 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4281183 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4281185 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4281186 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4281187 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4281188 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4281189 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4281190 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4281191 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4281192 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4281193 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4281194 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4281195 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4281197 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4281198 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4281199 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4281200 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4281201 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4281202 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4281203 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4281204 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4281205 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4281206 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4281207 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4281208 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4281209 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4281210 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4281211 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4281212 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4281213 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

4281216 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4281217 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4281218 my whole thing is for me to get healthy i dont think me going out and playing in one or two preseason games is going to be that much of a factor or prevent me from doing anything or performing on opening night for me its all about being healthy im not worrying about me being in shape or running and catching the football i mean thats just what i do its just about me getting healthy
4281219 my feet are really sore because of the orthotics but its the first time ive actually ran and played in just a little bit
4281220 its just going to take some time for me to get used to it and time to break them in so to speak but once i get past that stage i think that everything will be downhill from there
4281221 both of my feet are hurting a little bit im going to have to get used to it and basically get my feet into shape so they can tolerate it if its too much then well probably do something else but well see how it goes
4281222 im going to go out and run around run a few more routes and you know just go and see how sore i am the next day thats one of the major reasons why im doing it im getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick so im just trying to get a sense for how i feel and where im at
4281223 i can get out there and run around and do some things that i want to do so like i said its just basically soreness its not what i had last year so im excited about turning the corner and getting healthy the healthier i am the more explosive ill be
4281224 im getting treatment two or three times a day im icing and stimming and everything that i can possibly do to knock some of the swelling and soreness out and things like that were making progress and turning the corner its exciting for me especially for me to get out there and run around a little bit
4281225 my feet are not in the same position theyve been in for the first 30 years of my life
4281226 so its kind of putting them in a new position and theyre not comfortable with it and theyre getting sore but i think ill be alright its just about getting used to them
4281227 when i get healthy dont just try and go away from it
4281228 stay on top of it and make sure it doesnt have any flares or anything like that with me going out and playing i know there will be times where i jam it a few times or get tackled or whatever i know its going to happen im just trying to prevent those things from happening by getting it as strong as it possibly can get and me just getting back to being myself
4281229 ill be a lot further along than i was last year the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not 100 ill probably be 95 or 96 which ill definitely take
4281230 we work on his mechanics every once in a while because his weight distribution has to be talked about
4281231 but generally he has thrown the ball extremely well i think he is throwing the ball better this spring in this preseason better than he did a year ago i think he is in a rhythm hes got good balance and i think hes been doing a nice job
4281232 first of all you take anthony wright who has been very good as he has continued to develop in his second year in the offense
4281233 both guys played well last week the thing was that anthony got in with the second line and some of the first guys and we were able to protect him well a year ago we didnt protect anthony and he got beat up pretty good then we got carr in and put up very similar statistics to anthony as long as they both continue play well there will be a heck of a battle for that number two spot
4281234 there are times where he rushes through it we have go to get him to slow down stay in rhythm stay within the reads and not to force it if we can do a talented young man hes very athletic he runs very well he has a strong arm but hes just got to settle down in the pocket
4281235 no hes like a lot of young guys they lose their confidence
4281236 how fast can you come back from that i think hes starting to have a little success i think hes starting to understand what tom wants from the quarterback position if we can keep him in rhythm keep him balanced and not be in a hurry to rush from the pocket i think he will be fine
4281237 its a little bit lower than it was when it was before we talk about that all the time
4281238 he has a very quick release hes got a strong arm hes getting to a point in his life where he is going to start hurting his elbow hurting his shoulder if he doesnt become more mechanically sound he still has done pretty good work as far as turning the ball over
4281239 he has such a strong arm he has so much torque in his body when he gets it out of there but at some point that torque is going to start to tighten up on him and he is going to have trouble throwing the ball
4281240 we had an extended amount of time here where we tried to improve his situation
4281241 it didnt seem like we were getting very far it was very unfortunate because we thought when we first brought shane in this would be something where both parties would benefit we had a veteran football player a guy who had gone through some things and was anxious to really start his career over we thought that this was the right situation we worked him out he was in outstanding shape and we didnt think there was going to be any down side whatsoever the unfortunate thing is that on his best practice day that very evening he couldnt come back out and practice we wished him well and hopefully he will get himself back to where he feels good about having an opportunity
4281242 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4281243 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4281244 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4281245 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4281246 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4281247 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4281248 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4281260 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack

4281262 a mostly british expression urging someone to stick to the thing he knows best horses for courses comes from the horse racing world where it is widely assumed that some horses race better on certain courses than on others

4281269 to address the kind of things we need to hear to be more sensitive to the issues
4281270 you never really knew what was going to happen from one day to the next
4281271 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4281272 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4281273 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4281274 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4281275 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart

4281281 vladimir putins invoking bushs iraq adventure points directly to the way in which bush has enabled other world powers to act impulsively
4281282 we cannot allow georgia to become the first victim of a new world order as imagined by moscow

4281324 we learned that its all about safety and reliability and trees and power lines have never been compatible
4281325 we do annual inspections of our transmission lines and vegetation management every five years thats all been done in the past and now we just have a stricter standard that we apply
4281326 in the past we may have trimmed some trees as opposed to removing them but now the standard is that we clear the entire width of the right of way and we remove anything growing over 15 feet

4281336 my grandfather housed the musical instruments of his village and myfather was a musician
4281337 but i was theeldest son and i wasnt supposed to play music so i left the village and settled in kinshasa its the same for many musicians you go to the capital to play
4281338 i had a brother who died when he was very young and to prevent the same thing happening to me i was surrounded by music night and day my mother had to sing to me all the time she soaked me in it
4281339 the chiefs dance impersonates all the forces of the universe all the animals lions eagles as many animals as possible that represent power
4281340 thats when your son dies thats when your mother gets sick if you provoke somebody or insult somebody theyll wait for the seventh moon to settle the score
4281341 theres no such thing as a kasai neighbourhood in kinshasa
4281342 but many groups perform in the same area because thats where you can play music live and go out on a saturday night
4281343 i had been following urban kasai music in kinshasa for years but i couldnt afford to bring the different groups i knew to europe so i asked them if it would it be possible to take three of one group three of another and try to make a common repertoire
4281344 all these people played for their own community in their own neighbourhood and werent used to working together
4281345 but i noticed that one of the xylophone players was a master who knew all the tricks he would keep filing the keys to make a perfect tuning i proposed to him as a challenge that he play with another tuning the idea more or less got together after that and while i was away they decided to try it
4281346 afterwards i thought well thats it its not going to last when youre under the very harsh economic constraints you get in kinshasa i thought they would go back to their own groups but somehow the idea had become so appealing to them that they decided to keep on doing it without any support
4281347 kasai is about the same size as france right in the centre of the congo it was the first time in many years that people from kasai saw a traditional kasai group performing on stage it generated a lot of enthusiasm so that was a good reason to keep trying to do it
4281348 it was done completely live either outside the local bar they used or in the back garden of a friend
4281349 you cant record this kind of music in a studio
4281350 those who play it are ostracised nowadays traditions are kept more alive in the cities than in the villages they cant see what youre doing there
4281351 when i last went back in 2006 there were no musicians at all my brother had to go and buy a cassette player and the cassette they played was my cassette from kinshasa
4281352 nowadays its easier to find thumb pianos slit drums and marimbas in the northern hemisphere than it is in the cities or villages of the congo

4281357 you want to give them freedom and independence and yet you have to keep a careful eye on them at all times
4281358 the disregard for the house rules and staying away and not telling me where hes at and lying about things
4281359 if you feel in your gut or in your heart that theres something going on you need to act on that you cant shrug it off

4281361 zacchaeus come down immediately i must stay at your house today
4281362 he has gone to be the guest of a sinner
4281363 look lord here and now i give half of my possessions to the poor and if i have cheated anybody out of anything i will pay back four times the amount
4281364 im getting rid of half of my stuff im gonna give to the poor and if i cheated anyone im gonna pay them back four times what i took
4281365 man i want my heart and my life right i want the garbage to be out of me i want to be clean
4281366 is my heart like zacchaeus am i ready to drop everything come running to jesus and do whatever it takes to make things right
4281367 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
4281368 sadism is all right in its place but it should be directed to proper ends i have found little that is good about human beings on the whole in my experience most of them are trash

4281371 my body has been telling me for a while that i should stop playing
4281372 it wasnt even a tough decision because i can barely train anymore so enough is enough
4281373 every time i have been on the verge of reaching a landmark game i suffered an injury
4281374 two games before my 100th i injured my knee and then one game before my 150th i did my knee again so i wasnt even thinking about the 200th until i got through last week
4281375 i came close but i thought i would probably get more of a run at easts and i had always been taken care of
4281376 i am glad i stayed at the one club people dont realise the benefits of staying with one club
4281377 i think a lot of the guys who go from one club to another will look back and regret it later on
4281378 even though we lost that match it was an amazing game to be a part of and people who dont even follow the wizard cup come up and ask me about that match even now
4281379 that was a complete shock to me i went to the dinner thinking surely i wont be in it but then my name was read out and i was left speechless i didnt know what to say

4281383 this appears to be the first example of cryptic female choice found in an externally fertilising species
4281384 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence previously it had been thought that once their eggs had been released females had very little say over which of the males around her would fertilise them
4281385 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4281386 from the females perspective it makes sense that when you only have one opportunity to reproduce in your life you want to make sure you get it right
4281387 for the males you could say that the upshot is that there may be someone for everyone in the salmon world the race does not always go to the naturally fastest runner as the conditions on the racecourse differ
4281388 for instance whatever it is in this ovarian fluid that is enhancing or retarding sperm function may have a similar effect on sperm in other species
4281389 hey meis even weer een berichtje van je nicht wat een geweldige woorden bij dag 56 zo denk ik er precies ook over en heb het precies zo ervaren een paar jaren terug je bent wie je bent en ik denk juist dat nu je deze ervaring hebt ook weet aan wie je wat hebt wat je zelf ook aan gaf blijf juist jezelf meid want ik ken ook mensen die zijn veranderd sinds ze zijn afgevallen ik weet dat je dat doet en dat maakt je wie je bent want dankzij je persoonlijkheid ben je nu aan het afvallen omdat je een krachtig persoonlijkheid hebt en weet wat je wil en je maakt het ook waar blijf in jezelf geloven want neem van mij aan een ander doet dat niet altijd ik blijf aan je denken hoor ookal reageer ik niet elke dag heel veel liefs petra

4281392 this iraqi forces surge explains how we can continue to see very low levels of violence even though coalition forces have taken away a lot of combat power based
4281393 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
4281394 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
4281395 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
4281396 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
4281397 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force
4281398 ralph has cornered the market in corporate strategic communications and grassroots using his social conservative base combined with his personal communications skills and his influence in the bush reelection campaign

4281415 the increase in leveling speed allows players to create new characters and advance nearly twice as fast as before this will allow players to experience the meat of lineage ii quickly giving them the ability to visit new and exciting areas and cool high level content much quicker than before while this game is still a hardcore game these changes with gracia part 1 make the game much more accessible to new players i hope gamers will take another look at what lineage ii has to offer

4281420 e ora passo il tempo a chiedermi che fai senza me
4281421 our overall pricing is healthy but rising costs continue to put pressure on our margins
4281422 from the sellers viewpoint it was quite disappointing they definitely need more to cover increasing costs for them to carry on producing sheep in the less favoured areas
4281423 buyers also face additional burdens including the huge increase in fertiliser costs they need a more consistent price for finished lambs so they can pass that back to the breeders we are getting close to crunch time for many hill sheep farmers
4281424 the grain is coming off at high moisture levels some more than 25 per cent putting the grain through driers to bring it down to 15 per cent is incurring frightening fuel bills
4281425 i have already seen oilseed rape coming in with between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the sample sprouted that is all right as long as the oil content is not affected but we are on the edge
4281426 i wasnt quite sure what to expect i thought everyone would be wearing victorian clothes
4281427 you either call it pop music or try to find words for it
4281428 i think its pop music theyre short songs with choruses and verses
4281429 she said i really enjoyed your music ive been listening to your cd all week it was really surreal
4281430 you just have to be good at what you do i have a lot of respect for musicians who are versatile but i think its probably from school a lot of people are just showing off its not honest youre just showing off which is quite boring musically
4281431 my voice is all right but im not a refined player or singer and my dictions lazy these are all things id like to work on but im much more interested in making exciting music interesting sounds than i am in aspiring to make music thats very polished

4281460 then i ran out of the girls house after drinking the bottle and here i am got it

4281462 who am i i just told you jeez iida san was spacey but this is just ridiculous you know what who are you
4281463 you shouldnt lose your head like that dear it might be beneficial if you learn to control that temper
4281464 its easy for you to say you havent been the one growing and shrinking at the whim of the foods you eat your not the one
4281465 your not the one who doesnt even know who you are anymore
4281466 not know who you are anymore all because of your size how insecure
4281467 well not just my size but i would like to change my size maybe a bit bigger than three inches three inches is to troublesome
4281468 whats wrong with three inches thats how tall i am and i am perfectly happy with it
4281469 you know what never mind i am tired of this conversation goodbye crazy rude girl
4281470 just so you know i wouldnt try eating that mushroom your sitting on one side will make you taller and the other smaller
4281471 you know what never mind i am tired of this conversation goodbye crazy rude girl
4281472 at the last minute weve been unable to reach mutually agreeable terms with valve on bcr so they wont be carrying it
4281473 i wont get into the details but we do continue to have a good relationship with valve and future capcom titles we expect to be carried on steam
4281474 im krieg sind die k pfe der krisenherd die macht macht krieg die menschen vieles verkehrt
4281475 yes that proposal is in its advance stage and well very soon engage them in various social activities of our department
4281476 ill make snake catching popular for the economic value of its venom
4281477 any organised temporary activity including an organised gathering parade protest
4281478 mandating that somebody stay in business as a grocery store is problematic
4281479 it is not clear to me at the moment what the right solution is
4281480 expanding this to low density residential areas may not be supported by the residents it is intended to serve
4281481 prepackaged soft drinks cigarettes and snack foods either from automatic vending machines or in shelves occupying a floor area not to exceed 40 square feet
4281482 that sort of reminds me of those signs eat here get gas
4281483 to me a grocery store carries dry goods dairy produce meat and groceries
4281484 quark has been quickly dying for years and continues to do so
4281485 quark is still the preferred software by art ad houses and print bureaus
4281486 we open quark 4 x files in indd and have virtually no issues
4281487 complacency greed and zero customer relations killed quark long before indesign came around it was just that we fleas had no warm body to jump to before adobe came to the rescue even v1 of indesign with all its flaws was a welcome alternative to a quark weary industry
4281488 web sites are so good at first access content youve really got to play to the strengths of the media if you want to know about a great game first probably the webs the best place to go but our readers have always said in surveys that the main reason they buy us for is for reviews reading a review in print is still quite nice and print has such a legacy of respect which is one of the reasons we keep coming back
4281489 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4281490 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4281491 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4281492 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4281493 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4281494 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop
4281495 people have taken many risks and made many sacrifices to be here and just because ice says come here they arent going to leave everything behind
4281496 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4281497 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4281498 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4281499 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4281500 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4281501 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4281502 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4281503 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game
4281504 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4281505 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4281506 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4281507 at the end of the day anyone would kill to have a silver medal at the olympics
4281508 the coaching staff lawrie and the boys they pick players who they think are going to fit in with the mould of the club and you know the new boys who have come on this year theyve fitted straight in
4281509 weve got to know each other really well throughout the pre season and its a great dressing room at the moment
4281510 we certainly recognise the importance of having a consistent first round and what that did for us last year
4281511 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match
4281512 she just mistimed it a little bit and didnt get to where she should have but luckily enough she scraped there
4281513 very clearly are used to help people achieve quite exceptional performances
4281514 its a challenge its the most rewarding part of my career ive ever had
4281515 ive seen athletes with bicycles ive designed get on the dais ive seen paralympians get on the dais when you develop technology and the athletes using it win or do a personal best its addictive its like running the race yourself
4281516 you read the rules first you say to yourself this is what we cant do legally now lets start working out how to make this person go faster
4281517 if it became trendy tomorrow for people to wear prosthetic feet and everybody wanted one they would have to be mass produced and you would get economies of scale
4281518 we know that with this technology we can give disabled people a better quality of life theres a social benefit that flows from having this technology at the paralympics
4281519 the fact that people can now get flex feet commercially in sydney or melbourne rather than having to go to a clinic is great
4281520 its still improving its going ahead in leaps and bounds he says
4281521 in the past there was a lot of trial and error now there is such a database of knowledge built up that we can design something for all types of athletes however it gets very hard to produce technology that gives a dominant edge to a particular athlete
4281522 for people who have poor finger strength they get gloves that have small carbon fibre inserts if you need the ability to have a high drawback of a string in archery for example the gloves give added strength for the fingers
4281523 one of the big problems for athletes is they often below the waist dont have the sense of feeling which means they cant tell when they are getting very cold
4281524 i think what were going to see is that where in the past you had one athlete who had the in built advantage from the technology and with significant ability now you are going to see two or three athletes in particular events with that advantage
4281525 the fact that someone else is pounding along half a metre behind you is going to motivate you the prospect of being beaten is going to motivate you you will see this reflected on the times and the performances and it means that races and competitions will be closer than before
4281526 when they mentioned our names for all the different categories i was most proud of jamie being nominated for male vocalist i really thought he was deserving of that
4281527 hes one of the best bass players weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4281528 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4281529 you know theres a lot of young bands out there that are really entertaining the people these days id rather one of them would win it because theyre great but i still love talking to people on stage and we do requests from the audience all the time i figure they pay to get in to see you so you need to do what they want you to do
4281530 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked
4281531 they certainly decided it was important enough on their own
4281532 utter deference to the executive to decide what it wanted and to do what it wanted and to violate the law
4281533 hes long said he wants an apology an acknowledgment of what they did and why they sent him to syria and he wants to make sure it doesnt happen to anybody else
4281534 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4281535 is to wallow in it self pity does not solve the problem
4281536 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
4281537 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4281538 because a few of them you probably cant properly converse with theyre so much younger
4281539 thank you for all your hard work over the years
4281540 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4281541 weve heard the reports and we continue to monitor it
4281542 i havent heard of a military coup but i think if they are be moving forward on impeachment proceedings it seems to be within their constitution
4281543 pakistans president pervez musharraf is expected to leave office in the next few days before pakistans parliament takes up impeachment
4281544 no primeiro jogo contra o gr mio est vamos com a cabe a na libertadores depois houve jogos que deixamos escapar tamb m contra ipatinga figueirense fluminense h v rios jogos que deixamos passar mas isso faz parte do passado teremos 19 partidas decisivas para buscarmos o objetivo
4281545 um time muito forte e parecido com o nosso porque n o tem grandes estrelas mas muito bem armado e tem jogadores bons na bola a rea um time muito competitivo que fica ainda mais forte com o apoio do torcedor
4281546 quem tem boca fala o que quer e eu prefiro nem comentar mas o time dele t o bom que os jogadores n o querem ficar l
4281547 sempre achei o tita um grande atleta e tenho certeza que hoje mais sereno ele jamais repetiria o que falou
4281548 sou um f dele por sua simplicidade e postura ele pode parecer caipira para falar mas o jeito dele e eu tamb m sou assim e tem aquele estresse que faz parte dele
4281549 we will not acquiesce to unrealistic and in our view unnecessary demands
4281550 from a precedent point of view its hard to argue a case against it a proposed anti trust deal
4281551 the essence of new york is such a big part of lipstick jungle i think thats the added element making it not just another show about pretty clothes and things like that
4281552 shes such an icon theres such a level of respect for her talent and her longevity and her just her humor and the idea that she was one of the first not only just in television but just to represent women in the workforce who didnt have to negate who they were or become a man to be powerful and to be strong she kind of walks onto the set with all of that and commands a great deal of respect thats been sort of the private part of it so shes mtm you gotta get over that fact first and then she just became my mom
4281553 people dip in and dip out of them thats the problem theyre stag do material i dont think there are many blokes who would be happy to read zoo or nuts on public transport
4281554 it is possible we may be about to see one of those periodic shifts in fashion and manners in which modern man no longer wants his women quite so topless
4281555 we are very disappointed with this decision however robert dudley remains chief executive pending completion of an appeal process robert has bps full support we believe this is clearly a further example of administrative activity orchestrated by the other shareholders in tnk bp
4281556 aar shareholders and senior russian executives inside tnk bp had repeatedly raised concerns with robert dudley and bp regarding the companys failure to adhere to russian laws including labour regulations but our warnings were not taken seriously this court decision shows we were right to be worried
4281557 they the fed and the treasury should have wiped out the shareholders nationalised the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted as five or 10 individual privately held units
4281558 in the private sector greater financial discipline at individual institutions must be reinforced by a renewed commitment to collective discipline there are circumstances in which individual institutions must be prepared to put aside specific interests in the name of the common interest
4281559 in that case i have a dick and i would love to fill your vagina

4281569 if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industries
4281570 ive heard it all before the times have changed and i suggest he moves with them as well these are arguments he trotted out 10 to 12 years ago
4281571 whats different is that the industry is different and heathrow is very different
4281572 things have moved on very significantly since 2001 we now have open skies five more airlines are now flying to the us from heathrow we also have more competition between alliances than in 2001
4281573 i think things have changed after open skies and they are not setting any precedents what ba is asking for is what both the other major alliances already have
4281574 i would think they have a better chance this time round
4281575 regulators realise this industry needs consolidation even branson recognises the need for it he just doesnt want it in his own back yard
4281576 weve had to do some cute things very quickly in our coastal stores
4281577 we will postpone the development for a period but we are not putting a definitive timescale on that period what we are trying to do is get premium rents on the building by postponing the development we think we are more likely to get the rents we want
4281578 the operations of our business are going well we have increased earnings per share and our dividend and sold nearly 700m of property in the period however that is all taking place in the context of a cyclical downturn in the economy
4281579 after about 20 minutes a degree of panic had set in
4281580 the mechanic gave them a list of things to do open the drivers door and close it turn the wipers on lock the car click your heels three times etc and then try again vrrroooom youve never seen a 20ft pink car move so fast
4281581 it is permissible for a muslim to kill an apostate a convert from islam
4281582 what is shocking is the speed of the collapse in germany
4281583 i think there has been a lot of hubris at the ecb they took a derisory attitude towards the us saying the federal reserve was too aggressive in cutting rates now they are reaping the bitter reward of their policy
4281584 the confidence expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature
4281585 they boxed themselves in and it became hard to retreat it is clear from the august bulletin that they have now really woken up to the downturn
4281586 recessions in europe are very nasty events they tend to be a lot deeper and more protracted than in the us which is better able to cope with the ups and downs of the business cycle
4281587 the bursting of the emu credit bubble seems imminent and will reveal current account imbalances among euro area countries as extremely dangerous the medium term feasibility of the euro area in its current form must be open to very considerable doubt
4281588 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages
4281589 had received a preliminary approach from a further third party and as a result is providing access to information materials
4281590 it is an option working with providence and carlyle for blackstone but other avenues still remain open
4281591 the time that meredith was still a little afraid of the grocery store
4281592 meredith is so lazy she must be dragged to the grocery store
4281593 apareci una figura portentosa en el cielo una mujer vestida de sol
4281594 cristo ha resucitado primicia de todos los que han muerto
4281595 i bet you didnt know that i have struggled with my eye sight for years it started in high school when it became difficult for me to see the chalkboard in class i never wanted to wear contacts or glasses so i have just kind of dealt with it i got glasses but never wore them i am getting lasik eye surgery soon and im sooo scared
4281596 a latin aphorism that may be translated as to be and not to seem to be in other words we are what we say we are we do what we say we do
4281597 adidas has yao ming and nike has yi jianlian another basketball player li ning has china

4281696 from the western materialistic point of view wed think it was great if a rich person said i want to make charity
4281697 the best dharma practice the most perfect most substantial is without doubt the practice of bodhicitta
4281698 bodhicitta the aspiration to attain enlightenment in order to benefit all sentient beings is something that is truly inconceivable truly splendid and marvellous
4281699 if you churn the 84 000 teachings of the buddha their essence is bodhicitta

4281763 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved
4281764 they appear to be breeding earlier across a number of sites and the worry is they may eventually breed so early they are out of sync with their major food source of caterpillars

4281780 this is absolutely the best time to buy in florida two years ago when we were waiting in lines lotteries sending offers to homes that just got listed that day we were thinking the market was just great the buyers were happy the sellers were happy and we were happy well we started not feeling so happy when the market started to shift the prices started dropping the lenders started tightening and the buyers got scared because most of those buyers had something to sell and their property wasnt selling they couldnt buy the whole domino effect took place and one thing after another we all started looking for new ways new solutions what areas in florida do you advice investors to buy i personally sell in middle to higher end price points and i have found that once i have a solution for the sellers who cant sell they are so much more comfortable with buying my buyers are mostly word of mouth clients who have had recommendations from someone they know generally local professionals i always say people are always going to move to florida just like our family did and just like 90 of floridians i know were all from somewhere else why because we want to relax enjoy some fresh air have some quality in our life that we couldnt find in city living we live in central florida 30 minutes to a beach 30 minutes to a park where we can feel like were on vacation whenever we feel like what i love i can sell best what sort of units do you think investors should go for and why foreign buyers can do this when they want as their second home they can buy a property where they know the industry grows every year due to vacationers enjoy their time here and have the property looked after by a professional property manager i also do this as a service to my buyers and it gives them some relief to know that i can look after their property as my own i would recommend a foreign buyer to purchase a single family home with a pool or in a community with a pool are repossessions and foreclosures a way to invest i sell repossessions and foreclosures as long as the buyer understands it will be 99 as a as is sale and they would have to do a renovation project finally what are your 3 5 year projections of floridas property market i believe in 3 5 years the market will be just as strong as it was 2 years ago but we will all work with more caution and advise our buyers to be more cautious with more caution we can make sure that it doesnt cause this many foreclosures and losses to investors

4281815 un di logo estrat gico de largo alcance con rusia pero la conducta de este pa s pone en cuesti n toda la premisa de ese di logo
4281816 los rusos estaban preparados para aprovechar cualquier oportunidad y avanzaron agresivamente sobre osetia
4281817 el mensaje de mosc a todas las partes de la antigua uni n sovi tica fue una advertencia acerca de los esfuerzos por integrarse con occidente y de salirse de la tradicional esfera de influencia rusa
4281818 durante 45 a os hemos hecho grandes esfuerzos para evitar una confrontaci n militar con rusia
4281819 no veo que haya razones para cambiar ahora ese enfoque
4281820 tiene que haber consecuencias de las acciones emprendidas por rusia contra una naci n soberana
4281821 tiene inter s en reafirmar el estatus de rusia como gran potencia su tradicional esfera de influencias y en corregir lo que ellos los rusos ven como concesiones que se les impusieron despu s del colapso de la uni n sovi tica en la d cada de 1990
4281822 todas las naciones mirar n a rusia ahora de manera diferente por la acci n punitiva que lanz
4281823 hay inter s en que las tropas de pacificaci n salgan de europa
4281824 esperamos que rusia mantenga abiertas todas las l neas de comunicaci n y de transportes los puertos aeropuertos y caminos

4281830 government shutdown if the democratic led congress doesnt vote to lift a moratorium on new offshore oil drilling
4281831 if they want to shut down the government denying millions of senior citizens their social security checks in order to side with big oil companies then they should go right ahead
4281832 but as speaker gingrich found out the entire republican party will pay a terrible price in november for such a silly and desperate stunt
4281833 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4281834 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4281835 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4281836 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4281837 most of my friends are conservative republicans and they say im voting for barack mccain does not have a lock on the military vote thats for sure
4281838 well complete our duty im deploying next year because its a commitment i made to the nation not to a president but we all know that iraq was a big mistake

4281857 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks
4281858 the information security office has a policy of having a good discussion with campus users whose accounts have been compromised
4281859 rather than issue warnings we discuss what actually happened why it happened what the implications are and how users can prevent anything similar happening again
4281860 to prevent falling victim to these kind of scams the key message for any computer user is that they must treat all their logins and passwords with the same care as any other pin never give it out to any other person

4281893 you react to a film intellectually with your head and emotionally with your heart
4281894 but in a 3 d film you have a very strong physical component you can actually make your audience duck
4281895 i felt i had to do things i wouldnt do if i were making the same film in five years
4281896 people putting on 3 d glasses or paying a little extra to see a movie in 3 d at this point in cinema are expecting to have things blatantly launched into the audience
4281897 if the movie takes you somewhere that you dream about going to and probably arent going to get to it belongs in 3 d
4281898 if someone decides they want to do my dinner with andre in 3 d its not for us
4281899 i think it is a bit far fetched to always try to seek out a relationship
4281900 chinese artists who were working overseas have started to move back to china and hope to get more attention during the olympics
4281901 by 2000 people began to realise that there was not that much art available from the 1980s and 1990s so the value would be important and we saw many new collectors
4281902 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4281903 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
4281904 with windows 7 were trying to more carefully plan how we share information with our customers and partners this means sharing the right level of information at the right time depending on the needs of the audience
4281905 the reality is that enterprises are not frustrated with tape many of its inherent challenges have been addressed through more intelligent automated tape library systems
4281906 they cannot back up all the critical corporate data they need to with tape alone because there is more data to back up than ever before there is less planned downtime during which to complete backups and application owners want more frequent backups and faster restores
4281907 in a society where you cannot even buy cassette tapes any more as they are unreliable and known for getting chewed up in machines why are businesses still using tapes to back up their data
4281908 automated online backup means there is no need to physically move the data offsite which the business is charged to have removed and to bring back
4281909 smartways service provides a repeated revenue stream for its partners which can continually buy more storage when needed
4281910 partners buy aggregated storage from us which they can then distribute to each customer this means they do not have to keep coming to us for more space all the time and they can close deals faster
4281911 there is an attachment with tape which is why it will never die
4281912 it is selling more tapes than it has in a while and therefore is investing in developments around tape
4281913 switching to online backup means that the data does not have to be physically moved however it disregards the telecommunication charge it costs companies to virtually transport the data as with anything in it it is a trade off
4281914 tape still has its place even though other technologies are becoming more prevalent
4281915 the role of tape is changing and companies are increasingly looking to take advantage of the newer disk based technologies such as virtual tape libraries vtl and de duplication
4281916 tape being dead has to be one of the most commonly heard untruths in the market there are always claims that new technologies will eliminate tape from the it market and frankly this is not the case
4281917 tapes will not go away because there is always the need for retention but 2008 is the year for de duplication
4281918 all the industrys gorillas are investing in this technology emc partnered with quantum ibm acquired diligent technologies and sepaton has an oem agreement with hp
4281919 tape will still be in the market in five years time it is like a belt and braces for the industry
4281920 contracts are being given more insulation with tougher service level agreements and break out clauses
4281921 thats why you get to stick around a long time if you can handle it
4281922 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things

4281929 the 3g networking glitches may well be real but its worth pointing out that richard windsor is the same jackass who issued a report a year ago about the supposedly faulty

4281941 people are dissatisfied and some want to cause trouble but its also possible that terrorists planned this attack because during the olympics they can get more attention
4281942 and you wont be wrong in the eyes of the law if youre poor you dont have rights thats the way it is in china and its not fair
4281943 so far the threat of terrorism has been more from foreign countries
4281944 because of chinas policy of opening up terrorists have more opportunities to come to china and plan attacks but in the future social concerns within china not political ones will make attacks more common

4282036 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4282037 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income
4282038 it reflects the socio economic problems and low aspirations in places like the north east its part of a wider social story there are many more independent and selective schools in the southern half of the country than in the north
4282039 for many independent schools their reason for being is to get their results up but its just the result of creaming off the best by definition if you cream off the best you will get different results
4282040 there were 75 000 more entries in the maintained sector getting as at a level
4282041 this makes it more important for universities to take into account contextual information about a student when they apply
4282042 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap in achievement between different areas of the country the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind in school
4282043 there is now a clear divide at the heart of our education system ministers must work to find the reasons for this inequality and ensure that any improvements in our schools and colleges benefit all students
4282044 we are doing well but we need to do better at ensuring that every school in every part of the country benefits from those improvements
4282045 i think we should celebrate standards improving just as we would celebrate any olympic medal
4282046 everyone knows exactly what you have to do in every circumstance everyone tries to do it confident that everyone else is doing it and anyone who fails will be subjected to the justified scorn of everybody

4282053 we anticipate that situations in which fingerprint image quality is so poor that it is unusable will be extremely rare even in the 75 plus age group print quality is normally perfectly usable
4282054 on the very rare occasions when a fingerprint image falls below the quality required for automated matching it is passed to a fingerprint expert who carries out the coding manually so it can be stored on the database

4282060 since 9 11 our safety and security missions have grown considerably and we must continue to learn and increase our specialty knowledge by providing our personnel with the requisite skills
4282061 we have about four coast guard slots for a seal class in the february time frame
4282062 nashua therefore may not raise rates unless there is a cost basis for doing so and the commission approves such an increase
4282063 as to ensuring these customers receive the same quality and quantity of water as customers located within nashua we note that being on the core system these customers take service from the same distribution system that supplies inside customers thus core customers residing outside nashua will receive the same quality and quantity of water as customers residing inside nashua
4282064 nashua agrees to apply its water ordinance including the main extension policy in the ordinance in a manner that does not discriminate between customers inside and outside of nashua
4282065 i dont think the regional water district was part of the ruling
4282066 i dont believe necessarily that government should be involved in running a business
4282067 to produce our beers anheuser busch needs a high quality and reliable water supply at a predictable price
4282068 pennichuck has met that need for more than 35 years the city of nashua stated before the puc that they would continue to provide our brewery with satisfactory water service and we have no reason to believe otherwise
4282069 the unfortunate part of it is all the legal fees on both sides which would only add to the trauma of the whole thing
4282070 people are dissatisfied and some want to cause trouble but its also possible that terrorists planned this attack because during the olympics they can get more attention
4282071 and you wont be wrong in the eyes of the law if youre poor you dont have rights thats the way it is in china and its not fair
4282072 so far the threat of terrorism has been more from foreign countries
4282073 because of chinas policy of opening up terrorists have more opportunities to come to china and plan attacks but in the future social concerns within china not political ones will make attacks more common

4282081 it seems that he was concerned that the bacon actually might have been a bomb planted by his estranged wife who packed it for him
4282082 and i thought that would be a cool story to write about i thought the best way to do that was to actually go through a tryout instead of just writing about it i had no intention of making the team i hadnt played football since the fifth grade so that idea didnt even cross my mind
4282083 little did i know that i would get a call saying that i made the team
4282084 i knew that it would be physically exhausting so i wanted to get in some shape
4282085 so i ran a couple miles a day for a few weeks but nothing too serious
4282086 i think that everything was new to me all the football stuff like running 40 yard dashes i never ran a 40 yard dash before that was new and doing all the agility drills like running around cones and backpedaling that was hard for me because i had never done it before
4282087 i specifically remember coach carroll making some comment and coach norton the linebackers coach making a comment they were all going oh its the newspaper guy they all knew me from the school newspaper
4282088 they were going to post a list of those who made the team two days later
4282089 i was going to go in right when it was posted just to get a reaction from all the other people that tried out and made the team i wanted to see how those guys were i wasnt going to go check it to see if i had made it
4282090 i actually got a phone call from a friend who was walking by heritage hall a few minutes before i was going to go in she asked if i had tried out for the team i said yeah but it was just for a story then she said well you made it i thought she was joking so i just laughed it off she was like no im serious you made it and then it just hit me like a ton of bricks
4282091 it just takes your breath away you just go into shock it was insane i couldnt breathe so i ran over because i wanted to check it for myself and there it was but then again i thought it was a joke from coach carroll because i had known him for a few years from covering the team i thought maybe hes just pulling a prank on me
4282092 he said no im serious i want you on the team youre quick and youve got good hands that was when i was like wow this is real so thats a no brainer its not like youre going to turn down that offer
4282093 before that first practice im just psyching myself out hows it going to feel like if i get hit by an all american linebacker but once that first hit comes just like when youre on a roller coaster youre going okay that wasnt too bad so thats football then you feel like youve made it you got hit its sort of like an initiation
4282094 even harder than the physical side of it and getting hit and then obviously its demanding conditioning wise and strength wise but much harder than all of that is the mental side of it
4282095 where are you going to play youve got to be so focused all the time when youre out there because the play is twenty seconds long then you have to go back and run another play and you have to know exactly where to line up and where to go how youre going to work with the guy next to you
4282096 when youre not on the field or youre not in meetings you re sitting there studying the playbook trying to learn it its such a challenge especially for someone who didnt have that background in football
4282097 during practices i was on the scout team playing wide receiver and helping our defense week in and week out it was pretty cool though because that year 2006 we had dwayne jarrett and steve smith as our top receivers
4282098 those are two all americans right there just to be on the same squad as those guys was pretty cool they just had so much knowledge of the game getting to learn from them that was awesome
4282099 when youre going through it and you put that uniform on and you walk out the tunnel on a saturday at the coliseum that is the highest of all highs right there you think nothing can be better than all of this
4282100 obviously itd be cool to get in a game but youre just so grateful to put on that cardinal and gold jersey and to represent the trojans even as a walk on and you dont get to play
4282101 im not expecting to get in a game at all its just such a great opportunity its not like if i didnt get into a game itd be a failure of a year its not like that at all it was the greatest experience even without getting into a game
4282102 it was the last play of the game it was a quarterback kneel it wasnt like i caught the winning touchdown pass or anything like that but its still an official play and it goes down that i got that one play in the scorebook
4282103 getting into a game that just added that little something extra i mean it wasnt little at all it was huge getting called in and playing that one play against notre dame that was just a storybook ending
4282104 after i finished playing i was looking for a job i came to coach carroll and it was really being at the right place at the right time because he was looking to start a new website for himself and for the football team called uscripsit com
4282105 i didnt even ask him about a job or anything he just said you know what youd be the perfect person to run this site
4282106 it was just an ideal situation for me i had just finished up my degree and being able to stay connected with the team and on campus that was perfect
4282107 because we have so much room to run with this and were going into uncharted territory in terms of providing fans a look at the trojans no sports team has done something like this where its so behind the scenes and so connected with the team and just minute by minute too
4282108 they really enjoy the access that it provides and the personality it has it really adds a lot to the whole experience of being a fan and its been really cool being in charge of that
4282109 one of the main goals of the site is to get a better l a out there more
4282110 anything that we sell on uscripsit com the proceeds go towards

4282114 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4282115 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered

4282133 we had an extended amount of time here where we tried to improve his situation it didnt seem like we were getting very far it was very unfortunate
4282134 he was anxious to really start his career over and we thought this was the right situation we worked him out he was in outstanding shape we didn t think there was going to be any down time whatsoever

4282162 the appointment of kevin odea as special teams coach who is more of a punting specialist has certainly helped me out
4282163 last year i had to get a job and i was fighting hard for that
4282164 the pressure was that i had to show what i can do this year i have to maintain and improve on every little bit

4282180 logan wants to help us win logans a gunner on the punt team while working on being a punt return man
4282181 hes also working on some other roles hes been working as a safety on the kickoff team and kick return and i dont know if coach tony ball has him working there or not but hes got at least three roles that hes working on he just wants to help us win

4282187 were still sorting it out and theres other seasons youre generally sure that a guy wont be ready to play but every one of these defensive backs will play including makiri pugh ankle because i think once hes healthy he has shown that hes able to understand the concepts pretty quick

4282223 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4282224 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4282225 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4282227 i have been arranging these things called synchroblogs for about a year and a half now its kind of a stupid name which i came up with to define the experience and during the olympic season it sounds like two guys trying to dive together in unison or a group of ladies doing ballet while floating in a pool with nose plugs on but a synchroblog is neither of those things one may need to wear nose plugs while reading the compendium of thoughts provided by the wildly divergent list of stinkers uhm i mean thinkers because we are bound to challenge your sensibilities and perhaps even bend your sense of orthodoxy our synchroblog is formed around a predominently christian group of bloggers who like the idea of changing or at least provoking our little corner of the world so we all write about the same general subject and release our thoughts on the same day thus it is a synchronized blogging event a synchroblog are you interested in being a synchroblogger if so you can go to our synchroblog list server and sign up to get updates mailed to you and join the discussions of upcoming synchroblog events so what are you waiting for join the provokers
4282228 my feeling is that it hasnt been a good year again
4282229 wind farms were a hot topic at the last symposium
4282230 in germany there are turbines above forests and the mortality rate of bats has been found to be high
4282231 in scotland it was thought to be less of a problem because turbines tend to be in wide open spaces where bats are less likely to be
4282232 one of the concerns is that the blades turn so fast the bats cant detect them and another is a change in pressure which it is believed to damage the bats internally
4282233 events are being held all over scotland and europe and the bat walks that are held are one of the most helpful things we can do
4282234 there have been people who have found a bat in trouble and able to get it help because a neighbour went on one of the walks and knew what to do
4282235 el verano en ee uu es una poca ideal para una producci n para la familia y adem s como cualquier otro estudio a n sufrimos la repercusi n del paro de los guionistas que retras algunas producciones y cambi el panorama de la competencia en 2009
4282236 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4282237 its real strength is in providing a rich framework that developers can easily build upon optimize collaborate around and then deploy on billions of devices
4282238 in this way lwuit is becoming a unifying ui layer that allows developers to focus on creating compelling user interfaces and ultimately delivering new and engaging applications across a wide range of platforms
4282239 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly
4282240 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4282241 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa quality assurance and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4282242 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
4282243 this piece of code was left over from the prerelease versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2
4282244 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
4282245 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
4282246 there is special place in hell for women that dont support other women
4282247 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4282248 all you left wing bloggers who want to smear mr corsi
4282249 theres over 300 pages 700 footnotes and ill stand by the truth of every statement in this book
4282250 a large number of e mails were received from readers objecting that obama was not the messiah but rather the biblical antichrist prefigured in saint johns apocalypse
4282251 i had to read it about six times before i began to figure it out
4282252 why obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4282253 what is obama trying to hide and why would he do so
4282254 that obamas father was a polygamist and an alcoholic may or may not tell us much about obama
4282255 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather missing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
4282256 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
4282257 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
4282258 never states precisely how many wives his father had or how many half brothers and sisters he has from different mothers
4282259 sayid obama was not even sure how many wives his brother had
4282260 obama blames racism for breaking up his parents marriage not his fathers polygamist ways
4282261 obama is again lying about history to claim jfk had anything to do with bringing his father to the united states to study
4282262 obama senior following the prescripts of islamic sharia law divorced
4282263 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
4282264 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4282265 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family
4282266 what would be heard by most listeners is that obama hates the military so much that he might leave the united states defenseless against our enemies
4282267 i did not see my brother practice islam especially after he came back from his studies in the united states
4282268 there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing
4282269 obama did attend a government run public school in indonesia and he did receive islamic instruction including study of the koran
4282270 barack obama is not and never has been a muslim
4282271 that physical description does not match the indonesia television news videos showing the house
4282272 it is hard to decipher what obama might be trying to hide by not being clear about the specific location of the houses where he lived in jakarta
4282273 the black man who tried to peel off his skin
4282274 advertisements in the negro magazines still hymn nadinola skin bleach lightens and brightens skin
4282275 the entire episode suggests what psychologists call hypothetical lying in other words imagining something that has not happened but imagining it with so much precise detail that the made up memory functions for the person as if it were real
4282276 has obama lost the ability to tell the difference between something that actually happened and something he invented
4282277 after the date obama wants us to think he left indonesia
4282278 the puzzle just adds to the growing list of factual discrepancies or outright fabrications that obama manufactures very likely on an ongoing basis
4282279 if we cant trust you to remember which magazine you read in indonesia when you were 9 how can we possibly ever trust you to protect our country
4282280 asked me to run as its presidential candidate in 2008
4282281 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4282282 didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal grandparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4282283 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband
4282284 the race obama embraces is not that of his mother although he does have that choice
4282285 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4282286 if obama does win the presidency in 2008 he will be the first president in our history to have an extended family in another country
4282287 we cant yet get the authentic birth certificate im convinced its a forgery
4282288 if a birth certificate were forged and put on a website its conceivable that somebody committed a felony
4282289 president bush intends to abrogate u s sovereignty to the north american union a new economic and political entity which the president is quietly forming why doesnt president bush just tell the truth his secret agenda is to dissolve the united states of america into the north american union
4282290 nobody has worked harder to convince people that the completely moronic north american conspiracy theory is real
4282291 many of the black rage paragraphs obama wrote in dreams from my father bear a striking resemblance to passages frantz fanon wrote in his first book black skin white masks
4282292 ray assured me that we would never talk about whites without knowing exactly what we were doing without knowing that there might be a price to pay
4282293 for several years certain laboratories have been trying to produce a serum for denegrification
4282294 frantz fanons revolutionary writings were instrumental in shaping obamas own political analysis of race
4282295 we do not know if obama senior ever shared fanons writings with his son but much of the expression of black resentment obama offers in dreams from my father appears strongly influenced by fanons pages
4282296 obama railed against the same forms of racial oppression his father must have felt under british colonialism
4282297 the use of change as a political slogan dates back to socialist saul alinsky and his desire to cause a radical redistribution of income from the haves to the have nots in america
4282298 obama has borrowed phrases freely even from movies taking bamboozled from spike lees movie about malcolm x and the phrase he is the one from the matrix movie series
4282299 is a plagiarist plain and simple he cannot be trusted
4282300 likes to present himself as the distinguished professor of education at the university of illinois at chicago
4282301 could easily block obama from the white house and not just in 2008 but forever
4282302 in his eleven year reign of underground terror ayers participated in thirty bombings
4282303 palmer would never have introduced obama to the hyde park political community at the ayres dohrn home unless she saw an affinity between ayers and dohrns radical leftist history her own history of far leftist politics and the politics of barack obama
4282304 either he did not know ayers and dohrn are still radical leftists in which case he is implausibly naive or obama did know which would confirm he joined with ayers and dohrn because obama too continues to believe albeit silently and secretly in the far lefts radical agenda
4282305 even today ayers appears to hold the same radical political beliefs he did in the weather underground and obama had to know that was also the case when he first met ayers in 1995
4282306 mccarthy era committees seeking to expose communists considered to be a security threat
4282307 when obama tells audiences that his community organizing experience taught me a lot about listening to people as opposed to coming with a premeditated agenda he is reciting pure alinsky dogma
4282308 conservative columnist ann coulter has characterized obamas dreams from my father as a dimestore mein kampf
4282309 obama engages in what appears to be animated conversation with the professor
4282310 bookcase in the quincy house dorm included titles by karl marx and howard zinn
4282311 the socialist viewpoint is a magazine published by the socialist workers organization a group that describes itself as formed to advance the revolutionary marxist political program in the united states
4282312 little green footballs has called graham felsen a hardcore marxist
4282313 exactly what is a democratic candidate doing with a staffer who acts as the campaigns publics face when the staffer is featured in marxist publications
4282314 how possibly can obama argue his association with radicals such as bill ayers and bernardine dohrn was a long time ago when he continues to recruit a marxist sympathizer such as sam graham felsen to be an official blogger of his 2008 presidential campaign
4282315 reverend wright adapted the phrase to imply that the terrorist attacks of 9 11 were divine retribution for white americas continuing racial injustice
4282316 how could obama know these were the subjects of wrights sermons unless he had heard them
4282317 before obamas baptism at trinity when he was nearly thirty years old there is no other life incident evidencing he is a christian
4282318 a calculated decision to position yourself favorably in the eyes of those you want to lead whether you believe in the decision or not
4282319 along with other prominent black leaders such as al sharpton and barack obama farrakhan helped lead the million man march on washington
4282320 obamas supporters who clearly want to move obama as far away from farrakhan as possible will be certain to disavow that obama had any leadership role in farrakhans 1995 march
4282321 obamas 2006 trip to kenya evidenced his continued ties to a raila odinga a fellow luo tribesman who was running for president of kenya as a muslim sympathizer with well known communist political roots
4282322 obama by being seen this prominently with odinga in public had injected himself into the presidential contest on the side of his tribesman
4282323 senator obama has continued to insert himself into kenyan politics
4282324 morriss showing up in kenya makes no sense outside the obama odinga connection
4282325 morris had been openly critical of hillary clintons campaign against obama
4282326 as we shall see rezko was persistent ultimately convincing obama to drop working for political organizing causes so he could supplement the dwindling advance he had received at harvard to write a book with real income as a lawyer working the small chicago law firm where the lead partner did much of rezkos slumlord legal work for him
4282327 obama could work for rezko indirectly and benefit from rezkos connections
4282328 the likelihood is that rezko played a role in getting obama to join davis miner barnhill amp galland
4282329 alinsky taught that power was everything and that image words and positioning were just methods to capture power working from communities up
4282330 took steps that helped davis and rezko in their business relationship
4282331 continued to work for a law firm that had rezko as a client
4282332 there is no record that illinois state senator obama ever so much as placed a speech in the record objecting to the public housing practices perpetuated in his district by tony rezko let alone calling for investigation of rezko and his business practices
4282333 in an article titled obama is one lucky fellow rezko watch found it was unlikely that sreenan would actually construct any condos on the lot he had bought from rita rezko
4282334 even if no illegality is ever identified obamas continued willingness to take campaign contributions from his friend rezko even after serious allegations about rezkos low income housing empire began to be raised have the feel of impropriety
4282335 investigative reporters have drawn a line from obama to rezko to saddam husseins oil for food scandal with the key connecting point being billionaire nadhmi auchi
4282336 overlooked rezkos questionable activities to take money not just to finance his campaigns but to buy the mansion he feels his family deserves
4282337 if he sticks to the issues mccain will defeat barack obama
4282338 video clips that show his saying he wants to reduce the military
4282339 america seeks a world in which there are no nuclear weapons
4282340 he gave his famous antiwar speech in october 2002 but didnt officially declare his candidacy for the u
4282341 obama has consistently refused to support legislation that would define an infant who survives a late term induced labor abortion as a human being with the right to live
4282342 he insists that no restriction must ever be placed on the right of a mother to decide to abort her child
4282343 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion
4282344 the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more
4282345 the economics of this principle have been proved repeatedly in the two decades since reagan was president
4282346 obama quietly steered his global poverty act known as s
4282347 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4282348 obama fails to hold hand over heart during national anthem
4282349 kempsey is the furthest points of supply on the east coast from brisbane and sydney giving it the most expensive freight price
4282350 we use a skimming method of keeping our petrol tank three quarters full because of prices
4282351 but then when the oil prices just dropped suddenly like they did this year a lot of people got caught with their pants down
4282352 i might turn over a tank a month where as the major outlets could turn over a tank load in a couple of days
4282353 see if i dont deliver some savings to the local community then i just cant even get hot now
4282354 legally they may not have a responsibility to consult the population but morally i think they do
4282355 were not sure what happened but from what i was told the pipe which burst was only 30 years old
4282356 the general life expectancy of those pipes is 80 years
4282357 the school remained opened but we asked parents to seek alternative arrangements for the day where possible for health reasons
4282358 they provided us with 200 water bottles for the students and also a portable tank for fresh water and the toilets
4282359 well be doing a review of the valves and when we do that where possible well assess the main
4282360 the club has already hosted the likes of the fiji national side and the australian under 17 team in training matches
4282361 with the national set up now part of the asian federation this is the opportunity for kempsey to provide first rate facilities
4282362 and hopefully in the event of australia hosting the afc asian cup or even the world cup to become a base for one of the qualifying squads
4282363 were trying to look at things 10 to 15 years ahead
4282364 were looking to the council and local businesses to get behind us because the facilities will not only assist the club and local youngsters but also help kempsey economically
4282365 if we can attract big name teams to the area for extended training camps there will be opportunities for those in the likes of the catering and accommodation sectors to benefit from the entourages that make up these groups
4282366 i dont understand why there are the huge differences up and down the coast
4282367 the prices are all over the place theres no rhyme or reason to it and nobody seems to be able to give us an answer as to why this is happening
4282368 the petrol market is very competitive and sites are always competing with each other for volume
4282369 in regional areas the economics of running a site are very different from running a metropolitan site
4282370 in regional sites the volume can be a fraction of the volume put through a large metropolitan site and shop sales would also be significantly lower
4282371 i referred the high cost of petrol prices on the mid north coast to the accc some time back because i felt there wasnt fair competition and prices didnt reflect proper practice
4282372 their response was they could find no collusion among retailers or anti competitive action that would breach the trade practices act
4282373 the cost of fuel at the service station on the highway at port is outrageously high
4282374 he can charge what the market will pay with travellers
4282375 unfortunately that sets a benchmark for what kempsey can sell
4282376 i think ultimately prices will come down once the retailers have worked through the higher priced product the cost of fuel should start to drop
4282377 weve had an acknowledgement from the commonwealth that theyll look into it
4282378 i can still picture him on the side of the hill at east kempsey
4282379 we were fielding down the hill and bradman was batting on this pitch
4282380 he hit one down the hill and i took my straw hat off to try and catch it and i almost went out of the ground with it
4282381 my father and i had to swim 30 of our milking cattle from pola creek to red hill so they had a safe place to stay
4282382 i retired from school when i was 14 years old
4282383 working at nestle i met and made many great friends
4282384 our factory would travel to sydney to play lawn bowls with the other nestle factory in sydney
4282385 i started at 12 oclock at night and would sometimes get a flat tyre so i would have to push it or just keep riding it
4282386 it was the first time i had gone overseas and it was the last time
4282387 a man from bellbrook would ride a horse from up river giving information about the flood being on its way down

4282389 believes that president bush is trying to merge the united states with mexico and canada
4282390 corsi has penned a litany of bigoted hateful comments crossing the line so thoroughly that even the right wing operatives behind swift boat veterans for truth disavowed him this is a man who smears the catholic church calls the pope senile and regularly demeans public servants in vile sexual and racial terms
4282391 in short his record of attacks is disgusting and false and so is this book
4282392 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4282393 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family she was an immediate success there as well in part because the number of luo words in her vocabulary very soon surpassed mine we had a fine time in alego helping auma on a film project of hers listening to more of grannys stories meeting relatives id missed the first time around
4282394 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4282395 he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed
4282396 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book without their constant love and support without their willingness to let me sing their song and their toleration of the occasional wrong note i could never have hoped to finish if nothing else i hope that the love and respect i feel for them shines through on every page
4282397 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4282398 oh another page out of the gary hart monkey business book
4282399 we will always listen to one anothers point of view
4282400 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4282401 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4282402 everyone was happy but here are people spending time trying to find something wrong they have dug up a regulation

4282468 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4282469 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles

4282518 we couldnt get anyone hot out there thats what it comes down to we got the lead we did what we wanted to do out there

4282590 tensions between the united states and russia sharpened as the bush administration suggested that russias objective is the ousting of president mikhail saakashvili who has close ties to the united states and is seeking admission to nato
4282591 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4282592 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4282593 as far as the georgians are concerned south ossetia and abkhazia are simply part of their national territory to be recovered at all costs promises by nato leaders to bring georgia into the alliance and ostentatious declarations of support from washington have emboldened saakashvili to launch his military offensive against the two provinces south ossetia and abkhazia saakashvili and likely dick cheneys office in washington appear to have miscalculated very badly russia has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding its support for south ossetia or abkhazia
4282594 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
4282595 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
4282596 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia

4282598 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
4282599 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4282600 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion
4282601 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
4282602 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
4282603 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
4282604 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4282605 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4282606 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4282607 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4282608 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4282609 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4282610 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4282611 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
4282612 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
4282613 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
4282614 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances
4282615 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia

4282617 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4282618 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4282619 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4282620 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4282621 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4282622 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4282623 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4282624 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4282625 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4282626 yeah but everyones hair structure is different so i cant promise itll look like the picture

4282654 its a celebration of oneness and an opportunity to help heal the world
4282655 although weve been participating in world day of prayer for 15 years this is our first year hosting 11 days of activities centered on inclusion and interfaith acceptance

4282674 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost effective with solar thermal and wind energy
4282675 we sure would like to see the tax credits delivered as soon as possible the uncertainty is having an impact across the solar spectrum especially in the commercial sector
4282676 depending on the timing there are a bunch of dynamics that i can divulge because those are details in the contract
4282677 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4282679 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4282680 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4282681 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4282682 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4282683 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4282694 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4282695 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4282696 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4282697 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4282698 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change
4282699 the federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesnt mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides
4282700 this opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet that even though money doesnt change hands attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy

4282753 i came by here last year and its always great to meet the kids and see what theyre up to
4282754 they start asking you on day one whos going to be here when are they going to be here so at the end of the week its a lot of fun for them because this is the highlight of their whole camp
4282755 you get here about half an hour before your session starts come on the ice get all the drills set up and just work with the kids and be their friend for the week
4282756 ive coached in more hockey schools than participated in them and if i could have done something like this when i was a kid it would have made my life

4282790 matt guzzetta a companion to don vesco at the don vesco products decided to built the most fuel efficient motorcycle in the world the year was 1981 and matts goal was to win the craig vetters economy run high mileage contest held on trafficked highway in california usa between san luis obisco and laguna seca raceway by monterey matt guzzetta called his bike the project 200 his goal was to ride 200 us miles on a gallon of gasoline 1 175 l 100 km there had been vehicles that had already achieved the goal gut not with a street legal motorcycle with all the equipment required for riding on roads light flashers rear mirrors and such it took matt three months to build his machine he used a single cylinder two stroke engine of a suzuki gn125 that was later modified with help from the famous trim expert popsyoshimura but the first thing to do was to modify the transmission ratios to get most of every drop of fuel by letting the engine run on its most fuel efficient revs magazine article of matt guzzettas and don vescos project bike published in swedish allt om mc january 1983 according to a magazine article from early 1983 pops yoshimura was going to use ceramic and synthetic materials on some of the engine parts unfortunately i dont know what modifications were actually made to the engine by the time the article was published matt guzzetta had calculated that after the engine trim the bike could probably manage 260 miles per gallon 0 905 l 100 km perhaps even 300 mpg 0 784 l 100 km now we know that the bike could not run that long with only a gallon of fuel pops yoshimura had not touched the engine by the time matt guzzetta participated the high mileage contest the result 152 31 mpg 1 544 l 100 km suzuki gn125 had quite small front brake drum before matt modified it it was replaced with a larger one to compensate the rear brake that was removed when matt modified the rear wheel instead of the drum brake matt mounted a starting engine freewheeling system from a suzuki gs1100 into the rear wheel the system let the wheel spin freely when riding downhill it the chain rotated slower than the wheel naturally to save fuel matt guzzetta told back in 1982 that although the high mileage suzuki can be ridden on the road it is not a practical bike it cannot be leaned that much in corners because of the shape of the aerodynamic fairing that also makes the vehicle very sensitive for side wind a powerful blow of wind could lift me and the bike in the air and throw us to the ocean matt told in the interview the reason why i am building this machine is to find out a way to get better fuel efficiency for motorcycles with the help of aerodynamics we will learn from our experiences and use the knowledge on normal motorcycles when we are done he continued matt had already experimented with a suzuki gs1000g shaftie by building and mounting an aerodynamic fairing to it he managed to lower the fuel consumption by 22 on highway speed

4282842 simulates 60 particles at a time as they travel around the ring and runs the simulation for 100 000 to 1 000 000 loops around the ring to test whether the beam is going to remain on a stable orbit for a much longer time or risks losing control and flying off course into the walls of the vacuum tube a very serious problem that could result in the machine being stopped for repairs if it happens in real life by repeating such calculations thousands of times it is possible to map out the conditions under which the beam should be stable
4282843 the new study is an extension of previous simulations we want to evaluate the long term beam stability in the lhc in the presence of unknown or partially corrected magnetic imperfections i e small field errors in the magnet elements this scenario must be expected especially in the first few years of the lhc and in particular during its startup in 2007 an essential part of this study is therefore the definition and test of a dedicated configuration for the lhc commissioning the necessary resources for such a study are available only within the lhc home project

4282861 is an application that simulates neurons each downloaded work unit generates 100 000 biophysical neurons because the simulator is in an initial phase and we have very few cellular models implemented we can only use it to test for simulations capacity to date the largest brain simulation has been done on a cluster of 27 machines with 100 billion neurons simulated over a period of 50 days while it was a very interesting experiment which pushed the frontier further on it was a partial simulation only in the sense that many of the required components were not implemented due to hardware constraints

4282871 the number field sieve to find the factors of increasingly large numbers
4282872 in general when k has many small factors n is more likely to produce a prime because it cant have those same factors
4282873 found a 42 digit factor of m 5280 using gmp ecm with b 3m this is expected to qualify for 9th place in paul zimmermans top ten this year list
4282874 the second known factor for the primitive part of this number
4282875 uses gimps program prime95 to work on all primitives of m 3326400 simultaneously if any ecm work is going to be done on the largest composites prime95 is much faster the subfactor composites are then tested for free however even with prime95 it takes a long time to run ecm curves on large numbers
4282876 removing prime candidates for the remaining 68 ks from a huge dat file the dat file contains n values from a current low of about 1 700 000 to a high of 20 000 000 per remaining k individual sieving efforts per single k can take two weeks to a month to sieve to a sufficient level this coordinated sieving effort will allow us to sieve 100 times deeper and much quicker no more sieving to 3t and stopping in frustration as the hours per factor mount now we can go to 300t and beyond

4282963 its time for the spiritual fathers to step up and help todd bentley the former leader of the revival that has come to be known as the
4282964 i dont get how anybody can buy into this spin on things
4282965 pardon my scepticism but he might just have well submitted to the authority of his own demonic emma as this bunch
4282966 unless of course he were actually operating under the sustaining power of the holy spirit this is just an excuse
4282967 this tells me more by what it doesnt say than what it does note the lack of mention of the false teachings that they must have overlooked its all about moral shortcomings thus the issue they have with bentley is all about his marriage falling apart while the lies and false teachings and doctrines of demons have never been a problem and still arent
4282968 that might indeed be a big help were he not asking for this statement from people who are just as messed up as bentley ever was if not more so
4282969 is it also full of stories about god using flawed theology and doctrines of demons
4282970 the predominate theme here is how we should or shouldnt deal with todd bentleys fall into sin as per his marriage breakdown

4282976 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4282977 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot mr collins said
4282978 the most bonkers invention here is the coffee cooler he said of the circa 1920 metal cylinder which would be plunged into a piping hot cup

4282982 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go he said

4283008 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4283009 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4283010 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4283011 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4283012 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4283013 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4283014 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4283015 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4283016 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4283017 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4283018 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4283019 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4283020 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4283021 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4283022 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4283023 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4283024 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4283025 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4283026 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4283027 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4283028 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4283029 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4283031 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4283032 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

4283038 cerpenista itu situs yang dibuat oleh kawan saya herman saksono blogger yang tinggal di yogyakarta cerpenista menyediakan layanan menulis cerita pendek sambung menyambung secara daring atawa online writing melalui cerpenista seorang blogger dapat menulis cerita bersama blogger lain yang belum tentu saling mengenal melalui jaringan internet sabtu pekan lalu cerpenista secara resmi diperkenalkan ke publik di yogyakarta pada acara itu herman juga mengumumkan kerja samanya dengan pt dagdigdug indonesia penyedia layanan sebagai tempat bernaung cerpenista
4283039 oh keren juga ya lalu bagaimana caranya agar saya bisa ikut menulis mas
4283040 sampean harus mendaftar dulu secara daring online ke situs cerpenista gratis kok setelah mendapat persetujuan dari admin sampean baru bisa menyumbang tulisan tapi tulisan sampean ndak boleh panjang bukan dalam bentuk satu cerpen utuh setiap posting dibatasi maksimal 250 karakter di kolom yang sudah disediakan sampean juga baru bisa menulis lagi setelah kalimat buatan sampean tadi diteruskan oleh penulis lain
4283041 memang begitu perbedaan cerpenista dengan situs cerpen lain yang sudah ada sebelumnya misalnya situs fanstory di cerpenista seorang anggota adalah penggagas cerita penulis sutradara sekaligus pembaca anggota ikut menentukan tema alur dan plot cerita

4283057 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves

4283068 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4283069 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4283070 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4283071 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4283072 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start

4283080 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among pre school children
4283081 the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4283082 there may well be some other common factor in obesity

4283084 it is possible for there to be a link between otitis externa a different form of ear infection and obesity because of the connection between obesity and type ii diabetes which can contribute to this condition
4283085 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancer than all the other gene mutations discovered so far the reasonable expectation is that this will save some lives
4283086 if confirmed in larger studies this finding brings us another step closer towards unravelling the inherited risk of bowel cancer
4283087 licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies
4283088 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4283089 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
4283090 new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce
4283091 i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research
4283092 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering
4283093 we have to feed him so he gains weight and you have to walk him around so that he knows what to do
4283094 ive done a lamb and dairy cows but this is my first year with a steer

4283097 i barely registered today i lost my schedule and things arent going good i dont know where my classes are or anything
4283098 kids are out of the halls kids are in classes teachers are getting to know kids more important that you are in an english 10 class and its not as crucial that they are in the right period

4283107 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4283108 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4283109 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4283110 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4283111 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4283112 im confident the air quality will not pose major problems
4283113 youre pedalling away not even making an effort and the sweat is pouring off you in places where you never thought you could sweat that much you look down at your legs and its just pouring off you
4283114 when i finished riding my skin wasnt dirty its just really humid so its hard to breathe its like being at really high altitude
4283115 the ground gets wet and you get some heat on it and it just evaporates it was the temperature and the humidity that caught a lot of guys out and if you think about it pollution doesnt come and go the rain might come but the pollution would stay

4283124 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so that it is not a quota but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced continue to experience and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life
4283125 how will the democratic candidate deal with potentially divisive ballot initiatives calling for an end to affirmative action
4283126 the next test of barack obamas postracial persona may come from some unlikely places arizona colorado missouri nebraska and oklahoma thats where ward connerly the countrys most innovative and successful opponent of affirmative action over the past decade is launching an effort to get an initiative on the ballots that would prohibit public institutions from considering race sex or ethnicity in areas such as hiring and college admissions

4283129 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
4283130 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4283131 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now

4283140 more people have been coming in to find out how they can reduce their risk of cancer
4283141 people can touch on all sorts of information and support around diagnosis advice on early detection and screening and our research process
4283142 we have displays around the truck on knowing your skin and also nutrition and tobacco
4283143 laptops are available to access information on the cancer council website and on others to find what youre looking for
4283144 we have seen several cancer patients and family members who we were able to put in touch with our services like our hotline 131120 and online
4283145 we believe no one should be isolated just because of their cancer or because they live in rural nsw
4283146 if youve missed us on the truck we will be in manilla on friday and barraba saturday
4283147 you can call the helpline theres no question too silly to ask and no question too complex

4283159 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4283160 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4283161 it fell in the right direction it just did not fall at the right time

4283164 we extend our deepest sympathy to the harveys and the family of the iron workers
4283165 it reminds us that the work they do is still dangerous work its a sobering reminder of that fact
4283166 he got crushed i dont believe it though i heard hes dead
4283167 i have a half dozen representatives down there on the job
4283168 all we can do now is pray the best i can figure out is that they were taking out a single section down and something went awry a section cut loose
4283169 a very unique job it is a huge dismantling job not like what everyday ironworkers do which is put up buildings there are a lot of unique factors and it is quite an engineering feat
4283170 he was candid forthcoming and easily accessible hallmarks of good damage control when a company is under the gun
4283171 the real problem is how apple is responding for a company thats so brilliant at marketing it seems to have absolutely no clue about crisis management
4283172 and a recent study shows that immigrant assimilation is happening faster now than it did 100 years ago when the bulk of the immigrants spoke english and looked like every other mayflower descendent two thirds of third generation immigrants speak english only
4283173 those who will think mexico first into the 7th generation
4283174 americans who identify themselves as hispanic black asian american indian native hawaiian and pacific islander will together outnumber non hispanic whites
4283175 we talk about it all the time but its really really true
4283176 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4283177 they really believe because of their age and agility that that makes up for lack of experience that their reflexes are faster and theyre stronger physically
4283178 and so they believe theyre better drivers in fact than older people who have a lot more experience
4283179 it shows them first hand that this too could happen to you
4283180 with all the work that weve done with teens this is really reinforcing what they tell us anecdotally
4283181 they do have a feeling that theyre invincible its always someone else whos the bad driver not them and its really difficult to get them to understand the consequences of bad choices
4283182 you cant just have a program for the teens you cant just show it to them once
4283183 but when you look at it very carefully its usually not bad luck its usually someone has made a bad choice someone has chosen to drink and drive chosen not to wear seatbelts or to speed or be out on a lake at midnight when theres no light
4283184 so its never just one person who loses their life its the whole family losing a child losing a loved one losing a parent it is tragic and it shakes the whole family and they never ever recover
4283185 i shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham

4283212 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response
4283213 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
4283214 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
4283215 all we know is that the iphone downloads a list of malicious urls
4283216 for all we know it could trigger world war 3 or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
4283217 truly malicious software is going to find a way to burrow deeper into the iphones operating system so that a simple mechanism like this wouldnt affect it so really the only type of applications this could effectively kill off are applications that are annoying to apple but not malicious that certainly calls for a lot more concern

4283251 dont forget this is faster than ethernet so all of a sudden usb 3 becomes a very viable way to connect external drives that will be as fast if not faster than an internal
4283252 some notebooks werent living up to battery life and the only difference was one had a webcam which turned out to be a usb device internally that caused the usb ports to stay active and thus drain the battery
4283253 we have re issued the entire esx esxi 3 5 update 2 release
4283254 their biggest failing was they didnt immediately communicate that problem
4283255 they knew about this problem very early in the morning and i didnt get my notification until 6 p m on that day
4283256 it was dumb and were not used to vmware doing dumb things
4283257 if i was a vmware partner id be justly irked
4283258 for many years now weve not had anything like this on the esx platform and people take it as a matter of fact that its a relatively stable platform
4283259 every platform has its share of bugs but this is the first time weve seen anything like this from vmware
4283260 well encourage vmware to ensure they do their best with respect to quality control

4283265 for me family comes first they have always helped me with everything it is important that they are very well like me
4283266 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4283267 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4283268 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4283269 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4283270 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4283271 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4283272 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january 2008 was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4283273 he is not completely 100 at the moment he is still recovering a bit from pre season problems but hopefully nasri can be back in the squad
4283274 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game diaby will take four to six weeks as we have said and we dont know about senderos yet
4283275 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people
4283276 i will keep going with what i do best and going into my third season i have the feeling that i want to make it here
4283277 i havent had a chance to speak with arsene wenger but i have been training with the physio to improve my fitness levels
4283278 i dont know if we will sit down and talk next week or the next but the most important thing is for me to be back working with the team

4283355 we were pleased to see cargo and mail tonnage growth once again stay ahead of capacity growth though demand into and out of northeast asia remained weak

4283468 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
4283469 and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
4283470 the most selfish group of companies that ive ever seen and the most hypocritical
4283471 these oil companies cannot continue to earn these profits spend a pittance on renewable fuels to move america beyond oil and then block any efforts to shift billions in tax breaks to companies trying to bring about the next generation of clean energy
4283472 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second
4283473 well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4283474 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4283475 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
4283476 a liberal is someone who puts his foot down firmly on thin air
4283477 america was built by its radicals the hope and future of america lies with its radicals
4283478 this is the job for todays radical to fan the embers of hopelessness into a flame to fight
4283479 from militant indians to chicanos to puerto ricans to blacks from all parts of the black power spectrum from panthers to radical philosophers from a variety of campus activists s d s and others to a priest who was joining a revolutionary party in south america

4283486 a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
4283487 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4283488 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4283489 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4283490 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4283491 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4283492 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt

4283529 he had his bags packed and would have been getting ready to leave when he was killed
4283530 it was a savage beating he was struck numerous times to the head and face
4283531 im pretty scared he said mr goodchild pictured leaving the court with his dvo told the court he went out with her for four years
4283532 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4283533 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4283534 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4283535 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4283536 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4283537 the prime minister john howard had responded to the call of the indigenous women to come to the aid of them and their children
4283538 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children the defeat of the black man was absolute
4283539 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4283540 the main concern i have with what she is saying is that it actually gives a sense of no hope

4283590 the netherlands and belgium are more crowded than japan or taiwan but nobody says japan or taiwan will solve this race problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them
4283591 everybody says the final solution to this race problem is for every
4283592 what if i said there was this race problem and this race problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non blacks were brought into every black country and only into black countries
4283593 how long would it take anyone to realize im not talking about a race problem i am talking about the final solution to the black problem

4283599 eso de am rica latina nos lo impusieron cada d a yo hablo menos de hispanoam rica de latinoam rica indoam rica afroam rica eso es lo que somos nosotros
4283600 para m lo que impuso el nombre de am rica latina fue un fen meno eminentemente cultural
4283601 en hispanoam rica se afrancesaron mucho los procesos culturales los grandes artistas e intelectuales iban a par s a estudiar
4283602 hablar de indoam rica es un absurdo no podemos regresar a lo que no somos
4283603 lo primero es que somos un continente multirracial y policultural de ah que a lo largo de este libro no se emplee la denominaci n am rica latina inventada por los franceses en el siglo xix para incluirse en el conjunto americano sino la descripci n m s completa indo afro ibero am rica
4283604 pero en todo caso el componente indio y africano est presente impl cito
4283605 often ends up in landfills or incinerators instead of being recycled and that means toxic substances like lead cadmium and mercury that are commonly used in these products can contaminate the land water and air
4283606 items collected at free events are sometimes destined for salvage yards in developing nations where toxins spill into the water the air and the lungs of laborers paid a few dollars per day to extract materials
4283607 congrats you will be joining barack for his convention speech at invesco field you will receive an email tomorrow with info on how to pick up your credentials

4283609 is there any other reason why youre not taking this medication
4283610 yeah i can understand that but serious complications can arise if you dont do this
4283611 what is it thats going to make you realize that you need to take coumadin i say you need it your hemotologist says you need it what is it thats going to convince you
4283612 its not as though my blood hypercoagulates this has never happened before and its just a direct result of the abscess i dont see a reason
4283613 how about if we did another sonogram if its resolved then you dont have to take it if it isnt then you have to take it
4283614 well i say we try to put you back on humira
4283615 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4283616 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4283617 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4283618 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out

4283620 what you have to realize is that this is a marathon
4283621 i think john would do a town hall meeting that would last for days
4283622 john dont wear yourself out make sure your message resonates visually
4283623 class this is dane peterson hes transferred from week 24 topic
4283624 we were all schedu advertisement led to go and meet with the sadc organ on politics and defence were not going anymore
4283625 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4283626 the indian government should order troops and police to refrain from using lethal force against violent protesters in jammu and kashmir unless absolutely necessary to protect life
4283627 it is all a huge setback for a political solution to kashmir
4283628 the figure of 41 officially reported british rape victims so far is the worst ever in greek police records
4283629 at the present rate it is bound to break all previous records and will again give greece the unenviable record of having the largest number of british rape victims both in real figures but especially proportionately to the british tourism population
4283630 i am extremely pleased justice has finally been done for my men its been a long battle
4283631 i think all sides will know where to draw a line to prevent further escalation
4283632 clearly it could escalate if there are flashpoints if for example there is a stand off between ukrainian
4283633 its in nobodys interest for this to escalate to a regional conflict
4283634 what happened in georgia could directly impact on ukraine if for example the political divisions in ukraine solidify and become violent in any way what this could do is set a template for russian intervention in a sovereign state
4283635 a conflict is in neither russia nor ukraines interest trade between the two has been rising at 30 per cent a year the price moves today are understandable but not really justified
4283636 unfortunately the gas deal with the russians has not yet been signed and this could make it more difficult
4283637 a sudden adjustment to market prices for gas next year would be hard for the economy to absorb
4283638 its a perfect storm for ukraine at the moment the government has made it clear that it is on a collision course with russia and there are other issues as well
4283639 the idea that you get one of these flare ups in tensions that involve military conflict that would then just die down overnight was somewhat misplaced all you can really say is that well have a kind of focus on the more medium term issues and try to see through this bout of political risk
4283640 its certainly true that the longer this goes on the bigger hit russias image is going to take in the west but at the same time there is a change of administration in washington at the end of the year and there has been a change in moscow
4283641 although putins prime minister whether you like it or not we do have a more dovish president in place now whether hes pulling the strings or not
4283642 a significant uptick in fighting is on balance unlikely given president medvedevs 12 august statement that hostilities are almost complete and the 13 august informal ceasefire
4283643 the chance of an incident is very low as the risk to both sides is obviously extremely high but some danger is created by ambiguity in the terms of the ceasefire and by the chance that a separatist could try to trigger an incident
4283644 the production of grappa is part of northern italys social and cultural tradition and is carried out in the alpine regions by hundreds of families as it always has been
4283645 the aim of the bill is to bring home made grappa production out into the open and to outline a code of hygiene while safeguarding the business of authorised grappa producers
4283646 grappa production needs to adhere to strict health and safety standards you cannot allow just anyone to make it
4283647 there are rules and regulations there to protect the health of the drinker what guarantee is there that these will be followed if this bill is approved
4283648 this bill would put distilleries who make genuine grappa under threat serving home made grappa in an agriturismo is not like serving your own home produced wine or fresh produce
4283649 the advanced techniques of proper grappa distilling guarantee the safety and quality of the product who will provide the controls lets not forget that in the past our grandfathers and great grandfathers who brewed their own grappa died with their digestive organs on fire because it was badly made
4283650 this is a ridiculous idea and one that will potentially be very dangerous every year there are cases of people dying after drinking home made grappa the production of grappa must be properly controlled to ensure it is safe and to allow distilleries that make it legally and correctly to continue production
4283651 i want to make a chocolate chip so big that if it was 6 ft tall a person would be a millimeter
4283652 amber the thing is when youre nice youre one of the most loyal friendly selfless people around when youre not nice youre dangerous hurtful and unpredictable being around you kind of feels like russian roulette to me 5 6 times youre a great person to be around but that sixth of a time youre not its too much to handle and theres no way of knowing when a bullet is in the chamber or not
4283653 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do we know what messages will work and what will not
4283654 if dr king marched today would bill gates march i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped would he give me the answer probably not
4283655 dont take your organs to heaven heaven knows we need them here
4283656 i am natural i am predictable and i taste sooooooo good
4283657 while our position on admission has been very inconsistent during this eight year period we have consistently attempted to do what is legal
4283658 this is a very confusing and complicated issue were looking for some direction from the federal government and obviously were not getting any
4283659 as it stands now the open door policy has been in existence for quite some time and to change that we need to know where we stand for sure with the various government agencies
4283660 we think that children should not be punished for the fact that their parents came here from another country and they came along with them
4283661 they may be graduates of north carolina high schools and then we turn around and say that they cant attend community colleges we dont think thats fair
4283662 we could keep in place the policy we agreed on in may and send this whole discussion to the policy committee
4283663 i think the timing is impossible and for the life of me i dont understand why we have to do it today when the attorney generals office hasnt said we had to
4283664 we need to put it to bed once and for all and not be constantly coming back and forth on the issue
4283665 el presidente no ser acusado ni juzgado por ning n cargo
4283666 the diplopedia project hosted more than 4 400 substantive articles is edited by 1000 registered users and has had 650 000 page views

4283668 the early successes of a simple model created exactly the incentives attention the desire to see your work spread needed to create serious improvements

4283672 we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a de facto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4283673 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league twenty20 will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered
4283674 we are not punching bags and we wont be taking any backward steps
4283675 we showed against st george that if thats the way the game goes we will adapt to it
4283676 theyre a team you have to pressure and we have to get up in their faces but within the guidelines
4283677 we dont want to lose it like st george did
4283678 we havent had any problems with the referees no more or no less than any other club
4283679 its just a bit of an excuse to try and justify what theyre doing
4283680 but weve got brett white michael crocker jeff lima dallas johnson those guys arent going to take a backward step to anyone
4283681 like a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4283682 i think its disgusting and i dont think its proportionate
4283683 next time there is a police charge brought against someone from another club just have a look at the scale of the coverage
4283684 collingwood sells newspapers if its collingwood its a mad frenzy its like a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4283685 as proven anyone can beat anyone on a given day and thats the mindset that you have to have
4283686 does he do all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over to another coach in 2011 that would be grossly unfair
4283687 last year was messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4283688 ive spoken to eugene and ive spoken to james club chairman brayshaw this week but my main concern is winning games of footy
4283689 we have been training as if hes going to play if he plays theres a different complexion on things
4283690 you put mat rogers and prince there and all of a sudden they have points in them if he plays it will be massive for them
4283691 hes a visible player early obviously you can hide him in defence hes still going to have to make contact in attack
4283692 quarterbacks are hard to find hes a good one im not going to stress about it and neither are the players we havent watched any video of the gold coast
4283693 if prince plays they have all played against him before and they will know what to do
4283694 the difference with us is our physician has cleared him
4283695 i include myself in that group that sometimes doesnt get it
4283696 we dont know where hes from but i know for sure he isnt spanish
4283697 in juan antonio and maria elena you can tell that he wants to go beyond the clich s and find the soul of the people
4283698 this is one case where you can tell somebody wants to have fun with that and put people in a place where they want to go through that to something deeper
4283699 basically i think its good that people go ahead and work on different projects that put them in uncomfortable zones
4283700 i told him im a great actor see how i suffer for my work
4283701 he said that doesnt mean youre great it means youre stupid
4283702 este a o no hay casi mosquitos porque lo he curado todo con
4283703 oyes tu apaga la lus tu te has creido que somos ricos
4283704 amos petri si yo he engorgado que digo yo que si ser del agua este que bebemos
4283705 oyes ni a t tratanos bien como si fueramos la piti guoman que nos vamos a dejar aqu un dinero
4283706 i do not know what anything including this means and so i do not know how to respond to it and i will not use my own past learning as the light to guide me now
4283707 from hearing rons recent statements its obvious that he has an immense desire to win
4283708 we have a team of players who have that same immense desire and ron will fit right in
4283709 i do not ask for these only but also for those who will believe in me through their word
4283710 that they may all be one just as you father are in me and i in you that they may also be in us
4283711 so that the world may believe that you have sent me
4283712 so that the world may know that you sent me
4283713 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul
4283714 army specialist jay navas contributed 250 while deployed in iraq but it wasnt over the internet
4283715 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4283716 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage

4283728 q4 represented a strong finish to a very successful year
4283729 revenue exceeded our previously announced guidance due to strong led sales which grew 11 sequentially and 27 from a year ago we have executed our strategy to transform cree into a broad based led company with chips components and systems that are leading the led lighting revolution while we recognize that there is caution in the market about the global economic environment we remain optimistic about the year ahead as the momentum continues to build for our new products and energy efficient lighting

4283731 with the majority of advanced battery technology and manufacturing currently based in the far east we are convinced that next generation high performance batteries can be designed and produced here in the u s
4283732 a key part of our success to date comes from the strong support of leaders at the federal state county and city levels
4283733 were proud of this relationship their support and the resulting economic impact on the community
4283734 we have geared up resources and will have anti air attack systems in place in the capital some areas have been declared no fly zones
4283735 we appeal to people to observe august 15 as a black day and stay away from indian functions
4283736 in these parts the subprime crisis seems very remote and fears of an autumn recession dont exist
4283737 the most worrying things for the new owners are the rise in the number of jellyfish and an odd decision by the mayor of saint tropez to forbid overflights by helicopters
4283738 we are nice people and we get rewarded like this
4283739 i will close down everything i pay taxes this is my right
4283740 from north to south the rebellion against those who show off their money and power is growing
4283741 which has a lot to answer for being apparently the inspiration for milton keynes and modern traffic roundabouts
4283742 a wonderful painting and strangely the only italian masterpiece showing her in this expectant state
4283743 to end the war in the pacific and save lives
4283744 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped
4283745 everyone knows exactly what you have to do in every circumstance everyone tries to do it confident that everyone else is doing it and anyone who fails will be subjected to the justified scorn of everybody
4283746 scandinavian code of egalitarian conformity which absolutely forbids anyone to feel superior to their neighbours
4283747 it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
4283748 it was a minor news item when a barack obama aide fell off a chicago curb while texting on her blackberry evidently she is one of way too many people getting hurt as they text while doing something else at the same time
4283749 too bad im god i say youre busted so youre busted see ya later and dont let the flaming sword holding angel hit your ass on the way out
4283750 alphonso didnt even do anything he just kept shooting and missing 3s
4283751 it just shows that one player cant fix a team
4283752 rob is busy in another league but he will be back soon
4283753 they look small out there i heard theyre not that good
4283754 our team will finally win one today i mean look at these guys
4283755 we have a roster of 12 players and only 4 of them show up
4283756 if dynasty gets into a running game it will be over for the rock
4283757 if the rock finds a way to neutralize cruz and ngaraywongse theyll be okay
4283758 when it rains it pours comes to mind when i look back on my life
4283759 we would be helping them create a work that might well be beautiful but that does not conform to our views
4283760 the film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an individual and autobiographical novel like a confession or a diary the film of tomorrow will not be directed by civil servants of the camera but by artists for whom shooting a film constitutes a wonderful and thrilling adventure the film of tomorrow will resemble the person who made it and the number of spectators will be proportional to the number of friends the director has the film of tomorrow will be an act of love
4283761 and i was going to pull it out and use it if he kept coming and he kept coming
4283762 ewan had thrown a beer can at a mercedes we were very loud and out of order
4283763 everybody could see this little bearded fellow cross the street and whisper something that stopped us tearing lumps out of each other
4283764 mike told me to hang round the church steps and then an actor he didnt say who would turn up
4283765 when ewan came along i didnt recognise him it was before he was in trainspotting he was speaking in this impenetrable scottish accent he might have been an actor but he might have just been an annoying scotsman i just followed the motivation of the character
4283766 i was standing across the street ewan was wandering around shouting maggie maggie because archie was looking for his friend somebody leaned out of a window and told him to quiet down and he in character told them to fuck off
4283767 when the police arrived i went over and said im a director and were making a film the officer asked where the camera was i said we were improvising and he wasnt convinced so we had to take him back to our office and get others to corroborate the story
4283768 i always do if theres a chance of violence or if two characters are going to fuck
4283769 i thought that was another world not for the likes of me
4283770 the lifestyle i have now and the opportunities i have had are all down to mike getting me on board in naked
4283771 after cannes my agent told me to get the next flight to la he was right i had a part in prime suspect 3 by the end of the week
4283772 immersed to the hilt in a traumatised conception of the real the real london of homelessness violence sexual exploitation and despair
4283773 being trapped for two hours in a railway carriage with a charismatic preacher who might possibly have an axe under his coat
4283774 her husband mike and i thought was a nightclub bouncer so johnny has to clear out or get filled in
4283775 have you ever thought right that you have had the best moment in our life and all we have got to look forward to is sickness and purgatory
4283776 since he is at his worst a cold desperate fish his redeeming feature is that he still cares
4283777 johnnys an idealist certainly not a cynic which is how hes often portrayed
4283778 we had a very enlightened teacher who endlessly reminded us that the next total eclipse would be in august 1999 later i started thinking about the millennium and the end of the world in 1992 the millennium was impending so i brought that idea to the film
4283779 with vera drake i had long wanted to do a film about backstreet abortions before the 1967 act
4283780 what always happens is that ill get an actor to come along and ill say i cant tell you what the film is going to be about but we will collaborate on the creation of a character some actors run a mile
4283781 when we first met for naked mike asked me to list men id known or met and to tell him everything about them
4283782 i told him about 150 different people mike asked of each one does he drive when did his parents die how does he prefer to have sex and then you narrow the list down its like a beauty contest and by the end of it i was rooting for the guy we chose because i knew that i could do something with that role but i also remember thinking jesus not him because there was a lot of darkness there which i knew that for the next eight months would be my life
4283783 what you end up is not the person on whom the improvisation was based i knew that guy quite well but even mutual friends would find it hard to identify him from what they see on screen
4283784 i got dangerously close to the character i rather unfortunately got married a few months before to the actor and director sara sugarman which was a mistake it wasnt a good idea to work on naked in the first months of a marriage i was living apart from my wife in a flat overflowing with books i was reading for the part i read kerouac bertrand russell the bible the quran i remember finding out there was this plan to subcutaneously insert bar codes into our skin and i made a note thinking that would be a great thing for johnny to talk about in the film
4283785 im often asked what does johnny do hes a reader hes one of those kids teachers have turned away from because their intelligence is too unruly
4283786 short of masturbation hell watch you do anything later you improvise with other actors katrin and me or lesley

4283812 im just still kicking and im not putting any restrictions on myself it doesnt say i have to stop at a certain age
4283813 im not ruling anything out i still feel good and i still have that competitive fire in me
4283814 what ive probably done in a lot of areas is that ive tried too hard
4283815 i shoot great technique ive been told this not just by u s coaches but other international coaches its just somethings happening just a few times in a match that throws me out of some competitions thats a mental thing and you know the brain the mind is a terrible thing
4283816 you still have to have the same mental approach have to have the same techniques to execute the shot
4283817 there may be a different perspective in maybe somebody who is younger or hasnt been here before but thats just all part of experience just having general experience in life
4283818 throughout shooting you will find that some things work at a certain period of time and then after a while it doesnt work any more
4283819 im way more advanced than i was when i first started shooting
4283820 but its some mental things that really grab me at certain times and it hurts me in the match
4283821 some days youre really good some days youre really bad and some days youre mediocre
4283822 thats what makes shooting interesting and i guess challenging you can shoot a perfect score and the next day go out and you arent diddly squat

4283894 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch

4283896 the most bonkers invention here is the coffee cooler he said of the circa 1920 metal cylinder which would be plunged into a piping hot cup

4283907 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4283908 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4283909 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4283910 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4283915 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4283916 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4283917 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4283918 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4283919 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4283965 they iran are behind a lot of high profile attacks meant to undermine us will and british will such as the rocket attacks on basra palace and the green zone in baghdad

4283986 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
4283987 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
4283988 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
4283989 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

4284024 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4284025 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4284026 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4284027 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4284028 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4284029 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4284030 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4284031 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4284032 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4284033 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4284034 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4284035 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4284036 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4284037 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4284038 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4284039 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4284040 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4284041 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4284042 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4284043 weve heard the reports and we continue to monitor it
4284044 how can i wait if im in no position too
4284045 your condition is not that bad compared to others so you wait
4284046 she barely made it to the hospital and youre telling us theres a wait
4284047 theres a wait and i cant do anything for her right now
4284048 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain

4284051 homeland security officials caught sleeping 6 8 hours wasted daily
4284052 there are important reasons why a delegation of officials must attend the sixth annual asian pacific homeland security summit scheduled for oct
4284053 a considerable amount of this research is being pursued in pacific rim countries like singapore australia and japan she said
4284054 we will use any technology we can find that makes america safer
4284055 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4284056 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4284057 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing criminal investigations for many years
4284058 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4284059 they have multiple properties they take vacations in montenegro they travel to belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4284060 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4284061 mladic is probably the hardest target there is and i think bringing him to justice will be very difficult it could take a week it could take a month it could take a year
4284062 well it takes a courageous person to look for them
4284063 find promising leaders in politics international organizations as well as world class media in order to promote relations between overseas koreans and their mother country
4284064 sort through stephanies identity crisis and ensure her peace of mind
4284065 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4284066 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4284067 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4284068 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4284069 shell be fine she has her boyfriend she doesnt need me here
4284070 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4284071 deep concern over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir
4284072 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi
4284073 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4284074 if it doesnt work out like you hoped you can always come back home but it could be life changing and wonderful which youll never know unless you try
4284075 being married is not something thats even in our minds
4284076 whats important to me is to have a home that is peaceful and healthy
4284077 after 60 hours of labor im taking it one day at a time
4284078 ive been wearing one of the bags for more than a year
4284079 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4284080 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4284081 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4284082 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4284083 can assist has a number of branches across the state and our aim is to be a support for people with cancer in our community
4284084 our service is very much behind the scenes where people needing a bit of a hand during a difficult time are helped without fuss or fanfare
4284085 it might be something like helping a family meet everyday costs associated with cancer treatment such as travel accommodation and meals or help with medical costs well even look after everyday expenses like household bills
4284086 our group also raises money to support the jean colvin hospital an oasis in sydney for people from rural areas receiving cancer treatment away from home
4284087 we welcome new members at any time and some of the events planned include fielding a team in the nsw cancer councils relay for life in armidale from october 18 our annual melbourne cup day luncheon and a charity bowls day at uralla both in november
4284088 with a new council well be able to achieve a lot more consensus than the current council and that will be a way forward for armidale
4284089 if the community tells us they want something then we would be hard pressed to go against it
4284090 the party has given us a guarantee that we dont have to vote contrary to what we believe in so we will vote on issues
4284091 weve been privileged to have been members for so long and its nice to be informed of the things that are going on
4284092 the people of nsw would welcome a cash injection now more than ever and hard working new england residents are clearly dreaming of the sort of lifestyle they could have if financial constraints were removed
4284093 our pockets have felt the pinch due to the increased cost of living and our dreams and optimism has suffered as a result
4284094 i ask my clients to visualise what they would do if they won 1 million in lotto it helps to clarify their dreams and aspirations and also identify what might be holding them back from achieving what they want in life
4284095 new englanders are dreaming about a luxurious lifestyle where they have the freedom to purchase expensive items
4284096 it seems a lotto win would not only fund their enjoyable dreams and desires but allow them to spend that bit extra on friends family and worthwhile causes

4284101 this is the day that they lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it
4284102 large parts of the conflict affected area particularly south ossetia and the gori region remain for the most part inaccessible to humanitarian organizations due to ongoing insecurity lawlessness and other constraints
4284103 all sides to control forces under their command to ensure that the current state of lawlessness ceases
4284104 if they have any complaints please tell them to contact the russian ambassador or the russian mission
4284105 please tell them not to participate in a disinformation campaign but rather deal seriously with the matters they are supposed to deal with
4284106 reports of some continuing violence with civilians bearing the brunt
4284107 russia has no authority not moral and of course not legal to question what is in the goods
4284108 we think that this really can be a deterrent for the future escalation by the russian side in this conflict
4284109 i think it should be possible to have this resolution before too long
4284110 profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4284111 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4284112 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4284113 over the past 24 hours weve seen that the violence has died down
4284114 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4284115 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4284116 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4284117 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today

4284134 with los angeles foreclosure rate surging by nearly 300 percent city housing officials said wednesday that they hope to help stabilize the market soon with millions of dollars in federal funds that would let them buy and resell homes already or likely to become abandoned
4284135 mercedes marquez general manager of the los angeles housing department said the foreclosure crisis is the most serious she has seen in the housing industry with 9 100 foreclosures in the city over the past 18 months primarily in south los angeles and the san fernando valley and more than 35 000 homes in default
4284136 the first year it was primarily the subprime loans where we saw the most foreclosures marquez said
4284137 if there is a bright side she said it is that housing prices so greatly inflated during the boom years are now coming down and giving more middle income people access to the housing market
4284138 the prices were going so high that most people couldnt afford the homes they had marquez said
4284139 after a month on the market a new 145 unit condominium development in costa mesa has three residents living within its walls the pacifica development at the intersection of the 55 freeway and 19th street is not alone in costa mesa developers who had once expressed interest in building for sale units have been stopped in their tracks and many have shifted their focus to building rentals
4284140 we havent received any new applications for any major new condominium developments in at least six months said claire flynn the citys principal planner
4284141 city council members have unanimously held it as a top priority to get more people to buy in the city instead of renting but the effort has been largely unsuccessful and city officials blame the economy
4284142 not long ago the developer of the largest project that attempted to take advantage of the citys incentives for building for sale homes had to approach the council and ask the city to allow it to rent its 151 units
4284143 the developer nexus got the approval to build its project in part because it promised to sell the units but with the housing market in its present state the developer pleaded that it would be impossible to get financing
4284144 banks will lend money if nexus does apartments but if the city said you cant build apartments then that project never would have happened said fellow costa mesa developer bryan coggins
4284145 coggins owns dozens of rental properties in costa mesa mostly on victoria street he said the rents that he is able to charge have stayed stable and that even in some cases gone up while local for sale properties have depreciated by up to 30

4284150 homeowners are flooding city hall with so many requests to reduce their property values that the tax assessor said wednesday his office may not be able to meet the demands
4284151 the requests come as the number of home sales and housing prices continue to fall in many san francisco neighborhoods the citys median home sale price fell nearly 12 percent between may 2007 and may 2008 according to the city controller
4284152 san francisco homeowner emily flores said she and her family are strongly considering leaving the city after the outer sunset fixer upper home they bought in 2006 increased 90 000 in assessed value even though home values in the neighborhood dropped
4284153 flores whose husband provides the sole income for the family of five said their taxes are set to be 1 500 higher than what they paid in 2006
4284154 for us what were feeling now is if were going to pay almost all our monthly income for housing we want it to be in a location where property taxes are actually paying for something said flores 28
4284155 joshua carnes vp of operations for the sacramento based prop8 org said anyone who bought a home in the past few years should expect the assessed value of the property to decrease the company is named after proposition 8 the 1978 voter initiative that allowed home values to be reduced when there is a dip in market values

4284202 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was

4284206 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4284207 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game

4284262 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4284263 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4284264 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4284265 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time

4284328 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4284329 the steady drumbeat of double digit sales declines this year is beginning to weigh more heavily on prices
4284330 the provincial economy isnt exactly holding up too well so we certainly cant rule out a future price decrease in the toronto market
4284331 its not improbable since the trajectory is downward and the market is definitely past its prime
4284332 pricing power in full scale retreat across many major markets

4284356 i remember eating on wire tables for homecoming meals and meetings
4284357 we didnt have seats to sit on we just got our food moved around on those wire tables and did what we could with each other
4284358 were real thankful for what has been accomplished in these 105 years
4284359 we thought each year we move on that wed let it be made known here in dover where we are and what we stand for
4284360 itll be a treat to have him because he started right here
4284361 were having the church birthday party and were having a big cake in the fellowship hall too
4284362 i dont think a lot of the criticism is fair but the sec has not done as good a job in describing its role and what it was doing immediately prior to the collapse of bear stearns
4284363 the sec has not had a champion with the treasury and the chairman has chosen not to make his case for the agency loudly mr cox is a team player and doesnt want to be seen as at odds with the treasury but the people thinking up policy are naturally favourable to the fed
4284364 there is growing bifurcation between investor and consumer protection on the one hand and the safety and stability of markets on the other and we are at a watershed
4284365 the debate now is about whether the market stability function will go with the fed or with a new executive arm
4284366 one place it is not going to go is the sec frankly there has never been evidence that the sec has the tools or the culture to deal with market stability issues it has an enforcement culture with strengths in fraud company filings and disclosure rules
4284367 as the credit crunch has unfolded the sec has looked superfluous partly that is because of its remit but partly it is because of the natural hesitancy and reticence of christopher cox and his senior advisers about what is the proper role of governments in markets they believe in letting institutions shake out hank paulson us treasury secretary and mr bernanke have proven themselves survivalists who have been able to overcome their predilection towards market forces
4284368 the upper level winds are becoming more favorable for development
4284369 upper level winds are gradually becoming more conducive for development and this system could become a tropical depression today or friday as it moves over or just north of the northern leeward islands
4284370 as of early this morning the latest track model guidance consensus indicates that after the system tracks just north of the virgin islands and puerto rico on friday morning it should continue tracking west northwest and reach the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands on saturday night
4284371 by monday night the track model guidance consensus forecasts the system may be tracking either due north or north northeast and potentially be located about 200 miles east of cape canaveral
4284372 however you start getting into day four five six or seven and really the accuracy of any prognostication really starts to fall off
4284373 fairly bullish on ramping this system up over the next 5 days
4284374 that is one quality indicator and we looked at 32 indicators in all a 90 per cent target for drug treatment is a realistic target
4284375 a lot of the indicators were about quality of life rather than saving lives the quality of care was poorest in conditions associated with disability and frailty such as arthritis incontinence cataracts hearing problems and osteoporosis they are conditions in which an improvement in care can make a big difference
4284376 if it doesnt i think well still be ok since they have played together in years past if i had my choice id much rather have them do that
4284377 well see right now we are just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4284378 we have taken and made some direction there or at least have it going in the right direction there
4284379 im just trying to get him right we havent gotten that far yet
4284380 it looks like hes in good shape he told me he had been working out
4284381 we put him through some things here in the last couple of days so it looks like hes in pretty good shape
4284382 if i think that leg is getting fatigued or if he is giving an indicator that it is then well get him out of there i dont want to take any steps back there

4284384 collaboration with this young musician has been one of the happiest experiences of my life i say musician because although he possesses the technique necessary he possesses what is more important a soul
4284385 very impressive but you are the only one who could play these
4284386 playing knows no limits the technique is magnificent and unshakeable busoni must have played very like this
4284387 you have to play for the people you have to play for an audience you cant just go into the studio and make records you know
4284388 recording with them getting ready with them was the biggest thrill of my life
4284389 he had a fine tenor voice and at our get togethers he often sang lieder by schubert and brahms i would accompany him and he in turn would partner me in tournaments each of us felt he had the better deal
4284390 i dont understand why youre still single you can get any man you want
4284391 maybe hes really more shy around women than he acts around his friends

4284393 id just run out of steam i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not
4284394 i just couldnt get off the golf course fast enough
4284395 i was probably thinking of putting my clubs away for a week which is something i almost never do
4284396 the back nine was unbelievable he holed some fantastic putts and you have to do those things to win majors he has gone well beyond and he is one of the top players in the world hes just a great unbelievable pressure player under the crush he is just extremely good
4284397 i felt an edge in terms of my ability to take an opportunity when it comes around
4284398 but who knows last round of a major you dont know i keep approaching every shot hopeful it will click into place
4284399 i knew i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
4284400 and that was important i knew if i holed this i probably would win the pga
4284401 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major on sunday
4284402 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
4284403 hey with allt hat bad shit where is there room for any happiness

4284411 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4284412 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4284413 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4284414 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4284415 the sharp rise in bank repossessions combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale

4284422 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4284423 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4284424 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4284425 i dont remotely claim its a discovery of mine but i was genuinely shocked when i first saw it because i had never seen it in any academic biography of kafka the experts conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious
4284426 outrageous and extraordinary the holocaust happened after his death so its ridiculous to talk of his works in that light
4284427 we are devastated and furious but at the same time happy

4284430 as we get into the fourth quarter of this year many people will re set their it budgets for 2009 and we do not know what they will do if they do decide to set them lower then we will see some slowdown
4284431 i still remain of the view that europe as a whole will deliver low gdp growth zero 1 or 2 that sort of level and the it services business will grow at a few percentage points above that the big players like ourselves will do better than the smaller players
4284432 this is a solid statement from logica showing that the operational performance has remained strong despite the major changes as part of the strategic plan
4284433 we were talking a lot to customers about new customer relationship management crm systems and business intelligence systems and now they are asking how are we going to do some of the work we do today in morocco and india to get costs under control

4284450 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the ceasefire agreement to be honoured
4284451 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks
4284452 it reflects the socio economic problems and low aspirations in places like the north east its part of a wider social story there are many more independent and selective schools in the southern half of the country than in the north
4284453 for many independent schools their reason for being is to get their results up but its just the result of creaming off the best by definition if you cream off the best you will get different results
4284454 there were 75 000 more entries in the maintained sector getting as at a level
4284455 this makes it more important for universities to take into account contextual information about a student when they apply
4284456 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap in achievement between different areas of the country the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind in school
4284457 there is now a clear divide at the heart of our education system ministers must work to find the reasons for this inequality and ensure that any improvements in our schools and colleges benefit all students
4284458 we are doing well but we need to do better at ensuring that every school in every part of the country benefits from those improvements
4284459 i think we should celebrate standards improving just as we would celebrate any olympic medal

4284461 currently bhp has negligible exposure to platinum and may consider impala the worlds second largest producer of platinum group metals
4284462 however we feel that bhps bid for rio tinto may preoccupy the company for this year
4284463 on barclays credit market exposures we believe there is the potential for up to 4 6bn of further write downs these are spread across the whole credit portfolio but some may take longer to crystallise as they sit within the loan book we forecast 1 5 bn further write downs over the next 18 months as we believe exposures could move closer to other marks in the market

4284466 the new management team are still confident of recovery at rentokil but clearly the starting base looks to be lower than originally expected with the problems inherited from the previous management being compounded by a weakening economic background
4284467 autonomy should join the top companies club the ftse 100 from september 10 ahead of this we expect the company to maintain its usual heady pace of customer announcements with the share headed for ftse status and the resultant index buying that will incur we are upping our recommendation from hold to buy
4284468 the government is confident it is doing the right thing for the interests of ghana
4284469 by waiting until 2011 to start looking for tenants a year before we finish the project we will be further into the recovery and should get higher rates
4284470 57 000 square metres of the highest quality office space
4284471 today you would never start such a big project without a tenant already lined up the economics are not attractive enough
4284472 its already happening but in a less public way than with leadenhall street
4284473 by the first quarter of 2012 we hope it will be done and dusted
4284474 if the economy is to grow then employment needs to grow so we need to create more space for people to work
4284475 if we dont want to build on green fields then we need to get more people into the same space and that means taller buildings
4284476 this year has been more competitive we have fewer places available than we did last year
4284477 in the past for certain subjects we have been able to accept a limited number of near miss applicants
4284478 for selector universities not to use the new a grade would be perverse if they discount the a on the grounds that some pupils might be better prepared and will do better than others they might as well abandon the whole public examination system
4284479 i had to go down there for an interview and im glad i had the chance
4284480 on a course like mine you really need the chance to sell yourself and to prove your enthusiasm for the subject it was a very worthwhile process to be able to go to the university and do just that you can get the grades but thats just a piece of paper
4284481 shes an immensely talented and gifted young lady hard working everything a student should be a pleasure to teach
4284482 we cant take it for granted even in katarinas case but shes shown all the character and determination which i think theyll be looking for and shell get the chance to show that when she goes down there for interview
4284483 the situation we face is a situation of stagnation and steep slowdown
4284484 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months
4284485 but overall theres no reason for excessive pessimism based on the development of the first half of the year
4284486 there is a good chance the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4284487 net trade is still likely to make a small positive contribution to gdp growth this year and next
4284488 but this will be due to a weakening in import growth as the domestic economy weakens rather than a major strengthening in export growth and it will not be enough to prevent the uk from entering a recession and from activity slowing by even more than the bank of england expects
4284489 todays reports paint a similar picture sharp corrections in fixed investment and exports those having been the main engine of growth over the past few years and stagnating private consumption
4284490 students are being more canny about the subjects they do because they know that certain universities are now demanding more traditional combinations of subjects
4284491 in some ways thats unfortunate if they are being pressured to do subjects they might not be as interested in
4284492 the rise in numbers studying english shows that as ever its still the most popular subject in the curriculum its still a vibrant lively relevant subject despite being rooted in tradition
4284493 the drop might suggest that the examination system is still reasonably robust it should go some way to stemming criticisms that english is getting easier year on year it isnt the case
4284494 we are delighted that the trend is continuing students are increasingly aware that a levels in physics are seen by business and academia as the rolls royce of a levels and well worth all the effort when lining up for university places and the very best jobs but more still needs to be done to entice girls into the physics classroom
4284495 if the fsa adopted limits on speculation you would see the price of gasoline drop in the united kingdom
4284496 no large accumulation of evidence that speculation is playing a major role
4284497 we continue to believe the relief rally following barratts refinancing deal has been overdone and that we will see share price weakness in the lead up to the reporting season
4284498 we have thrown more money at that do we let go of the client or subsidise over the last two months we have decided to keep volume going i can either take a decision to say goodbye because this is a fast moving site or say what about splitting the difference its a new phenomenon
4284499 the government wants to expand social housing and is putting in money through the housing corporation

4284529 their message this morning has come out loud and clear they want to talk and ive said a number of times the door is open the phone is on lets have a discussion
4284530 for me its been encouraging that theyve understood the order of the court and they will abide by it until such time as we have a discussion which is important
4284531 there could be a range of things and that will probably unfold over the next week or so when we open some dialogue with them
4284532 im not sure where this will head but certainly its a different step for nrl clubs probably a different step for australian sport
4284533 i suppose its the first development that shows both sonny bill and toulon have recognised that any order of the supreme court is not something that you can take lightly
4284534 it is a serious piece of legislation and he should act accordingly which he has done and thats a pleasing sign
4284535 its also important in that it shows cant ignore it the injunction irrelevant of where you are in the world
4284536 so people who say that contracts arent worth the piece of paper theyre written on i think this sends a very clear message that if youve got a contract and breach it and the supreme court then has a look at that then youve got some ramifications
4284537 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment

4284548 their message this morning has come out loud and clear they want to talk and ive said a number of times the door is open the phone is on lets have a discussion
4284549 for me its been encouraging that theyve understood the order of the court and they will abide by it until such time as we have a discussion which is important
4284550 there could be a range of things and that will probably unfold over the next week or so when we open some dialogue with them
4284551 im not sure where this will head but certainly its a different step for nrl clubs probably a different step for australian sport
4284552 i suppose its the first development that shows both sonny bill and toulon have recognised that any order of the supreme court is not something that you can take lightly
4284553 it is a serious piece of legislation and he should act accordingly which he has done and thats a pleasing sign
4284554 its also important in that it shows cant ignore it the injunction irrelevant of where you are in the world
4284555 so people who say that contracts arent worth the piece of paper theyre written on i think this sends a very clear message that if youve got a contract and breach it and the supreme court then has a look at that then youve got some ramifications
4284556 we aim to prove that we can be responsible participants in the mining industry so that marathon can become a worthy contributor to australias economic development and social welfare
4284557 the arkaroola sanctuary should be off limits for exploration and mining
4284558 going to a blended mode you can still get that same performance almost the same or nearly identical environmental benefits but much decreased cost
4284559 we had the knowledge base from the ev1 we knew how to do electrically propelled vehicles
4284560 the ability to put this engine which is an off the shelf unit for all intents and purposes into the car to extend its range two three 400 miles its important
4284561 its probably the easiest way to integrate electric propulsion into peoples daily lives
4284562 were pretty confident with which chemistries work and which dont work
4284563 theres always value in being the leader but it cant be your primary driver

4284569 it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
4284570 that it was pointless trying to tell betty what to do
4284571 you buy pubs you paint them green greene king or you paint them red marstons and you then brew the cask beer and you lock everything else out thats very much the greene king model you buy all the pubs you can and you lock every other producer out
4284572 perhaps it is something the government ought to look at
4284573 i wasnt particularly keen on school and my father said get an offer to do something else and you can leave so i left school at 16 and went fishing for a year
4284574 my parents used to wave me goodbye with two pounds of bacon for the galley and id help crew the gravel barges taking the aggregate from southwold to other places the whole thing was run on a shoestring it was a bit like fred karnos army the barges were either sinking breaking adrift or crushing somebody elses boat it was a wonderful experience for somebody of 14 15 16
4284575 were not sitting here saying look at our wonderful old brewery my grandad used that it might have been wonderful 100 years ago but the worlds moved on and thats our whole mind set some regional brewers can be quite paternalistic traditional with things rooted in yesteryear and they very much pervade that im not knocking it thats their style but i think thats very much not our style here
4284576 in these difficult times there will be some of our shareholders who think short term gain is better but it is really about what the majority want for many years our ethos has been to run the company for the long term sustainable benefit of all stakeholders our strategy hasnt changed its only the pace that has its not an expansionist game today its a defensive game probably will be for the next two years
4284577 people dip in and dip out of them thats the problem theyre stag do material i dont think there are many blokes who would be happy to read zoo or nuts on public transport

4284580 and its probably something that kylie will never better cathy might though
4284581 its the ultimate pop record and its interesting that it gave kylie more respect than all her other attempts to make supposedly serious records dennis songs are ostensibly throwaway pop songs but theyre not theyre serious songs like toxic completely stick in your head
4284582 if it says cathy dennis in the credits to a song then people will always sit up and listen to it
4284583 i come from norwich pop stars dont come from norwich all my friends were farmers or children of farmers

4284587 ive been working for the last year and a half with a band i put together called sexcassettes were shooting a video for the first single killer love this month and i hope to have it out by the end of the year it has more of a band sound than produced pop as usual i have no idea what to expect

4284593 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4284594 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income

4284596 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts

4284605 we have done a lot of large events but this was the largest video based event that we have done
4284606 it was a phenomenally creative show and it was on a massive scale it had a lot of unique challenges we were pleased with how it turned out everyone here feels great about a job well done
4284607 the introduction of these new offences is the latest step to tackle bad driving where carelessness causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties

4284615 mouse skin is different from human skin but the research could help to explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer
4284616 extrapolation between the species for this aspect of biology is simply not warranted many agents that cause skin cancer in mice do not do so in man indeed some of these agents are used as therapies it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the results have any clinical relevance
4284617 if the theory that applying moisturisers increased the risk of non melanoma skin cancers were correct you would expect to see more of these cancers in women and on their faces
4284618 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so
4284619 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text is correct which is the main thing

4284630 its an extremely difficult job to begin with they absorb these children into their families children that are sometimes medically fragile they are mentally ill theyre developmentally delayed
4284631 what has happened is a small number of homes that have two children have billed the one child rate and then billed again for a one child rate instead of the correct two child rate
4284632 that rule has been in place and we really dont have a choice about following this rule

4284635 its not a bad thing to make a mistake it is a bad thing to make it twice
4284636 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated for or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
4284637 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4284638 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4284639 the high quality drug treatment that is being provided is the most effective way of reducing illegal drug misuse improving the physical and mental health of drug users as well as reducing the harm they cause to themselves and society
4284640 clearly too few people who misuse drugs are being identified and admitted to drug rehabilitation courses early on which has contributed to this worrying rise in admissions to hospitals
4284641 as drugs get stronger the harm they are doing to young peoples mental health is increasing the government needs to wake up to the scale of the problem
4284642 more than twice as many young men were admitted as young women which suggests men may be more likely to self medicate with illicit drugs to manage their emotional distress many of these admissions may be related to other pre existing mental health problems such as depression or feelings of alienation for which we need much earlier intervention and support when families and others express their concerns

4284649 i become obsessed with symbols such as wishbones or moths and study them for years then when a narrative has formed through preparatory prints drawings and research i infuse and twist the story with contemporary concerns

4284657 when you live in a small town in the middle of ontario it would have been too big of a dream to say that you want to go to hollywood but secretly i think i always knew when i was young i was a figure skater and every year there was an ice carnival i lived for the carnival thats when the actress in me first came out i loved the costumes and the sparkles one year i got to play marilyn monroe on ice i danced to diamonds are a girls best friend i wore a long blond wig and a red dress with sequins it was heavenly
4284658 i had a small town life i worked at the local mcdonalds for three years im not sure why they kept me i am something of a daydreamer and a dawdler so they would only let me be the friendly voice that greeted you when you entered the restaurant i was slow i would be organizing the sweet and sour packets in the customers takeout bag while the line snaked out the door even at a fast food restaurant i wanted everything just so

4284677 jumlah kematian yang mencapai 105 orang dalam rentang empat bulan membuktikan lemahnya koordinasi penyuluhan dan antisipasi dppkes terhadap penyakit tersebut di nabire dan paniai harusnya depkes dan kepala dinas kesehatan di papua bertanggung jawab untuk mengatasi klb ini secara terpadu sehingga mampu meredam jumlah korban yang meninggal
4284678 depkes harus segera menerjunkan tim kesehatan dalam jumlah optimal karena fasilitas dan tenaga kesehatan di sana masih sangat minim sehingga korban diare kolera dapat dengan mudah memperoleh pengobatan kesehatan ini juga harus dikoordinasikan dengan dinas kesehatan dan pemda setempat

4284764 if any soldier brings up issues about assaults or rapes we investigate each case thoroughly

4284769 they the soldiers are the vessels to get the supplies to the people they re eager to help out
4284770 would not be appropriate for a russian ship to join this operation at this moment in time
4284771 would have helped but its absence is not going to affect the carrying out of the mission
4284772 we re buying gas now at 4 19 per gallon in japan
4284773 and we re not going to get any relief until at least the first of october we can t sell for less than what we pay for it
4284774 the continued volatility of world fuel prices and the resulting impact on the defense logistics agency necessitates a fuel price increase in order to ensure the continued solvency of the defense wide working capital fund
4284775 we are still able to use the national u s department of energy average from the previous week to set the price over there since our wholesale cost is not as high as it is in japan and okinawa
4284776 they obviously do not have a 25 cent government of japan offset in korea
4284777 as soon as the plane did something that i knew link wasn t doing i said we gotta get out
4284778 we didn t have control of anything we were along for the ride
4284779 it felt like the plane was going to crash i remember looking at my hands and saying you ve got to be kidding me i put my head back closed my eyes and pulled as hard as i could
4284780 airplane was doing exactly what it was supposed to be doing
4284781 that s the crazy thing it was just a matter of bad data in bad data out i have so much faith in the b 2 as a plane that it hasn t thrown me off my game
4284782 it was a teary eyed moment for both of us
4284783 it s something that not many people in my career field ever get to experience when a plane goes down everybody usually dies you don t hear about a good ejection very often
4284784 gt died but i for one have been anticipating davids reaction

4284788 his smile was an outward showing of his whole friendly demeanor he wasn t a person who made enemies
4284789 personally i think the attack was planned but the only thing that popped in my head at the time was to get the injured soldiers off the site
4284790 georgia is a microcosm of a world of nations now emerging from old systems in that former preglobalized world the wests great powers were on top and everyone else muddled below what georgia represents is an independent nation that has worked hard to be part of the established civilized order rather than contribute to the chaotic and violent frictions that seem on the verge of constantly overwhelming the world putins russia is a manufacturer of frictions
4284791 you take me for a complete james blunt dont you
4284792 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4284793 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4284794 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the u s dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro

4284817 team it turned out that michael dell wasnt perfect at predicting the future
4284818 stocks go up and down and things may be different tomorrow but i thought it was worth a moment of reflection today
4284819 as we get into the fourth quarter of this year many people will re set their it budgets for 2009 and we do not know what they will do if they do decide to set them lower then we will see some slowdown
4284820 i still remain of the view that europe as a whole will deliver low gdp growth zero 1 or 2 that sort of level and the it services business will grow at a few percentage points above that the big players like ourselves will do better than the smaller players

4284828 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4284829 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4284830 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4284831 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time

4284839 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4284841 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4284842 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4284843 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4284848 are not in gori they have never been in gori they have never occupied gori
4284849 have begun providing relief supplies to tens of thousands of affected persons in those areas of the country that are accessible
4284850 however large parts of the conflict affected area particularly south ossetia and the gori region remain for the most part inaccessible to humanitarian organizations due to ongoing insecurity lawlessness and other constraints
4284851 safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas

4284853 what are fractures of the orbit when one or more bones surrounding the eye are broken the condition is called orbital fracture the orbit is the bony structure around the eye an orbital fracture usually occurs after some type of injury or a strike to the face depending on where the fracture is located it can be associated with severe eye injury and damage
4284854 yeah i dont know where all that came from right off the bat when i got caught with that right hand obviously something hit my eye but i think were going to be okay with it weve gone and talked to several doctors so everything is going to be okay i think
4284855 well its not that i fractured it i think its going to repair itself i think everythings going to be fine theres nothing the doctors can do the swellings already gone down a lot i heal quick im real fortunate in that regard
4284856 oh sure i mean you go into the fight and you start off right away blind so youre handicapping yourself right from the getgo thats never a good thing of course especially in this sport but we went out there and got caught early on and suffered the consequences from that and then just tried to push on through the rest of the fight unfortunately we werent able to mount the best of offenses at that point its a little bit difficult with only one eye youre favoring that side it was a lot more difficult task than i had first anticipated
4284857 i can only go out there and fight to the best of my ability and fight with what i got at that time its bad luck that night but i tried to stay out there and put on a good show and if hes going to do his antics afterwards thats up to him i guess
4284858 hes a pro wrestler thats what he does isnt it thats kind of his thing i think thats what people were kind of expecting i actually was kinda surprised pre fight that he wasnt talking a whole lotta trash but post fight ill be honest i really wasnt aware of everything that went on i was told afterwards guys are gonna do what theyre gonna do
4284859 like i said thats all on him i can only affect to what im able to do i went out there and made a mistake and got caught early and paid the price for it and tried to rectify it the best i could at the time
4284860 i dont know its not even been a week so the doctors were actually happy yesterday when i saw them i have to see them in another week to see how things are going i can see out of both eyes now fine im wearing contacts in them so everythings fine in that respect just trying to get the swelling down and hopefully everything will heal up good
4284861 i am getting a puppy this weekend and i have read your my smart puppy book and watched the video but i am not clear on how to teach the no command please help

4284864 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4284865 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4284866 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4284867 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4284874 hey we couldnt be happier for those los angeles dodgers who are selling about 30 000 tickets a day now that theyve moved their home games to planet manny but wed like to ask one little question of all those people in l a who are showering their man manny ramirez with so much love what the heck are you cheering for
4284875 for a man who decided his personal net worth was more important than an entire franchise and all the people who played with him covered for him depended on him sheez how sad is that
4284876 it really bothers me one gm said this week of the manny mania lovefest that has unfolded in l
4284877 it would in effect be an open invitation to every selfish superstar in baseball to pull a manny act up stop hustling stop trying refuse to play make up an injury whatever you have to do to get back out there on the free agent market its all worth it
4284878 we found ourselves in a conversation on this very subject the other day with an executive of a team that briefly kicked around ramirezs name before the deadline that team would have wanted him purely as a rental however because it was well aware it would have that other manny on its hands if it were to sign him beyond this year this team knew it couldnt possibly give this guy the deal hell want this winter because of that very precedent we just laid out for you
4284879 the dodgers of course havent experienced any of those problems yet oh they had a chuckle filled manny moment the other night when the ninth inning almost started without their left fielder joining in on the festivities but other than that the dodgers visit to planet manny has been one big happy carnival of line drives tough at bats and cha chinging cash registers but after what went on in boston last month what should we make of it when this manny shows up in southern california is this the real manny or is this just part of his new hit the lottery marketing campaign
4284880 my feeling is that it hasnt been a good year again
4284881 wind farms were a hot topic at the last symposium
4284882 in germany there are turbines above forests and the mortality rate of bats has been found to be high
4284883 in scotland it was thought to be less of a problem because turbines tend to be in wide open spaces where bats are less likely to be
4284884 one of the concerns is that the blades turn so fast the bats cant detect them and another is a change in pressure which it is believed to damage the bats internally
4284885 events are being held all over scotland and europe and the bat walks that are held are one of the most helpful things we can do
4284886 there have been people who have found a bat in trouble and able to get it help because a neighbour went on one of the walks and knew what to do

4285202 ive been pleased with the way weve progressed offensively we are throwing and catching the ball fairly well and senior quarterback john parker wilson is having a good camp so far his leadership has been a real positive so far in the development of our offensive team
4285203 i think the biggest thing with our young players is they need to be able stay focused on the process of what they need to do to be complete players at their position

4285214 i wanted everyone particularly people who usually dont play computer games to be able to play and enjoy knytt thats why i didnt make it very hard many gamers who play a lot naturally didnt like that but to me the game is all about the atmosphere rather than the gameplay

4285216 every effort was made to replicate the ground breaking work done by steve johnsons fx team on sil sils physiology was a combination of translucent and opaque elements which made painting the piece somewhat challenging we wanted to try and replicate the look of sil as close as we could to what was seen on the big screen with the use of separate clear cast outer torso face and opaque components as our foundation for paint we were able to really capture the depth of the characters look the inner skull as well as inner torso were fully painted using multiple layers of translucent paint adding depth and texture the clear cast parts were tinted with various shades of translucent color not only on the outer surface but on the inner surface as well even though the inner structures of sil are not fully visible they were still fully rendered in sculpt as well as paint once assembled the combination of paint clear elements and ambient light make for a dynamic collectible

4285254 i think hell is being in the absence of purpose
4285255 when i had no purpose no direction i actually felt like i was living in hell
4285256 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
4285257 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
4285258 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
4285259 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed
4285260 they believe everyone has an equal chance at this life and the next

4285264 james blake through to the semifinals the biggest win of his career so far
4285265 over a lifetime i think she can look back at this and be really proud
4285266 hes going to have a race in the 100 fly
4285267 hes got one of the best dolphin kicks in the world
4285268 hes got one of the most patient tireless and enduring strokes that youll ever want to see
4285269 he comes up with the 2 biggest blocks of his career
4285270 you have to give the german team credit even with a 3 1 lead they are still trying to score
4285271 the shape of the game has been changed by an umpires decision at the start of the first half and it needs to be addressed
4285272 this is not a team that has just picked up this sport a few years ago historically the netherlands has been very competitive
4285273 you can tell with that reaction that had to feel good
4285274 laporta picks a great time to get his first olympic hit
4285275 that one came out of his hand like a wet bar of soap
4285276 whos to say that the referees didnt get together before the game and say that there was going to be a lot of emotion in this game and they didnt want things to get out of hand
4285277 one thing you the u s team have to recognize is that you will not be refereed like a star over here
4285278 hes a tremendously skilled big man the big problem has been his weight he has always battled weight problems but he is a very difficult match up when he is ready to play
4285279 you can feel the crowd strongly behind the united states which as weve talked throughout these games just the opposite in athens where pretty much the crowd was rooting against them
4285280 very very unselfish play thats been the trademark of this team
4285281 the first real test in these games for the united states and it has been a tough one thus far
4285282 this is a team that is going to be proud of what they did but there is not going to be a lot of celebration they are going to start getting themselves prepared to see spain
4285283 its just one test of many to come for the u s a
4285284 for confidence purposes he blake has to get out early and stay with federer
4285285 the tennis hasnt been spectacular yet but i get the feeling we are going to have some drama as we go on
4285286 a bit of a surprise here with blake up although it is not as big of a surprise as it would have been a year ago
4285287 the rest of the tour suddenly thinks they can beat him and why not with his play in this match
4285288 the level seems to be picking up as soon as federer picks up his so does blake
4285289 look at the body language on federer he is almost slumped all the way over
4285290 james blake through to the semifinals the biggest win of his career so far
4285291 what a disappointment for roger federer on so many levels
4285292 we talk a lot about sportsmanship and rightfully so here at the olympics but the opposite was taken by a swedish medal hopeful named ara abrahamian in the 8kg division
4285293 abrahamian threw a tantrum at the podium and then did the unthinkable when he was awarded the bronze medal take a look at this the bronze medal being awarded something is whispered and he immediately leaves the podium throws the bronze medal on the floor and walks off
4285294 it did in a way spoil the victory ceremony for me certainly one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4285295 he plays so hard he gets himself in foul trouble a lot of times you cant get the value of him being out on the floor because hes not going to back down hes the kind of guy that will stand there and take a hit or give a hit
4285296 im very much aware that somebody can come out and beat me no matter how big a favourite i am at the olympics
4285297 i am ready to beat all my opponents including the unbeatable vlasic

4285312 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4285313 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4285314 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4285315 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4285316 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4285317 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4285318 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
4285319 no one wants to admit it but we are in a recession
4285320 its a crisis not only in the private sector in the public sector
4285321 im just being forthright about what kind of situation were in in preparing communities preparing people overall that this is a bad time and we have to take measure that are not going to be easy
4285322 if its a massive layoff if they lay off over 1 000 people the folks that are going to get hurt the worst are going to be the citizens of the city of chicago

4285330 we dont believe that were in a position where we have to change our message to the street
4285331 oh so thats how you do that sign in before you can post messages
4285332 dear friends this is now my second letter to you i have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking i want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our lord and savior through your apostles
4285333 where is this coming he promised ever since our fathers died everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation
4285334 but do not forget this one thing dear friends with the lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance but the day of the lord will come like a thief the heavens will disappear with a roar the elements will be destroyed by fire and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare
4285335 at that time the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn
4285336 now learn this lesson from the fig tree as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near even so when you see all these things you know that it is near right at the door i tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away
4285337 biblical prophecy provides some of the greatest encouragement and hope available to us today just as the old testament is saturated with prophecies concerning christs first advent so both testaments are filled with references to the second coming of christ one scholar has estimated that there are 1 845 references to christs second coming in the old testament where 17 books give it prominence in the 260 chapters of the new testament there are 318 references to the second advent of christ an amazing 1 out of every 30 verses twenty three of the 27 new testament books refer to this great event for every prophecy in the bible concerning christs first advent there are 8 which look forward to his second
4285338 since everything will be destroyed in this way what kind of people ought you to be you ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming that day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire and the elements will melt in the heat but in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth the home of righteousness
4285339 you ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming
4285340 since then you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god
4285341 therefore prepare your minds for action be self controlled set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when jesus christ is revealed
4285342 a personal attitude towards god that results in actions that are pleasing to god
4285343 and whatever you do whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him
4285344 that day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire and the elements will melt in the heat but in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth the home of righteousness
4285345 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testifies to everything he saw that is the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it because the time is near
4285346 i saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse whose rider is called faithful and true
4285347 come gather together for the great supper of god so that you may eat the flesh of kings generals and mighty men of horses and their riders and the flesh of all people free and slave small and great
4285348 now the dwelling of god is with men and he will live with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away
4285349 write this down for these words are trustworthy and true
4285350 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end to him who is thirsty i will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life he who overcomes will inherit all this and i will be his god and he will be my son but the cowardly the unbelieving the vile the murderers the sexually immoral those who practice magic arts the idolaters and all liars their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur this is the second death
4285351 i did not see a temple in the city because the lord god almighty and the lamb are its temple
4285352 these words are trustworthy and true the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place
4285353 behold i am coming soon blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book
4285354 so then dear friends since you are looking forward to this make every effort to be found spotless blameless and at peace with him
4285355 since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god
4285356 bear in mind that our lords patience means salvation remember verse 9 just as our dear brother paul also wrote you with the wisdom that god gave him he writes the same way in all his letters speaking in them of these matters his letters contain some things that are hard to understand which ignorant and unstable people distort as they do the other scriptures to their own destruction
4285357 therefore dear friends since you already know this that false teachers will come be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position
4285358 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen
4285359 grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
4285360 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men
4285361 we want to nip this in the bud by exempting the third bag
4285362 if you have young soldier with a family and the airline says you cant get on board if you dont have 100 upfront theyre going to war they have a lot more worries then trying to remember to get reimbursed
4285363 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
4285364 strongly backs a womans decision to carry a pregnancy to term the compromise language is the result of behind the scenes negotiations with abortion rights groups and religious leaders on both sides of the issue
4285365 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4285366 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4285367 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4285368 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4285369 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4285370 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4285371 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4285372 build medical units for 10 000 sick or mentally ill inmates
4285373 violating their the inmates constitutional rights because the care is so poor
4285374 do you really think this is all nice and tidy here ya go heres my confession thank you for shopping with us today i dont like this timbo
4285375 his face has been well we wont know who he is until we can get some dental records
4285376 tim check his mouth i bet those arent his real teeth
4285377 it may take awhile but we will be able to find out where these came from
4285378 something does not add up i highly doubt he would have cut himself up this bad before killing himself
4285379 hey kai this guy has a tan line where a wedding ring was
4285380 umm this may sound strange but the ups guy just brought a package addressed to you at this address we are holding him for questioning
4285381 tim get the fingerprint lifting kit and your camera ready
4285382 dont you think we outta wait for the bomb crew
4285383 take the driver and this journal back to the stations get the journals checked out for prints or any other clues get this guy questioned on every detail of this package go to the sorting station and track down where this came from you
4285384 you figure out who this house belongs to and where the kids are
4285385 would have to be priced based on the date of the actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge
4285386 advised mr jobs that the board would have to confirm its prior approval in a legally satisfactory method
4285387 fred relied on these statements by mr jobs and from them concluded the grant was being properly handled
4285388 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4285389 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4285390 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4285391 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4285392 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4285393 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real
4285394 no senator with all due respect back at you global warming is not real
4285395 suppose im wrong and theres no such thing as climate change all weve done is give our kids a cleaner planet but suppose im right and we do nothing then what kind of planet do we hand off to our kids and our grandkids
4285396 the choice america will face in november is very clear
4285397 long held conservative principles of limited government strong national defense and individual freedom
4285398 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4285399 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4285400 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4285401 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4285402 i rarely read newspapers because i find todays world so depressing
4285403 the pace of life today is so hectic and i think there is so much pressure on women to be like men it is all wrong
4285404 cada um fecha os olhos e apanha uma folha no bamburral
4285405 agora cada um verte gua dentro da lata com as folhas
4285406 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4285407 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4285408 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4285409 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4285410 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4285411 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4285412 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4285413 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4285414 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4285415 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4285416 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4285417 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4285418 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4285419 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4285420 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4285421 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4285422 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4285423 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4285424 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4285425 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4285426 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4285427 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4285428 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4285429 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4285430 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4285431 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4285432 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4285433 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4285434 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4285435 as much as i can make the satire meta there are elements of simplicity that make him more relatable and ultimately humorous at the end of the day its a 90 second clip and i just want people to laugh
4285436 as much as the first couple were simple digs on the culture you will see more layers as the series progresses such as breaks in the facade of the character and the fourth wall itself i mean hipsters cant call themselves hipsters but a lot of this is poking fun at myself
4285437 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4285438 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4285439 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4285440 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4285441 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4285442 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4285443 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4285444 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4285445 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4285446 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4285447 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4285448 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4285449 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4285450 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4285451 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4285452 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4285453 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4285454 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4285455 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4285456 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4285457 bring together industry leaders artists and academics to discuss a range of topics surrounding virtual worlds
4285458 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4285459 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4285460 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4285461 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4285462 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4285463 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4285464 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4285465 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4285466 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4285467 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4285468 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4285469 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4285470 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4285471 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4285472 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4285473 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4285474 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4285475 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4285476 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4285477 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4285478 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4285479 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4285480 in the fast fuel episode ludacris and lees biodiesel tour buses are running on empty in the middle of the texas panhandle
4285481 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4285482 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4285483 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4285484 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4285485 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4285486 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4285487 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4285488 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it
4285489 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4285490 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4285491 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4285492 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4285493 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4285494 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4285495 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4285496 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4285497 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4285498 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4285499 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4285500 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4285501 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4285502 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4285503 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4285504 game designer pixel artist painter tools designer product manager and marketing guy deep in the forests of the north west
4285505 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4285506 yes i am saying and it is true that georgia had the legal and morally justifiable right to use force and launch attacks to preserve their union
4285507 seems like president bush has more on the ball environmentally speaking than al gore does
4285508 and that is why democrats cannot seem to connect with joe q public
4285509 in the here and now in the eyes of joe q public the gop is better suited to lead
4285510 the fear mongering human caused global warming hysterics would have everyone believe that any global warming is bad they conveniently ignore all the actual benefits that a little warming would bring
4285511 and yet if edwards was a republican the left blogosphere would be all over it like white on rice
4285512 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4285513 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4285514 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4285515 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4285516 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4285517 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4285518 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4285519 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4285520 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4285521 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4285522 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4285523 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4285524 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4285525 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4285526 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4285527 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4285528 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4285529 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4285530 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4285531 had a little time on my hands this morning and scanned some right wing blogs
4285532 the consensus on the right fringe seems the be that barack obama is some kind of leftist huh can think of two explanations for this lack of fact based thinking
4285533 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
4285534 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
4285535 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
4285536 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
4285537 tabula digitas educational video games have been embraced by some of the most respected thought leaders in k 12 education
4285538 this tremendous acceptance coupled with positive reviews from all corners of the market has been both flattering and suggests that we will be successful in transforming the way children learn and their level of engagement
4285539 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4285540 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4285541 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4285542 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4285543 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4285544 just so you all know we did set a record
4285545 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4285546 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4285547 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4285548 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4285549 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4285550 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4285551 i believe that america did the right thing by not joining the kyoto treaty
4285552 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4285553 the leading private human pharmaceutical development company in the world
4285554 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4285555 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4285556 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4285557 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4285558 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4285559 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4285560 who will be the next president of the united states
4285561 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4285562 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4285563 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4285564 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4285565 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4285566 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4285567 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4285568 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4285569 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4285570 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4285571 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4285572 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4285573 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4285574 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4285575 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4285576 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4285577 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4285578 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4285579 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4285580 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4285581 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4285582 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4285583 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4285584 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4285585 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4285586 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4285587 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4285588 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4285589 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4285590 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4285591 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4285592 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
4285593 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4285594 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4285595 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4285596 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4285597 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4285598 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4285599 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4285600 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4285601 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4285602 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4285603 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
4285604 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4285605 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
4285606 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
4285607 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
4285608 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
4285609 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
4285610 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4285611 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4285612 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4285613 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4285614 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4285615 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4285616 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4285617 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4285618 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4285619 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4285620 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4285621 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4285622 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4285623 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4285624 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4285625 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4285626 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4285627 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4285628 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4285629 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4285630 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4285631 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4285632 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4285633 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4285634 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4285635 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4285636 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4285637 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4285638 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4285639 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4285640 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4285641 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4285642 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4285643 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4285644 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4285645 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4285646 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4285647 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4285648 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4285649 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4285650 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4285651 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4285652 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4285653 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4285654 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4285655 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4285656 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4285657 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4285658 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4285659 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4285660 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4285661 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4285662 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4285663 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4285664 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4285665 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4285666 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4285667 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4285668 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4285669 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4285670 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4285671 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4285672 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4285673 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4285674 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4285675 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4285676 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4285677 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4285678 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4285679 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4285680 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4285681 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4285682 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4285683 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4285684 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4285685 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4285686 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4285687 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4285688 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4285689 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4285690 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4285691 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4285692 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4285693 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4285694 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4285695 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4285696 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4285697 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4285698 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4285701 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4285702 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4285703 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground

4285706 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4285707 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4285708 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4285709 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4285710 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4285711 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4285712 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4285713 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4285714 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4285715 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4285716 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4285717 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4285718 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4285719 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4285720 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4285721 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4285722 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4285723 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4285724 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4285725 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4285726 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4285727 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4285728 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4285732 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4285733 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4285734 a disturbing thing with younger nurses is that because of the workload and just other nurses being too busy to do actual mentoring we are seeing high rates of nurses just saying after a couple of years i cant deal with this so they leave the profession altogether
4285735 its a real concern because when youre looking at an aging workforce you want to have nurses that are going to be in the system to replace the nurses that are retiring
4285736 and if theyre not there to replace them then whos going to get nursing care
4285737 were definitely aware the nursing environment these days is not ideal because its such an acute complex working arena so it does make for definite challenges

4285751 digital imaging for mammography at least when were looking at quality is at least as good
4285752 in some cases when we look at patients younger patients with very glandular or very dense breasts and peri menopausal or pre menopausal women that study did conclude digital mammography was the best choice
4285753 we are trying to minimize that impact by continuing to bring in locum support as we have for the last year for mammography
4285754 once we move to digital mammography then we can look at how we can transmit those images off island for further support there as well

4285779 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4285780 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4285781 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4285782 id rather be hated for who i am than loved for who im not
4285783 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4285784 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4285785 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4285786 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4285787 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4285788 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4285789 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4285790 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4285791 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4285792 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4285793 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4285794 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4285795 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4285796 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4285797 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4285798 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4285799 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4285800 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4285801 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4285802 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4285803 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4285804 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4285805 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4285806 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4285807 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4285808 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4285809 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4285810 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4285811 lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4285812 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4285813 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4285814 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4285815 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4285816 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4285817 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4285818 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4285819 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4285820 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4285821 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4285822 projects clicking on the button makes the preloader show up but its at 0 0 of the stage and not within my button anymore i tried setting the preloader back to default on the projects page which is the reason for question 1
4285823 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4285824 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4285825 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4285826 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4285827 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4285828 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4285829 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4285830 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4285831 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4285832 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4285833 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4285834 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4285835 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4285836 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4285837 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4285838 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4285839 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4285840 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4285841 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4285842 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4285843 who are open to doing something on the production side
4285844 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4285845 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4285846 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4285847 both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4285848 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4285849 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4285850 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4285851 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4285852 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4285853 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4285854 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4285855 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4285856 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4285857 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4285858 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4285859 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4285860 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4285861 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4285862 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4285863 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4285864 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4285865 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4285866 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4285867 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4285868 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4285869 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4285870 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4285871 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4285872 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4285873 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4285874 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4285875 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4285876 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4285877 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4285878 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
4285879 boot thing for the next 10 weeks with no weight baring
4285880 its possible that they are being sold to either nautical novelty shops or scrap metal yards
4285881 it can be compared to someone stealing the traffic lights on a busy main street
4285882 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4285883 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4285884 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4285885 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4285886 while people are paying 3 75 a gallon for gas
4285887 what you have to realize is that this is a marathon
4285888 i think john would do a town hall meeting that would last for days
4285889 john dont wear yourself out make sure your message resonates visually
4285890 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4285891 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4285892 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4285893 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4285894 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4285895 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4285896 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4285897 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4285898 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4285899 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4285900 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4285901 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4285902 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4285903 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4285904 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4285905 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4285906 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4285907 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4285908 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4285909 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4285910 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4285911 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4285912 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4285913 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states

4285936 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4285937 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4285938 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4285944 you mean exposing information about your operations for free without a prior requirement from a customer
4285945 it shows that bar audiences are in tune with the newest music trends and styles but still enjoy the classics
4285946 is the only comment that the museum is making on this matter
4285947 when people found the guys facebook profile and implored everyone to harass him there and when people charted the vacation schedules of the guys bosses
4285948 ive actually got a bunch more of what im calling renegade photography i believe that as a non profit for the general publics artistic enlightenment that the sf moma should have a more tolerant photography policy and i believe that renegade photography is a good thing and will create a more vibrant and beautiful world for us all to share in
4285949 several times i was asked not to photograph and id comply when asked only to whip out the camera and begin shooting again in the next gallery
4285950 after purchasing my family membership and visiting the museum today i was forcibly thrown out of the museum by two museum security guards at the direction of the director of visitor relations simon blint
4285951 he accused me of using a telephoto lens to spy on his staff from the public staircase on the second floor
4285952 was sitting directly below where he was taking pictures and that she felt uncomfortable especially when other visitors of the museum notice
4285953 he was repeatedly asked to stop taking pictures of her at least 10 that i counted and was then walked out by my co worker and i we didnt even touch him
4285954 i offered to show my photographs to blint and he refused to examine them
4285955 a simple review of my photographs which i offered would have easily cleared up any confusion i was not provided this opportunity as i requested i was simply ejected from the museum
4285956 i told him he was going to look foolish when i published the photo that i was taking and gave him every opportunity to take a more rational approach to the situation
4285957 mr blint was acting out while the bosses where gone
4285958 i just wrote him a nice little note looks like you fd with the wrong guest
4285959 wow hes going to feel like crap the next time he googles himself
4285960 i probably wouldve snapped a picture of him just to piss him off but thats how i roll
4285961 because of 9 11 everybody was afraid of people taking pictures of their buildings especially in the financial district
4285962 you should approach the person and tell him that youre not allowed to take pictures of the building can you please stop and thats exactly what i did about three times at least before he started going off on me
4285963 we all learned a lot of lessons after 9 11 and one of the ways you keep it safer is to try to discourage people taking pictures of the security installations that youve made to make it safer
4285964 theres still a very big fear today that people come around and snap pictures of buildings that have been securitized
4285965 you cant stop people from taking pictures of a building
4285966 if there was no trespass i dont see anything involved in taking the picture
4285967 he was not taking pictures of the building he was taking pictures of me
4285968 increasingly we are living in a world where photographers are routinely harassed again and again by authority figures overstepping their authority
4285969 while the photography steals your soul superstition seems to be long gone a whole litany of replacements have taken its place ive seen people branded as pedophiles for shooting at public parks or their neighborhood swimming pool ive seen people claiming 9 11 makes checking photography necessary
4285970 i asked him not to and then he started talking smack to me
4285971 i knew i couldnt leave the premises of the building so i got real angry i just felt like a dog on a leash
4285972 i know that i was not supposed to do it
4285973 it was wrong on my side but i was kind of provoked in doing that
4285974 i was out of a job after that for almost a year i did part time jobs but i wasnt able to get a full time job at the time plus i had a lot of studying to do
4285975 because after reading the blog i understood that everyone that blogged was against me there was not one word defending or saying something hey maybe hes not right maybe this guys defending himself there were at least two or three other cases where this or maybe some other photographers were taking pictures of security guards on purpose and making fun of them
4285976 the security industry is not the best job if theres others these other people try to make you look bad i dont think its right
4285977 by the way i later ended up with an apology from building management over that issue
4285978 if youre not on our property you can snap photos
4285979 i was overwhelmed with stuff going on in my own life school trying to pay my bills the usual stuff i dont have family here who help me out with money or anything else
4285980 the rule is there has to be an expectation of privacy was there a reasonable expectation of privacy and was the conduct basically outrageous but with respect to somebody in the business world thats not applicable
4285981 it does not appear that there is any legal claim
4285982 it sounds like they both could use some schooling in etiquette
4285983 o ne possible reason people are jumpy is the way that photographs routinely wind up widely circulated online
4285984 i wont be surprised if within a year or two no video no photography signs are much more prevalent which is sad because a few of the jerks may ruin it for everyone who can photograph responsibly
4285985 as a nikon d80 dslr user i find so many people consider a pro looking camera a threat while the point and shooters have no problems usually getting their cameras into concerts for example or shooting people out on the street
4285986 there is a law in california that prohibits the taking of pictures with the use of a telephoto lens if someone is engaged in some personal or family type activity but you could use a regular lens
4285987 my wife and i were taking a few photographs in the lobby when we were approached by hotel security who informed me that taking photographs in the hotel was not allowed
4285988 i argued with him a bit and told him that i was only taking pictures of bamboo he still pressed on with his no photography policy i finally got him to relent that if my wife were in the photo that i could still take the photo as soon as he went the other way i started taking pictures again illegal renegade photography
4285989 i read the blog and certainly we apologize for what seems to be the overassertiveness of the security person
4285990 but ive spoken with the director of security at the hotel and hes going to be conducting some sensitivity training in making sure his staff recognize the difference between recreational and professional photographers
4285991 my company is a big institutional donor to sf moma and im going to recommend they reconsider
4285992 you are trying to carve out special rights for yourself
4285993 because you feel entitled to do whatever you want whenever you want to do it
4285994 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
4285995 we believe the vehicle is both aesthetically pleasing and extremely efficient
4285996 by minimizing aero drag we can maximize the range of the battery
4285997 so it shouldnt come as any surprise that my exterior design team spent countless hours in the wind tunnel with our aerodynamicist to refine the volts exterior we believe this was time well spent when youre trying to extend gas free driving of the vehicle youll take all the efficiency you can get
4285998 we can say that human activities really screwed up oxygen conditions in our coastal areas
4285999 the next big challenge after global warming is going to be addressing the massive upset of the worlds nitrogen cycle
4286000 dengar dan camkanlah bukan yang masuk ke dalam mulut yang menajiskan orang melainkan yang keluar dari mulut itulah yang menajiskan orang
4286001 apapun dari luar yang masuk ke dalam seseorang tidak dapat menajiskannya tetapi apa yang keluar dari seseorang itulah yang menajiskannya
4286002 pain is good it lets you know your still alive
4286003 l alega que uno de los requerimientos era que saldara la deuda que tiene en asume administraci n para el sustento de menores y que cometi el crimen para poder entrar a la academia
4286004 yo habl con el examinador que estaba viendo su caso y me dijo que estaba pendiente a someter unos documentos
4286005 la segunda vez que fueron a ver la propiedad el jueves 7 de agosto le sacaron una pistola lo amarraron con duct tape cinta adhesiva y lo amenazaron con que lo iban a picar en cantos
4286006 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4286007 he didnt have a lot of experience in running a presidential campaign did he but he seems to know how to organize the task
4286008 though it lacks the glamour of more popular sites like myspace and facebook is the place to be
4286009 linkedin has more than 25 million members and it is adding new ones at the rate of 1 2 million a month or about one new networker every two seconds
4286010 honey i havent been drinking wine my aunt knows i hate the stuff this is grape juice
4286011 well i think someone slipped you something because you keep introducing me to the same people over and over again thats the third time youve introduced me to that blonde
4286012 i introduced you to a set of identical triplets and the guys are two sets of identical twins the clue should have been when i gave their names didnt you notice they each had different names
4286013 ive never been able to tell them apart right away and i grew up with them thats why they wear the name plates and bracelets to make it easier for the rest of the family
4286014 of course we used to take them off all the time and drive everyone crazy especially in high school we used to switch up classes all the time
4286015 hey youre wife wasnt so innocent either she was just as bad she and maria used to switch classes up in high school too maggie even took marias regent exams for her
4286016 yeah man its some freaky shit you know like the patty duke show the identical cousin thing
4286017 no were not its just people never bother to look closely at us my eyes are dark her eyes are light brown like mias
4286018 yeah but still you used to get away with switching up people used to think you guys were twins all the time
4286019 i visited her last year mags you guys still look alike except she has really short hair
4286020 how long have they been room mates like 15 years now
4286021 oh yeah i forgot she went all gay on us shes a dyke now right
4286022 shhh titi doesnt know shes gay she hasnt told the aunts yet
4286023 a good part is that they have not scored that many goals against us and secondly the more minutes we have together with this team the better it is
4286024 i guess this is about my home burning i guess this is about me stabbing and burning my wife
4286025 the law presumes that he is competent but well see if his attorney feels that he should be evaluated
4286026 the requested resource is not available when i try to launch the admin console form netbeans
4286027 im not sure if well pull the trigger or not but hes working there
4286028 were trying to get out best players out there including on special teams and he has an aptitude for it
4286029 hes the gunner on the punt team and hes working on being a punt return man he might have some other roles hes been working as a safety on the kickoff team he just wants to play
4286030 a guy in those positions could get banged up where he couldnt play qb thatd be scary but i think we just need him to play right now
4286031 in a sense it makes perfect sense that a bartender would react that way because we just dont get that many calls for nonalcoholic drinks
4286032 you can make virgin drinks but to be blunt a lot of bartenders dont know how
4286033 to me it was important to have a drink that youre excited to drink just like when youre not pregnant you shouldnt have to miss out
4286034 its amazing how many people who arent pregnant have commented on how much they love the drinks
4286035 you dont miss the alcohol you think you want it but you dont necessarily miss it
4286036 the question a bartender would rather not hear is whats good because its relative
4286037 do you want something creamy sweet or fruity sweet a fruit punch or a virgin daiquiri
4286038 i couldnt come up with anything close to a straight vodka martini with olives
4286039 and sangria was one of the hardest ones i cant tell you how many bottles of grape juice we went through trying to come up with that one
4286040 figure out what you like even if its a drink you always used to order
4286041 ask them to make you a mojito with pineapple juice instead of rum they may not know the substitute but if you give them one theyre more than happy to try
4286042 pain is good it lets you know your still alive
4286043 in some areas absence from work is clearly much too high
4286044 among some categories of staff absenteeism is a cause for concern
4286045 erin would have been very proud of the results she got in the leaving she was a very pleasant girl and all we can do now is pray for her and her family
4286046 i feel bad that i feel happy with my results knowing what happened to erin
4286047 the leaving certificate maths exam can be one of the most intimidating and many students drop from higher to ordinary level maths shortly beforehand
4286048 however it is so late in the season which runs mainly from may to august inclusive prices might not be fully reduced until next spring in order to evaluate how dairy markets behave in the interim
4286049 however even a relatively short period of holding milk prices above the true economic level could cost the main co ops including glanbia 2 million or more
4286050 farmers have already been forced to take a cut for milk while i understand 20 per tonne has now been shaved off the payment for grain
4286051 the market is however susceptible to change in the local and global economy as well as to political risks the group continues to expect to be profitable in 2008
4286052 most customers pay for the service by means of credit card and credit is only extended to customers who are assessed to be of strong financial standing
4286053 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4286054 he wants safe passage after breaking the law he wants safe passage after violating the constitution he wants safe passage after bargaining our sovereignty
4286055 i feel like im in the middle of a dream at the moment i telephoned my parents who are in the us as my dad is playing in the champions tour in oregon today
4286056 they were delighted naturally i have no definite plans for the win im going to take things easy and have a holiday later in the year
4286057 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4286058 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4286059 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4286060 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4286061 russias position is unchanged we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia in accordance with the un charter and not only do we support but we will guarantee them
4286062 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4286063 you wouldnt be human if you werent thinking about your future your familys future the players and other people who are employed by the club this is our livelihood and people have committed a lot to the club the club must survive and if it cant do that in its current guise it must survive in the long term
4286064 i hope the people who are governing and administering this football club will ensure that the best efforts are made to sustain people in employment
4286065 cork city football club has been engaged in negotiations with potential new investors for the last number of weeks it is too early to speculate on the outcome of these discussions which are still ongoing the board of cork city football club will meet next week and come to a decision on the future of the club
4286066 the football association of ireland has been in regular contact with the arkaga fund and cork city investment fc ltd the company operating cork city football club in relation to financial difficulties facing the cork city football club
4286067 it is the fais view that the clubs sustainability depends on its investors and directors managing the companys affairs as a sensible business we await news of what the arkaga fund as investors in cork city investment fc ltd intend to do if cork city investment fc ltd is in financial difficulty then the onus is on the clubs investors and directors to take all necessary corrective action to ensure its survival the fai has been and will continue to provide professional assistance to assist the club in any way possible at this difficult time
4286068 that probably arose because i did look at the club 12 months ago before the current owners came in i hate to see whats happening there and its particularly disappointing to see it happening to such a well supported club whether or not i would be interested in getting involved at this point as of now i just dont know
4286069 its disappointing news were probably one of the biggest clubs in the country and it looks like now that were not going anywhere
4286070 not getting paid last week set alarm bells ringing for sure
4286071 i cant believe the clubs changed so much in the space of seven months
4286072 its scary everyone knows were the best supported club in the country without cork city the league is in trouble hopefully theres some light at the end of the tunnel
4286073 my focus is on making sure that cork city are still in existence after all this
4286074 i dont want cork city collapsing as far as i am concerned the club has a future and will survive all this it has had a lot of issues in the past and survived and it will do so again

4286087 and what in the world did you two talk about
4286088 as they dashed hither and thither from boutique hotel to graphic design studio grabbing a panini as they went they certainly didnt look any more washed out or hopeless than the shallow wraiths who ride the tubes

4286103 allah c c yahudi ve hristiyanlari dost edinmelerini muminlere yasaklamis ve muminlerden onlari dost edinen kimsenin onlardan sayilacagini bildirmistir bu ise mecusileri putperestleri ve diger kafirleri dost edinen bir kimsenin hukmunun dost edindigi kafirlerin hukmu gibi oldugunu ve o kimsenin onlardan sayildigini gostermektedir

4286123 the survival horizon identifies the point in time after which a threatened population is expected to experience a catastrophic collapse
4286124 it is the point from which a species is unlikely to recover by identifying a survival horizon of 2042 geas has given human civilization a definite deadline for making substantive changes to planet and practices
4286125 each super threat on its own poses a serious challenge to the worlds adaptive capacity
4286126 acting together the five super threats may irreversibly overwhelm our species ability to survive
4286127 previous geas simulations with significantly less data and cross validation correctly forecasted the most surprising species collapses of the past decade anatidae chen so we have very good reason to believe that these simulation results while shocking do accurately represent the rapidly growing threats to the viability of the human species
4286128 we are grateful for geas work and we treat their latest forecast with seriousness and profound gravity

4286136 it is extremely important for parents to ensure that they and their children are protected against vaccine preventable diseases

4286141 it is important to refrain from any steps that could be directly or indirectly assessed by the georgian leadership as encouraging its vengeful ambitions or that could lead to a repetition of the tragic scenario
4286142 ask the american side and it can invite you the media to convince yourself that it is humanitarian aid on those transport planes why shouldnt they lift the curtain on what theyre carrying
4286143 we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past including with clear words when necessary towards russia
4286144 we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis hit region then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow

4286178 the new air services will improve the ease with which residents can access vital services such as specialist health care education and business opportunities removing the need for a three day trip
4286179 if the property is in our ownership we are politically accountable for what is done
4286180 but the people who are actually doing this are accountable to the spsa board this is fundamentally undemocratic
4286181 these proposals would save the scottish police service more than 3 million a year in vat

4286186 were asking that our children not only go to school but take another child with them
4286187 i dont have enough books to give every kid a book for them to be able to go home and do the homework assignment so i have to lessen what i do and do more in the classroom
4286188 if a kid is in front of me i can teach him
4286189 if we aint in school were out in the streets and thats why we have all these gang related problems
4286190 what is the success rate of using top smoking medications or getting involved into a quit smoking program
4286191 the power numbers have been awesome and for them to do that its just great
4286192 no one has ever had four infielders hit 25 plus home runs and i dont think anyone will ever do it again
4286193 a lot of times teams will have first basemen or third basemen that hit for power but to also have a second baseman do what uggla does and a shortstop do what hanley does its pretty amazing what theyve done
4286194 any time you can do anything like that its pretty special
4286195 theyre putting up good numbers and having a really good year i think the whole team is having a pretty good year
4286196 this game has been played a long time so for them to have four infielders hit 25 plus homers it would be a great feather in the cap at the end of the year
4286197 but if you ask the marlins theyd rather be playing in the playoffs

4286219 i got to throw a pitch run into home plate i even got the grounds crew to squirt me with the water i tried to do anything i could do ill probably never get a chance to do it again i think thats what all cubs fans would do
4286220 cubs fans dont lose we just dont win all the time someday we will so to call somebody a winner no its just a representative thats gonna go up there
4286221 i was nervous at the start but once i got in the middle i wasnt that nervous
4286222 it didnt hit me until i actually got out to the field and was like oh my goodness
4286223 i think if you get there and get to the game and see the whole crowd of people it will be really nerve wracking today was a casual atmosphere and it was nice
4286224 it will hit me when i see all the people and i will be nervous for the person who wins but its just for fun and were just so excited to make it to this point if i win itll be the icing on the cake
4286225 i know its going to be hard to compete with the other finalists and i said to myself i have to do something original something nobody else has done before so i practiced a little
4286226 im really confident in what im doing i also know that theres a lot of people who can sing and do better things than me i understand that but im 100 percent sure that im going to be the one it may sound like arrogance but thats my feeling
4286227 and we had actually because everything we did worked but we may also put an additional safeguard in
4286228 im hoping we can get the bugs out sometime before the postseason
4286229 whether we can make that timetable or not really hasnt been determined
4286230 well were working on the whole instant replay situation it didnt need a vote
4286231 im quite satisfied that were trying to get all the bugs out of it itll be very limited in its form as you know im a little reluctant to speak out about it until i know everything is working but we are moving in the right direction
4286232 theres a lot of work going on right now my concerns are the same every game i watch theres bats splintering im sensitive about it

4286236 i am opposed to same sex marriages for a number of reasons i believe marriage is a cornerstone of our society while i am always hesitant to amend the constitution i would support a carefully worded simple amendment stating marriage is between one man and one woman however i am adamantly opposed to courts legislating from the bench it is a fundamental cornerstone of the separation of powers in our form of government and all americans should be concerned when courts overturn laws without sound constitutional basis solely based on their interpretation of what our society now recognizes
4286237 millions of americans cant enjoy the legal protections of marriage because of their orientation i believe that two committed adults of the same sex should be able to enjoy full marriage rights in the united states and that no federal state or local jurisdiction should be able to deny any of the benefits of the marriage to same sex couples the so called defense of marriage act must be repealed

4286241 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4286242 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4286243 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4286244 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4286245 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4286246 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4286247 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4286248 we have a tighter standard our air quality hasnt gotten worse in this area we just are faced with a goal that is more stringent and more protective of public health

4286259 as our vice president for health affairs we believe bill crist will take the uas arizona health sciences center to the next level in terms of growth and success his excellent track record as a medical school dean and successful fundraiser as well as his noted work as a physician scientist provide the exact background we were seeking for this important new position arizona must address a severe shortage of physicians nurses pharmacists and other health professionals under dr crists leadership we will redouble our efforts to help address this crisis
4286260 were absolutely thrilled dr crist has accepted this key position at the ua with his vast experience as a health administrator and as a world class research scientist and physician he is the perfect individual to help guide development of our health sciences colleges and expansion in phoenix
4286261 im extremely excited to have the opportunity to lead the fast emerging arizona health sciences center i truly believe the sky is the limit for the uas health colleges and its clinical enterprise if we work together plan appropriately and are successful in gaining additional resources the arizona health sciences center in tucson provides first class facilities that house excellent academic research and clinical programs and the new campus in phoenix provides a remarkable opportunity for innovative health education research and patient care however to ensure successful growth at both campuses we must emphasize collaboration among the three state universities and the arizona board of regents with the legislature and the governors office and with private industry and foundations i believe such collaboration is absolutely key to the kind of success we hope to achieve
4286262 im glad two people called and found out i wasnt lying
4286263 its one of those cities i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan howard is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4286264 and i think that maybe theyre like we dont show up which is what i guess front runner means theyre only on your side when youre winning
4286265 there are definitely games dont get me wrong where im like damn you know we are getting booed and we need to get booed because were not doing well
4286266 the whole thing was look here we are in the playoffs were at home were in first place theres really nothing to boo about were not going to win every game as long as we win by one when it comes down to the finish but go out there and support us when carlos ruiz comes up to the plate dont boo him because you want chris coste in the game this man has a job to do today encourage him to do his job to the best of his abilities
4286267 the term front runner and what it actually means and to what i was using it what was going through my mind they werent accurate front runners is like people who only show up when youre winning hey were going to cheer you if you win thats not it about philly fans theyre passionate they show up like i said 45 000 weve got like 42 sellouts they announce it everynight thats not what i meant like i said its the fact that here we are at this point of the year come out and be supportive dont necessarily get on us we can use that positve energy and you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down

4286270 shirley came in and out of our lives over the years
4286271 she did her first co op with us in 97 later she did work in guyana at one point and in chad
4286272 it was a real shock to be in the car and hear her name on cbc in relation to such a tragic incident
4286273 she sent us an e mail after she got there saying she was going to be working with an inclusive education program which focused on children with sensory disabilities and integrating them into community based schools
4286274 so the idea is to build the capacity of the communities to have local schools which will eventually hopefully become part of the ministry of education responsibilities
4286275 i hope to influence change in the world looking at community building and how it is impacted by youth women and people living with disabilities
4286276 she had them while she was here as well thats what she was interested in here and she followed her heart she was a very nice enthusiastic very dedicated person and she could connect with people

4286320 they feel the economy will work its way out up and down but if you dont have security you have nothing
4286321 but yet we have become a society in america that has pretty much priced itself out of the market
4286322 i think if people in america had to really buy everything american they really couldnt afford to do it so there needs to be that balance there
4286323 we try to promote our end of agriculture as best as possible and with the prices of the commodities that are out there today and the prices of ground and what it takes to operate and run a farm theres getting to be less and less actual working farms out there
4286324 for instance public transportation isnt something that really ranks high on my list of things whereas if there are some more commodity based subsidy programs or something like that i could really appreciate that a lot more
4286325 i just keep hoping that in the long run they know whats best for us and can find the right individuals to take us into the future
4286326 thats why we have certain republicans that are elected because the conservative issues are important
4286327 i just said you know what thats whats great about america you have the right to do that because i know better than to argue i would certainly hope she changes her mind by november 4 but im not going to argue with her on august 11 about that because that would make her more staunch

4286344 we were pleased with the wacas reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment
4286345 we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4286346 conveyed the new dates to the icc and they are fine with it
4286347 our analysis of the data shows a clear association between obesity and an increased risk for dementia and several clinical subtypes of the disease
4286348 subjects with a healthy body mass index bmi and waist circumference saw a decreased risk for dementia than their counterparts with an elevated bmi or waist circumference
4286349 preventing or treating obesity at a younger age could play a major role in reducing the number of dementia patients and those with other commonly associated illnesses such as alzheimers disease by up to 20 in the united states
4286350 currently alzheimers disease is the eighth leading cause of death among the elderly population in the united states
4286351 while more studies are needed to determine optimal weight and biological mechanisms associated with obesity and dementia these findings could potentially decrease the number of people diagnosed with dementia and lead to an overall better quality of life

4286381 the longstanding notoriety of idlewild apartments is of great concern to nearby neighborhoods whose well being is called into question by proximity to this complex

4286384 he didnt have the chance to do his regular routine with gatorade and water gatorade and water
4286385 that had been under control it had gotten better each year that he played football
4286386 its tricky but if you have the medication to reduce the inflammation and their lung function is as good as a normal person you can let them be active
4286387 that was his dream to be able to go there whether he played football or not
4286388 he was just a great son we loved him dearly hes going to be truly missed
4286389 no one who knew atlas can say that they couldnt see the potential he had
4286390 he was just a funny guy its going to be tough without him
4286391 he was a young man who was a class act very well liked
4286392 something like this reminds everyone that sports arent always whats important family is more important
4286393 if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
4286394 although it was winning the battle for individual hearts in millions of cases throughout christendom christianity was no longer winning the battle for the minds of individuals lives were changed churches were transformed some major legislative changes were introduced but the foundations of doctrine were not consolidated the christian world and life view was gradually lost and christianity became for the first time since constantine primarily a private religion
4286395 darwinism exposes christianitys weakness in keeping up with the growing scientific knowledge we use the fruits of scientific technology and blissfully ignore its implications for a contemporary and comprehensive biblical worldview
4286396 scientific development has only occurred in a christian culture the ancients had brains as good as ours in all civilizations science developed to a certain point and then stopped it is easy to argue speculatively that perhaps science might have been able to develop in the absence of christianity but in fact it never did and no wonder for the non christian world believed that there was something ethically wrong about science in greece this conviction was enshrined in the legend of prometheus the fire bearer and prototype scientist who stole fire from heaven thus incurring the wrath of the gods
4286397 baron scooter pikes had been confined cuffed and was nonconfrontational there was no need to kill him nevertheless scott nugent a louisiana police officer stunned pikes repeatedly with a taser the man was dead before the last two 50 000 volt shocks were delivered surmised cnn an autopsy revealed no evidence of drug use in pikes system he had been detained for possession nugent was indicted this month on a charge of manslaughter
4286398 the taser x26 has become a fixture in the increasingly fractious interactions between the police and the people
4286399 something has gotten into the countrys lymphatic system and the infection becomes most apparent in these street level scuffles between the state and its subjects
4286400 if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray to the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever

4286402 we have more than 50 per cent more accidents than what queensland are having at their level crossings
4286403 we know that there are 1400 crossings across the state that only have stop signs and give way signs and the brumby government has been very slow to upgrade those crossings
4286404 i hope everybody will put in some money so we can buy it if everybody put in what they could we would be able to buy it
4286405 id hate the thought of it going back because we couldnt find the money
4286406 inventory data is not linked to customer names and not shared with anyone within or outside of microsoft
4286407 this is a fairly remarkable streak when the guys are all playing well like this you have this feeling that you can always come back we definitely feel like were going to win when its close in the seventh
4286408 when weve won weve always pitched well when youre playing like were playing you start to feel a little invincible
4286409 today i went away from him but i figured i would try to go in on him again and he was sitting on it i just caught too much of the plate and he hit it pretty good
4286410 he hinshaw made a mistake he threw one right down the middle which is not what we want him to do in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt have gotten a pitch like that but he did
4286411 but like i said people have to be level headed and have to be healthy before you can settle a feud
4286412 weve written eight nine songs we just got to go in the studio sept 1
4286413 diffrent types who wear a day coat pants with stripes and cutaway coat perfect fits puttin on the ritz
4286414 hmm is it real do i really get to choose the music because if i do im in
4286415 what a great opportunity for me to basically design a concert for myself that i would want to go to
4286416 do i really get to choose the music are there strings attached
4286417 cant you guys just leave well enough alone youve killed your damn franchise and now you want to sodomize the remains
4286418 hes a fantastic performer and its vital we keep him one thing he can do is to take our promising crop of youngsters under his wing
4286419 when he came up here i told him it was probably for a short period of time
4286420 its a shame he had his first outing yesterday it wasnt real good but it was his first outing
4286421 unfortunately it took a little longer but thats in the past now
4286422 its just good to be here and hopefully be able to contribute here
4286423 radio was what connected mauritanians taught us that there was a state that there was a president and there were ministers and there was a parliament
4286424 there were shows with singers and we took time to sit and listen to the music but when al balaghat came on it was more important the other world was for leisure but this was something that could change your life
4286425 with a destructive song she wraps a scarf around her head or slips into her about soundroots
4286426 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
4286427 its in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
4286428 lastly icelandic is also related to these three but far more distantly and it has a much more complex grammar being more conservative in that it has maintained much the same form over the past nine centuries or so thats why icelandic people can still read the old norse sagas
4286429 when she looked at it she determined that due to flooding the river could actually could have been up to that level where the bones were found at that time it deserved a second look
4286430 at the end of all that process the dna remaining inside the bone samples themselves is in very poor shape and it makes it very difficult to retrieve any dna out of it
4286431 for instance if we have some found human remains and we develop a mitochondrial dna type from there we can now compare that type to suspected brothers or sisters of that individual we can also look at mothers and aunts or female cousins along that line
4286432 thats very useful because it can be very difficult to track down relatives and get dna to have some comparisons to do without the relatives we cant make any identifications at all
4286433 look youve already blown off two other friday challenges since this one why dont you just declare it a three way tie and move on
4286434 the sharp rise in bank repossessions combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4286435 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news well get for a while
4286436 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4286437 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4286438 it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
4286439 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4286440 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
4286441 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
4286442 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4286443 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4286444 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved
4286445 if i can do anything to help bring some good things back i am willing to do that
4286446 i raced against marion a couple of times i have never really had a conversation with her it was devastating to see what happened to her it would have been great if my role model could have been clean and still been my role model i was just a high school athlete looking up to the superstar
4286447 hopefully in the future we can do more things like that with athletes taking the initiative
4286448 the marion jones thing was just another step backwards and particularly in america its my responsibility and other athletes that we are just trying to bring some hope back into it and some credibility
4286449 once all the running is done i want to teach
4286450 my mum is a teacher and i pretty much grew up in her classroom i have always had a passion for children ever since i was little its what i wanted to do i enjoy track i love it but its not my only goal in life i would be just as happy as i am now if i was in a classroom somewhere
4286451 teaching has been a dream way longer than i have been introduced to track and field i havent put a time frame on it i am going to keep going while i am enjoying it and then go in the classroom i am doing it year by year i dont have a big master plan
4286452 in 2004 i didnt know what to expect i was all about enjoying the games now to come back this time it is all about business veronica is an amazing competitor weve raced each other for a long time now and this race is going to be more exciting than they all have been
4286453 i am not recognised in the streets it is just normal the way it has always been
4286454 i am a regular person it could change but i live in los angeles track and field is not really up there
4286455 it is a financial decision and must be seen as such
4286456 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4286457 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and first hand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work
4286458 sometimes in spite of himself he finds himself involved in policy matters by superiors who wish to take advantage of his name
4286459 this is really the next step in how do we better support families
4286460 our intent would be that if we move forward with the initiative that we would put all day kindergarten in place by 2009
4286461 were obviously looking across the country at what other jurisdictions are doing in terms of early learning
4286462 we have to finish our homework and basically prepare a report back to government before the end of the year
4286463 investing in early childhood education and opportunities for children earlier does save us investments in the long run
4286464 right now about 25 per cent of our children one in four arrive at the kindergarten door and theyre not developmentally ready to be there
4286465 early childhood learning is pivotally important because it sets the foundation for lifelong learning
4286466 you decrease the likelihood that they are going to encounter problems later on and when you encounter problems later on its very painful for the kids and their families
4286467 thats disappointing to me my expectation is for the goldman sachs brand my expectation for that is they would honor their position and statement of these securities as cash and cash equivalents
4286468 you put these issues in terms that are meaningful to me its not that youre asking me to give something to somebody else you dont talk like other people in your party youre asking me to be a part of something that makes the whole state better
4286469 its like telling white women meaning mooncat and me im sure that since the average life expectancy of a white female is 81 well well going to cut off your social security at age 81
4286470 we have to find the health care gaps and plug them 30 of health costs are administrative and thats just too high we have to address the fact that we spend more on health care than any other nation but we dont have the most efficient system
4286471 unfortunately there has been some mix up over the whereabouts of gregs south african passport
4286472 but we are doing everything possible to get this sorted out
4286473 the prospect of getting a bit of money back is always appealing but more importantly greg has taken another step forward in his career with this innings
4286474 i found out my granddaughter has been taken she has been missing for a month were talking about a 3 year old little girl i need to find her
4286475 i found my daughters car today and it smells like theres a dead body in the damn car
4286476 a l tat sauvage comme en captivit les bonobos femelles ont des contacts sexuels intenses entre elles
4286477 but im going to risk it and come out and enjoy mother nature i love to be outdoors
4286478 but its important to heal its important to go on and people do understand this
4286479 when it comes to our families and our children it chokes me up
4286480 i would never recommend anyone to just use alternative medicine
4286481 i believe its a complimentary type of session with there traditional medical doctor
4286482 biofeedback properly timed properly done is a tremendously powerful aid
4286483 it can be used to recognize for instance when youre getting very stressed it can be used to short circuit anxiety responses
4286484 i think the biggest issue could be relying on certain natural medications for cures or treatments for disease when there are very well studied very safe and established medications
4286485 licensed animal use remains essential to develop improved healthcare technologies
4286486 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4286487 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
4286488 new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce
4286489 i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research
4286490 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering

4286495 from time to time the u s government investigate s whether we conduct our operations in accordance with applicable regulatory
4286496 we have regular investigations from the us attorneys to see whether weve violated any laws
4286497 we worked out a deal where we paid 2million to various community groups to escape from being prosecuted
4286498 because of low concentrations and short duration of the exposure it is not likely that the spill event caused an overexposure or chronic health impacts
4286499 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4286500 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4286501 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer

4286503 the performers are wearing diapers during rehearsals so they dont have to take bathroom breaks
4286504 thats when a man he was wearing a mask over his face and had braids that may have been dreadlocks came around the corner and started shooting
4286505 i looked down the street to see who he was shooting at i thought it was paintballs all i saw was his eyes i looked in his eyes and i saw he was angry
4286506 i dont even know why he was shooting at me
4286507 he had to be shooting from just 15 feet away it was like something was shielding me that all of those bullets didnt hit me

4286514 of the 15 leading causes of death seven are directly associated with lifestyle choices nutrition habits lack of exercise smoking and so on
4286515 the best defense against conditions such as diabetes obesity and hypertension is often education knowing what to do and how to make it practical is the first step and finding the motivation is the next
4286516 employer sponsored programs are a huge motivator for many employees and spouses who might not take the time or initiative to seek health education
4286517 the financial toll of these common health risks on companies across the country is in the billions of dollars each year
4286518 companies that make wellness part of their culture stand a better chance at stabilizing health insurance costs reducing absenteeism and increasing productivity and morale
4286519 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance

4286526 lo ltimo que tuve conocimiento es que la direcci n de inteligencia militar el organismo por la parte militar estaba en guasdualito hab a una idea de que ser an trasladados a caracas pero las relaciones internacionales con colombia y la fluidez como trabajan la canciller a venezolana y colombiana no se si tendr an que ir a caracas no se ve como un incidente de m xima importancia porque no portaban armas
4286527 la diferenciaci n de un estado y otro es dif cil el pueblo all es uno solo si un oficial del ej rcito colombiano pasa a venezuela sin autorizaci n nosotros tenemos que actuar
4286528 este domingo va a haber una reuni n de alto nivel entre los cancilleres de venezuela y uruguay

4286530 al ser inhabilitado el se or presidente para seguir decretando leyes se abre la posibilidad para que los diputados retomemos nuestras competencias constitucionales de desarrollar las leyes que le den a los ciudadanos la posibilidad de alcanzar ese tan anhelado desarrollo econ mico y sobre todo la justicia social
4286531 hoy muestra de eso pudimos alcanzar el desarrollo en la discusi n de una ley que es important sima como es la ley de extorsi n y secuestro esperemos que cuando se abra el segundo periodo de discusiones parlamentarios podamos traer leyes que puedan hacer demostrar que el trabajo que pueda emanar de esta asamblea no es otro que entregarle al pueblo esas leyes que le garanticen todos los servicios y beneficios
4286532 un delito que se ha convertido en un negocio muy importante cerca de 14 mil millones de bol vares se han pagado en rescate en lo que va de a o y estamos acerc ndonos cerca de 400 secuestros
4286533 muchos rumores sobre la exportaci n de la pr ctica del secuestro a los pa ses vecinos de colombia y por eso quisimos investigar
4286534 la mano dura ha sido efectiva pero no es suficiente para solucionar la pr ctica del secuestro
4286535 yo aspiro ser militante del partido nico o del psuv o de otro que la circunstancia nos diga que debe ser pero yo estoy demasiado comprometido con la unidad
4286536 hubo una decisi n en la alianza patri tica contra el partido joven y el mep yo no estaba presente porque los representantes nuestros que yo propuse fueron wilmer nolasco y manuel sierra all hay un problema con mackled un candidato a alcalde de valencia all hubo una decisi n precipitada
4286537 las precipitaciones no son buenas porque mario silva el candidato del psuv ha acusado a lina ron de todo y han acusado tambi n al gobernador del estado gu rico de todo sin embargo lina ron est en la alianza y el ppt tambi n
4286538 se supone que cada partido ha debido esperar este momento para hacer las evaluaciones y correctivos del caso yo reconozco que hubo un descuido en carabobo y en otros tambi n pues en tres estados los combatientes ten an ordenes de inscribir a los candidatos del psuv y por debilidades afectivas inscribieron a otros
4286539 estamos muy comprometidos con el presidente y con la revoluci n
4286540 el proceso de integraci n del psuv es complejo y mi sue o es que al final todos estemos incorporados en una sola organizaci n que puede ser el psuv de todos los partidos que estamos con el presidente de la rep blica hubo dos partidos que dijeron que no a la propuesta del presidente y otro grupo que fue lina ron upv y el mep creo que lo que pas all es que el proceso fue bastante lento y entonces vino la coyuntura electoral yo creo que falt un m todo porque el mep tiene una personalidad jur dica que proteger un inmenso patrimonio y era necesario adem s de la integraci n con las bases alg n mecanismo de integraci n formal en lo administrativo yo creo que ah cometimos errores
4286541 la convocatoria de instalar al congreso fundacional casi coincidi con el vencimiento del lapso para actualizar la personalidad jur dica de los partidos lo que se llama el registro ante el cne y nosotros no pod amos dejarlo pasar porque si no actualiz bamos el registro quedaban desiertas la personalidad jur dica y los bienes del partido se perd an no iban a servir ni para el mep ni para el psuv
4286542 la justa aspiraci n de distintos l deres a medirse se respeta pero el pa s hoy siente la inconveniencia de este gobierno que limita nuestros derechos como ciudadanos y le da m s y m s poder al estado y convierte al presidente en ejecutor absoluto de las pol ticas nacionales afectando cada d a m s la propiedad privada la empresa productiva y las regiones entre otros
4286543 nos obliga a que la oposici n exprese sus inclinaciones al aspirante que mejor la representa la opci n de triunfo bien sea como alcalde o gobernador y se logren acuerdos donde la sociedad civil act e como mediador para fortalecer a ese candidato y convencer a los otros aspirantes a hacer un s lo frente opositor que obtenga el triunfo en el mayor n mero gobernaciones y alcald as
4286544 pese a los avances en la cooperaci n internacional varios factores incluyendo las limitaciones de recursos y falta de voluntad pol tica han impedido que ee uu progrese en su ayuda para que los gobiernos sean socios plenos y autosuficientes en los esfuerzos antinarc ticos
4286545 esto es particularmente cierto en venezuela que debido a las tensas relaciones con ee uu ha dejado de cooperar en las iniciativas antinarc ticos estadounidenses desde 2005

4286549 if nelson rockefeller hadnt bought the place there wouldnt be a club
4286550 theyre all over a hundred and it isnt even a club thats why they call it the century association
4286551 they put a tag on everybody i guess they have to they never say theyre dining with so and so its always so and so president of such and such and then they both deduct each other from their income tax
4286552 they get some fellow who doesnt know the first thing about clubs and the first thing he knows hes in there and then where is he
4286553 its everybody and his friends why they even have two entirely different crowds its textile men at lunch and lawyers at dinner they never even speak to each other
4286554 they can talk about their library all they want its a rather crowded and not very exclusive hotel nobody knows who anybody is and half the time nobodys even heard of the college theyre from its like a cemetery in there at night and at lunch time its like jones beach
4286555 they do nothing but drink and gamble and talk about their rice pudding
4286556 who wants to join a club on account of rice pudding
4286557 theyre always telling you about their big shot executives and how strong they are out of town they have to be i guess because in new york nobody even knows where they are
4286558 i had to go over there a year ago and tell them it was their fiftieth anniversary
4286559 i could take you up there for lunch it wouldnt be a good lunch i mean to say and it wouldnt be a bad lunch i mean to say it just wouldnt be anything
4286560 that chooses its members mentally now isnt that a hell of a way to run a club
4286561 men whose personality is not remarkably brilliant and who standing by themselves would not he apt to arouse a great deal of enthusiasm among their associates on account of their intellectual capacity
4286562 very frequently counteract these drawbacks by joining a well known club thus it will be seen that a club often lends a generous hand to persons who with out this assistance might ever remain in obscurity
4286563 i never did find out who the first one was
4286564 the only reason i got into the century in 1931
4286565 was because they thought i was john nicholas brown the worlds richest baby
4286566 what is the use of any social system in which women do not participate
4286567 in which their petticoat is not seen where glossy ringlets cannot enter and make it paradise
4286568 at the river we have very few what i call tea cozies
4286569 except me but were a very successful club for nowadays
4286570 that the union club has come to a day when a man can bring his mistress to the club
4286571 if the lady is the wife of one of the members
4286572 engaged in or interested in the liberal arts or professions
4286573 the colony has had very little to talk about anyway
4286574 of a harvard man saying he was going over to the har
4286575 where i can take a couple of friends without producing a birth certificate a marriage license and a blood test
4286576 who wants to go into a dining room where youre the only one there except for thomas j watson whos explaining to someone how he got eisenhower to be president of columbia
4286577 i dont know what clubs alfred belongs to and whats more i dont think he does either
4286578 at the metropolitan or the union league or the university
4286579 you might do a 10 000 deal but youd use the knickerbocker or the union or the racquet for 100 000 and then for 1 000 000 youd move on to the brook or the links
4286580 is sort of like english titles to an american theyre still very impressive but to an englishman the earl of warwick isnt necessarily any more social than just plain mister charles winn

4286585 many hundreds of years before chief powhatan s reign fairies were dancing around a spring of water playing with naiads and wood nymphs when an elfin messenger arrived from a city far away he brought news of the death of christ when these creatures of the forest heard the story of the crucifixion they wept as their tears fell upon the earth they crystallized to form beautiful crosses

4286591 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states

4286593 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4286594 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4286595 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4286596 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4286597 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4286598 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4286599 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4286600 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4286601 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4286602 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
4286603 the space of human life and action with its cultural social economic moral and political dimensions where networks are woven loyalties and hierarchies disputed and opinion and determination forged
4286604 israel must allow diplomatic efforts to move ahead lower the tone of the military threat and understand that dialogue with iran is essential to an attempt to reduce its military motivation

4286623 taxonomic intelligence is the inclusion of taxonomic practices skills and knowledge within informatics services to manage information about organisms
4286624 an information need cannot be fully expressed as a search request that is independent of innumerable presuppositions of context context that itself is impossible to describe fully for it includes among other things the requesters own background of knowledge
4286625 a document cannot be considered relevant to an information need independently of all other documents that the requester may take into account
4286626 machines cannot recognize meaning and so cannot duplicate what human judgment in principle can bring to the process of indexing and classifying documents corollary some indexers all of the time and all indexers some of the time also cannot duplicate what human judgment in principle can bring to the process of indexing
4286627 word occurrence statistics can neither represent meaning nor substitute for it
4286628 you can have subtle relevance judgments or highly effective mechanized procedures but not both
4286629 consistently effective fully automatic indexing and retrieval is not possible

4286633 l ike every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4286658 were seeing a lot more interests after this 2008 flood so i think well see more support and we do need people to write letters to congressmen to say we want to have improvements take place

4286664 since the 19th century but particularly since the 1940s with modern supreme court jurisprudence theres been this firewall and the firewall has basically said you can fund secular activities of religious organizations and institutions but you cant fund their religious activities
4286665 this tenth circuit decision is just another chipping away at that firewall
4286666 the old presumption was that if you had a really religious institution government couldnt fund it no matter how you channel it
4286667 now the court is saying once you have a funding program that affects the whole class you cant exclude some institutions because theyre religious you must fund them
4286668 expressly discriminates among religions without constitutional justification and its criteria for doing so involve unconstitutionally intrusive scrutiny of religious belief and practice
4286669 i think we do better to treat all institutions equally in these matters rather than to have the government drawing distinctions
4286670 funding everybody or funding nobody are two good alternatives funding some people and not others produces incentives to change your religious behavior
4286671 given the tradition of church state separation how high a wall between the two is a matter for debate and the constitution gives a fair amount of leeway to the states in what they decide to fund
4286672 proving a proposition by showing its opposite to be false alongside the dirtier words that fill the low concept high profile film he co wrote with big screen bout star wars the clone wars vs
4286673 its important to say that whats being parodied is certainly not any actual black human being but the ideas in the actors mind of what an african american would be
4286674 its a movie that was not afraid to go for it in every possible way
4286675 people were saying there was one good role for an african american actor and they gave it to robert downey jr they were saying with a straight face exactly what we were saying in the movie that felt great
4286676 for many years its been interesting to me how hollywood tends to romanticize
4286677 instead of looking at it in a realistic way theyve sort of fetishized it like oh wouldnt it be great if we were all retarded wouldnt that be like the perfect world to me one of the great moments is to be able to call it out you have to to understand why its absurd
4286678 you never saw someone as angry as he was after seeing forrest gump
4286679 he said you think its funny being raised by a person like that he learned to read by reading the comics to his father
4286680 theyd say its not kosher what are you doing cmon i always strongly disagreed the point of the show was to hold up a mirror to the way people act and the attitudes they have if you think its glorifying people sitting around on a couch the way they do youre probably missing the point
4286681 you laughed at it because it was a guy getting kicked in the balls and then you could laugh at it because it was a parody of the kinds of shows we all watched i hope tropic thunder works on that same level multifaceted with something for everybody to enjoy
4286682 thats why the guys a movie star its an amazing rediscovery of how funny he is
4286683 ive been watching for seven straight hours and there hasnt been a damn thing on

4286686 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4286687 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
4286688 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
4286689 double consciousness a sense of always looking at ones self through the eyes of others
4286690 honestly i was not sure what i wanted to do
4286691 peter horacheck got the head job in milwaukee and asked if i wanted to play but my body had just had enough i was just an athlete retiring not sure what i was going to do but coaching was a thought and an option
4286692 the players work the least and are paid the most as they should be
4286693 when peter went to nashville claude noel came in and he really challenged me
4286694 i was coaching but probably not going 100 percent he talked to me like a player and made me become more vested as a coach that was a big turning point i had three years under claude and learned more because i was vested then my coaching career took off peter saw something in me and claude brought it out
4286695 i was probably more of a north stars fan than a gophers fan but to be a part of it for four years was great the campus is right in minneapolis and i could go home on sundays my parents were a big part of my life and to have them close by and have them watch games was important
4286696 i was a senior in high school and i remember being at home
4286697 at that stage the build up to the draft was not like now i had heard i would probably be in the top 3 rounds i went in the second round and got a call that day to tell the truth i think i might have been getting ready for a baseball game
4286698 they took tom chorske in the first round that year
4286699 it was strange two american players were chosen by the montreal organization back then they were very pro quebec and canadian team much like the university of minnesota who was all minnesota kids with the exception of the two goalies montreal had great pride in the quebec players
4286700 i never played in san jose but i did play in the cow palace against the spiders
4286701 i played in the goodwill games in 1991 and we had an exhibition in oakland it was full and a great atmosphere
4286702 i did play in the stanley cup playoffs and take great pride in playing in the playoffs and going deep at every level
4286703 someone brought up that ive made the playoffs each year as a player and a coach during my four years in minnesota i make the frozen four all four years
4286704 peter said a long time ago to surround yourself with good people
4286705 i truly believe that some people come to the rink hoping to win and some come expecting to win

4286724 he consistently proves himself a free thinking fly angler and seems to be less affected by the currents of the mainstream angling thought that others seem to depend on for cognitive direction
4286725 many thoughts flooded through my mind upon first reading jim mclennans newest book water marks thirty years of fly fishing insight for me mclennans book is refreshing because he consistently proves himself a free thinking fly angler and seems to be less affected by the currents of the mainstream angling thought that others seem to depend on for cognitive direction his insight requires the attention of all of us but especially the next generation fly angler for i believe that parts of his angling philosophies directly contrast with the direction that fly fishing culture is currently heading the younger guys who have taken up and are taking over fly fishing have changed the sport and will continue to change the sport that is for certain but the more magazines i pick up and the more calendars i see i feel myself becoming increasingly worried with the inevitable change in direction
4286726 i dont really know what to call the new hybrid fly angler and i dont know if there has been a term applied to this ambitious lot they seem to be a perfect mixture between genius and dropout the stereotypical modern fly fisher reminds me a little of the kid who has all the potential to do well in school but is not motivated by achieving the grade their passion is driven by a specific aspect of the sport the knowledge of science and mechanics the new angler seems to believe they can know everything that has anything to do with making a trout rise and understand all the mysteries behind a piece of water new technology and an intimate knowledge of casting bring them to the place where they can cast farther and quicker they are a machine of sorts
4286727 the hybrid fly angler is becoming a leader and we must give him credit for his scientific knowledge of rod materials and his unsurpassed understanding of entomology but there is something missing for when one focuses too much on a single aspect of an issue there are other components that naturally get neglected
4286728 mclennan directly tells his audience that we must realize that being a fly angler is about being part of something larger than ourselves
4286729 fly fishing used to be a funky blend of tradition and technology but lately the tradition side had taken a beating were losing our sense of heritage and without it the soul of our sport will wither and croak
4286730 our year to date sales growth of 99 for the ps3 reaffirms that consumers are indeed embracing ps3 as their entertainment hub of choice with its feature rich offerings like blu ray and our recently announced video delivery service with an unmatched software line up that includes littlebigplanet socom confrontation resistance 2 and motorstorm pacific rift and the anticipated launch of our new 80gb ps3 model were confident in a strong second half of the year and look forward to quickly addressing any inventory shortages due to the transition

4286735 there is very little educational value in these dioramas a frozen moment cannot tell us anything significant about animal behaviour instead the dioramas feel more like trophy rooms where each diorama captures a particular moment in an african safari hunting spree where you the intrepid hunter can take a pot shot at your favourite game animal

4286742 i am pleased to report that each quarter smart move has consistently increased bookings and sales thanks to the efforts of our internal sales team
4286743 to put these sales developments in perspective we are just now in our third full moving season and the company is beginning to benefit from brand recognition referrals and repeat customers this momentum combined with our improved web presence has increased internal sales opportunities operationally we continue to aggressively monitor and reduce our costs of moving and storage i think it important to note that our sales have increased by 30 this quarter over prior year 2007s comparable sales during the same three month period while our direct costs of sales have increased by only 6 over the same three month period as compared to second quarter 2007 in addition our selling general and administrative costs have remained flat as compared with the prior year periods demonstrating the success of our efforts to increase operating leverage on these expenses
4286744 we continue to face hurdles in funding our operations securing the additional capital we need to implement and advance our business model continues to command our urgent attention as weve discussed in our 10 q for the quarter ended june 30 2008

4286788 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4286790 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4286820 a lot of water is going to hit that village
4286821 theres going to be a lot more problems than there already is
4286822 the water hasnt gotten to the bottom of the bridge yet but at this point theyre watching it very closely
4286823 we had the rollovers there but what really made it worse was a lot of debris and a lot of water that hit there so were not quite sure why the trucks rolled over if it was a product of the winds or a debris situation
4286824 one of our local guys on the scene said there was a ton of branches and just junk blown on the freeway
4286825 poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problem
4286826 sustainable development as an approach to environment implies meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their needs

4286828 mechanisation is good when the hands are few for the work intended to be accomplished
4286829 against the background of achievement is all the more staggering shameful that more than one billion people in the developing world are living in poverty progress in raising average in comes however welcome must not distract attention from this massive and continuing burden of poverty 11 for removal of poverty and unemployment it was suggested that

4286836 i was deeply honored to be selected as one of four finalists for the position of chancellor at uw madison an institution with which i have long personal and professional ties and where i count many friends and colleagues among the faculty and staff

4286842 lauren and i are certainly different types of superdelegates she and i are both college students we are both part of the youtube generation
4286843 we thought this would be a great way to communicate to people about who we are
4286844 it was pretty overwhelming which candidate they wanted us to move toward
4286845 the only appropriate thing was for us to make an endorsement
4286846 we compete in a national and global market for top shelf talent and the best available data show that salaries in the uw system are generally not keeping pace with those offered by similar institutions elsewhere
4286847 i look forward to the opportunity to work with wisconsin citizens and their representatives to ensure that their families benefit from the preparation and the innovation that uw madison provides for this changing world
4286848 our work will not be easy but i believe we will be equal to the task if we work together and focus on the things that matter
4286849 i am delighted that wid will be led by john wiley he is a perfect fit for the mission and science of the new institute
4286850 it has been an extraordinary experience for me to have served as interim director for the past two years and i have learned a great deal in the process there is no one better able than john wiley to build on the foundation we have established and to take wid into the future
4286851 i think so i think a lot of it might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities
4286852 you know the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrip s the bobby allison s and others we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect
4286853 all the drivers do is turn their steering wheels and push their feet to the floor anybody can do that

4286860 there are four pro leagues in the world that every professional player wants to play in and ive been fortunate enough to play in three of them
4286861 hopefully in 20 or 30 years mls will be on par with those its only been around for 13 years ive played for teams that started in 1885
4286862 one of the best ways to have an attacking style of play is to have offensive players who are confident in their defense and in their goalkeeper

4286872 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
4286873 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4286874 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4286875 soon according to court papers he had to rely on other detainees to help him reach the toilet bring him food and call his family he no longer received painkillers because he could not stand in line to collect them
4286876 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4286877 what shocked me was that within 24 hours one half of those arrested 200 people had been whisked away to texas to send them back out of the country as soon as possible
4286878 bond is important because it starts the whole process of realizing the rights you are guaranteed by the constitution of the united states
4286879 i couldnt have continued caring for my family they had no idea what had happened with me but this way at least my children can see me in person
4286880 its as if im being pursued because of my past acts
4286881 people are continuously surprised to find out hes still alive
4286882 he could easily be dismissed as absolutely crazy but if you sit with him and give him an opening he will convert you
4286883 his worldview is internally consistent and based upon an adherence to divine authority found in sacred and historical texts
4286884 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 welcome friends
4286885 russias primary concern was that we were exaggerating the iranian threat and therefore these sites in europe must be directed at them that was their primary concern and weve gone a long way to try to dissuade them of that notion
4286886 russias objections to the sites have never been based on anything more than trying to define a sphere of influence in europe and on the territory of existing nato members senator mccain believes that is unacceptable especially in the aftermath of russias brutal invasion of georgia
4286887 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
4286888 deployment of elements of the u s global antimissile system in eastern europe only makes the situation worse we will need to react to this adequately our american and european partners have been warned
4286889 we provide a service around certain parameters and after hours we only bring in a radiologist for urgent or life threatening cases and this didnt fit the criteria
4286890 the patients treatment wouldnt have been any different even if she had the x ray that night and the follow up care would have been the same the small delay has had no impact on the patients condition or recovery
4286891 as a parent any possible break or fracture of your childs bones is major
4286892 i can understand the mothers concern its extremely natural concern of any parent but unfortunately we dont have the resources to provide a radiologist all the time nor could we justify having a radiologist on all the time it is a huge cost and for a lot of the time they would be idle and i dont think people would think that was the best use of their tax dollars
4286893 i wouldnt call myself a designer but ive been playing with fabric and sewing all of my life i was a typical girl and at one stage wanted to be a dress designer
4286894 i drew a whole lot of lines onto paper and ironed it on
4286895 like a lot of my art it pretty much evolved
4286896 it has been fun i like to make my own clothes occasionally and this has inspired me to do a bit more of that stuff
4286897 the youth advisory committee has a unique position to promote the views of young people as well as participate as members of the community on issues that affect all of us
4286898 i look forward to the young people providing their insights to myself staff and councillors on the way they experience the manning valley what is great and what needs to be done to make it better
4286899 i felt the incredible positive energy of the young people their ideas and aspirations
4286900 i know that they will encourage other young people to express their views on issues of importance and concern as well as the values they wish to cultivate in our area
4286901 i was very pleased with the number of young people who nominated to be a part of the committee
4286902 they are bright energetic and articulate and full of good ideas
4286903 they are open to new information and are keen to make a contribution to the life of the council and the local community
4286904 they will get the chance to meet other young people and learn about group leadership
4286905 this year we stepped up our applications but we didnt expect to get the lot
4286906 who needs to know what we decided today how are we going to communicate this to them
4286907 initial applications to join the oss preliminary training and subsequent work assignments pay leave and travel documents evaluations basic medical information and awards decorations and discharge papers

4286909 there is an unconfirmed legend about one of the richest men in hong kong
4286910 the real question is can i run yet or not
4286911 your leg is too weak i want that it band to heal and i want you to strengthen your quads the harder you work at that the sooner youll be able to run
4286912 i think youve got the right plan j d adjusting your other
4286913 why do we focus so much attention on one place is
4286914 why are certain days considered holy can presence not be experienced at any time
4286915 persuade the russian government to end violence permanently and withdraw its troops from georgia
4286916 yes the gap is significantly lower this year than in years past
4286917 the gap between the american carmakers and the average import has closed to almost nothing if you look at the total corporations
4286918 but if you break it down by model there are also some categories where the u s models actually ranked ahead of the imports
4286919 these were mostly in the larger vehicle segments suvs minivans pick up trucks etc
4286920 i think what this says to consumers is that even if you buy blind without doing any research or reading any reviews and just make your choice based on styling or price you now have a much better chance of buying a higher quality vehicle or of avoiding a lower quality one
4286921 we work pretty closely with all of the manufacturers and we know that improving quality is something theyre always interested in improving
4286922 these kinds of quality improvements once consumers know about them can definitely contribute to their ability to recover
4286923 we see the effort that ford and the other automakers are putting into quality and they share our view that having a quality product is the price of entry into the market
4286924 you need to have quality vehicles in order to compete the u s carmakers are looking at quality as one of their main foundations in their turnaround plans which is good because without a quality product a companys reputation suffers which in turn means the company suffers financially
4286925 malibu was a good example of the americans closing the gap this year
4286926 that segment with the malibu camry fusion and accord is very very competitive
4286927 this shift in sales preferences among new vehicle buyers is in part a response to rapidly increasing fuel prices
4286928 the good news for consumers in this difficult environment is that they can downsize with confidence as there are many models with high initial quality in the smaller vehicle segments
4286929 and it will be particularly important for manufacturers to ensure high initial quality in these launches
4286930 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
4286931 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
4286932 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
4286933 i have this hokey named plan that is rather complicated wont achieve what i say it will will discourage people from working and make the tax code even more complicated vote for me
4286934 if something is working you should know it s working

4286944 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4286945 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4286946 if and when that happens then we will address it
4286947 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4286948 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4286949 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4286950 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4286951 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place
4286952 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
4286953 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4286954 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation

4286959 reware bags are proof that you can offer high quality american made environmentally conscious products at a reasonable price
4286960 were big fans of localization over globalization and work hard to support local producers and craftspeople to make products the average person can afford
4286961 reware brand bags are 100 guaranteed as post consumer and 100 made in the usa
4286962 many bags are sold as either recycled post consumer or made in the usa but unfortunately thats often not the case with reware bags youre getting the real thing
4286963 we use rewoven fabric in a production process that employs talented american craftspeople who make our products to exacting standards
4286964 were excited by the idea that you can indeed make not only high quality products in the u s but high quality environmentally conscious products
4286965 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4286966 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4286967 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4286968 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4286969 wrong headed short sighted fracture the democratic partys fracture right now
4286970 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4286971 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4286972 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4286973 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4286974 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4286975 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4286976 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the does not make him any less of a republican
4286977 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the
4286978 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4286979 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4286980 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4286981 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4286982 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4286983 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
4286984 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
4286985 fast and easy money but they are so on the edge of not maintaining their current demand its a disaster in the making
4286986 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
4286987 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
4286988 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
4286989 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
4286990 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
4286991 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten

4287001 we have more than 50 per cent more accidents than what queensland are having at their level crossings
4287002 we know that there are 1400 crossings across the state that only have stop signs and give way signs and the brumby government has been very slow to upgrade those crossings
4287003 the air conditioner guys are getting their jobs back they sweat so we stay cool
4287004 this thief is from the immigrant community and hes hitting the very people hes associated with

4287014 unless we get a substantial new lead or perhaps a new witness stepping forward or someone confesses to the crime it is highly unlikely that youll see the investigation reaching a successful conclusion in the sense of a criminal prosecution that leads to a conviction
4287015 that doesnt mean theres any less determination to solve it it means we need something new to investigate because what we currently have has been investigated to destruction
4287016 there was a feeling that those responsible were going to be caught very shortly i never thought i would be sitting talking about it 10 years after the event
4287017 and as far as justice is concerned were as far back as we were 10 years ago
4287018 people rightly expect that we will take whatever measures we can properly and legitimately to bring those responsible to justice
4287019 we will continue to try to bring the perpetrators to court and to lock them up for a very long time
4287020 i fully understand their frustration because i think its probably the same as my frustration
4287021 they had an absolute right to have that crime brought to justice in the traditional sense and put through the courts and to see the people who committed that atrocity locked up and literally the key thrown away
4287022 every year 70 000 students come into dublin for college and only between 6pc 8pc of these will find on campus accommodation
4287023 there is significant pressure on the private rental market at this time and the removal of bedsits adds to and compounds an already difficult situation
4287024 weve been inundated with calls from students asking about accommodation as have the unions in trinity and ucd there is a small window of opportunity for students particularly for first years to try to get a place
4287025 these standards must reflect the general quality of life improvements in ireland over the last 10 years
4287026 some of the worst accommodation that students had to live in were the bedsits particularly during the mid 1990s
4287027 there are a lot of people looking for rental accommodation
4287028 the mark of a humane society is how it protects its weaker members and i want to introduce a set of standards that will eliminate sub standard accommodation from the rental market
4287029 i think outlawing bedsits is absolutely a good move by moving into two or three room apartments students are living with others they are not living alone or in isolation
4287030 the department declined our request that the three women be kept on in their jobs
4287031 we are currently awaiting a response from the minster responsible mary hanafin in relation to the request
4287032 we are of the opinion that the department is in breach of regulations relating to the transfer of undertakings
4287033 i dont think this case will be solved overnight but we hope that something can be done

4287059 the 3g networking glitches may well be real but its worth pointing out that richard windsor is the same jackass who issued a report a year ago about the supposedly faulty
4287060 some users said they performed side by side tests and found that the iphone had connectivity problems in locations where 3g phones from other manufacturers did not the reports were made by users who said they lived in australia united states canada japan britain and other countries
4287061 windsor added that since he believes the problem to be embedded within the chipset itself its unlikely that apple can rectify the issue through software updates
4287062 im passionate about working with people in the bourke area and helping them make a positive difference to their lives
4287063 my main focus as an indigenous services officer is to inform and connect local indigenous communities with centrelink and to build on the strong relationship we have with the people here im working closely with the brewarrina local community at the moment and hope to visit the enngionia weilmoringle nyngan and cobar people in the near future
4287064 so far my time with centrelink has been fantastic it has been hard work but gratifying at the same time
4287065 im a local girl through and through so working with people in the area was a deciding factor for me in accepting the job
4287066 tina brings a bundle of experience to her new role and has been working hard to build her networks
4287067 she has been ensuring centrelink continues to work in line with the national indigenous employees plan indigenous service strategy and centrelinks reconciliation statement
4287068 tina has provided a fresh and enthusiastic face to centrelink in bourke and were glad to have her on board to help make a difference in the lives of the local indigenous people
4287069 copper theft is not only dangerous to thieves involved its also putting the publics life at risk too by shutting down power supplies trains and phone lines
4287070 this is an international problem spurred on by the spiralling cost of world copper prices which have more than doubled since 2004 todays price is around 8 a kilogram
4287071 new reports from the united kingdom and south africa for example have shown the widespread nature of the crime where police estimate the crime is costing the uk economy 360 million each year
4287072 the good news is our campaign is working there has been a reduction in copper theft in some areas due to the use of permanent dna tracing technology and weve had more arrests thanks to the publics support
4287073 but we need to continue in our efforts because people are still risking their lives to steal copper and its resulting in major costs and disruptions for the public
4287074 the nsw campaign has resulted in a 47 per cent reduction in the number of copper theft incidents at integral energy installations between march 2008 and july 2008 compared to the same period in 2007
4287075 recently in western sydney two men were arrested while trying to steal cable from an electrical substation thanks to a report from a member of the public
4287076 in nsw public utilities are using high tech surveillance and security measures to crackdown on copper theft
4287077 i want to acknowledge the work of the nsw utilities copper theft security committee for helping drive this national campaign including integral energy security manager graham courtney
4287078 we have been working with scrap metal dealers the construction industry and other businesses who have been helping us to stop this crime
4287079 people illegally trading in copper should be aware that copper can be traced by police either because it has been tagged with permanent tracing technology or because scrap metal dealers are now actively keeping a record of the source of all copper transactions
4287080 this helicopter has a longer range capability than the interim aircraft that it replaced
4287081 it will give customs the ability to fly longer surveillance missions and reach more remote locations if needed
4287082 the helicopter is the latest addition to the customs coastwatch fleet which helps to protect our northern borders from threats such as illegal foreign fishing people drug and weapon smugglers and quarantine and environmental risks
4287083 rirdc has a focus on diversification and new industry development as well as on ensuring competitiveness and sustainability in a range of established industries
4287084 the corporation a partnership between rural industries and the australian government also manages r amp d cross issues of national importance such as farm health and safety rural leadership development international trade and biofuels
4287085 our investments are driven by five year r amp d plans which address the needs of each industry and ensure our priorities are industry and government driven if you think you or your organisation can help address the needs of our programs as outlined on our website we would welcome your application for funding
4287086 rirdc welcomes proposals that will meet the specific objectives or a number of objectives of each program and we also encourage collaboration with other research providers to build the critical research mass necessary to meet our objectives
4287087 our new industries portfolio covers a range of emerging industries from crocodiles and alpacas through to olives essential oils and biofuels
4287088 all of these new industries have benefited from innovation funded through rirdcs new industries r amp d rograms
4287089 we also target productivity and profitability in our suite of established industries including chicken meat rice horses and honey
4287090 each of these industries has continuing r amp d needs and we are looking for organizations that can help us meet those needs
4287091 this project aims to provide employees at john hollands lytton site with the fundamental skills that will help them gain confidence and boost their skill levels
4287092 the program combines english language literacy and numeracy training with a business services and metal and engineering training
4287093 investment in the education skills and training of people is the single most important thing that can be done to lift australias productivity
4287094 the training is also designed to help workers meet their current and future employment and training needs
4287095 the strategy will have a particular focus on training opportunities for people who want to work in the aged care and associated health sectors
4287096 there will be opportunities in aged care disability work community development horticulture carpentry business management asset management hospitality and allied health
4287097 aged care and associated services are growing and the australian government wants indigenous australians to share in the employment opportunities that will flow from that
4287098 this project will assist in raising employment levels in cape york and communities will benefit from the lasting effects of the strategy
4287099 significant shortages of skilled labour currently exist in the regions in australia where mining operations are undertaken
4287100 at the same time there are often significant numbers of indigenous job seekers in these regions this program not only provides training but also helps job seekers secure employment once they have completed their training
4287101 the mobile mining school pilot is an innovative way to bring industry and job seekers together and if successful the concept could be expanded to service regional areas in the northern territory and western australia
4287102 several major mining companies have already expressed strong interest in this trial and in employing graduates of the project
4287103 the new national quality framework needs to be ambitious comprehensive and easy to understand said ms mckew
4287104 i hope parents operators educators and anyone with an interest in early childhood development will attend these consultations and give us their feedback on what they think the new framework should look like
4287105 this was the first time weve successfully gotten a bee colony out of a meter box
4287106 the only other time we had one the owner wouldnt let us onto her property
4287107 if they cant find a tree theyll find whatever they can
4287108 meter boxes are the low rent district theyd much prefer a high rise
4287109 it is a real pleasure to announce more than 37 million in funds at kurruru who themselves will receive more than 105 000 under the indigenous culture support program and meet with and experience the work of these young dance students
4287110 all australians will enjoy the cultural benefits which will flow from the projects that receive these funds the dance festivals music television and radio productions the art and crafts and the revival and strengthening of our indigenous languages
4287111 for many indigenous communities these arts broadcasting language and cultural activities are their lifeblood generating economic benefits showcasing the skills of indigenous artists and performers and keeping communities connected
4287112 the funding being announced today will ensure community arts centres continue to play that important role
4287113 in the same way the 14 million were announcing for the indigenous broadcasting program recognises how essential these services are in helping people stay connected with their families culture and communities as well as providing security for people living in remote communities
4287114 i note that for the first time asics recommendations to asx are presented as agreed actions this shows a concerted effort by both asic and asx to quicken their response times to emerging issues in financial markets and i welcome this
4287115 financial markets have experienced a significant turnaround this year and regulators have done a solid job in difficult times a well funded and transparent approach to market supervision is a critical component of a well ordered market
4287116 home packages help older australians continue to live in their own homes and remain independent and active
4287117 the australian government is significantly increasing the level of assistance provided to older australians and their families
4287118 the number of each packages grew by 28 per cent to 3 302 operational packages while the new each dementia packages doubled from 600 to nearly 1 300
4287119 the report also found some interesting trends in demographics with women making up the majority of care recipients 71 per cent for the cacp program
4287120 cacp recipients were also the oldest profile with 65 per cent 80 years and over compared with each recipients who were a younger demographic
4287121 by the end of 2006 07 the combined total for cacps each and each dementia packages was 21 8 packages per 1 000 australians 70 years and over which the government plans to increase to 25 per 1 000 by 2010 11
4287122 it can either act as a barrier or a stimulus
4287123 i cant think of a block that has more opportunities all we can do there now is park cars and we cant even do that very well
4287124 we recently identified that the extensive pollution haze emanating from asia may be re shaping rainfall patterns and monsoonal winds in northern australia establishing the impacts of aerosols across the rest of the country presents a new research challenge
4287125 to better model climate variability and climate change in the australian region more research is needed into aerosol sources their atmospheric distributions and how to incorporate these processes robustly in global climate models
4287126 evidence of this is found in recent csiro climate modelling which shows that the asian aerosol haze affects temperature gradients between asia and australia and may have caused an increase in rainfall over north western australia
4287127 global ocean circulation provides another mechanism whereby aerosol changes in the northern hemisphere can affect climate in the southern hemisphere suggesting an urgent need for further targeted studies using coupled ocean atmosphere global climate models
4287128 in recent weeks we had our first indication from csiros climate model that australian sourced aerosols actively influence australian climate and rainfall
4287129 the scale of the collections is enormous and continues to grow as scientists discover new species
4287130 the australian national herbarium has more than 1 4 million specimens some of which were collected by sir joseph banks on his voyage with captain cook in 1770
4287131 even bigger is our australian national insect collection which has over 12 million specimens and is the worlds largest collection of australian insects and related groups such as mites spiders worms and centipedes
4287132 information from the collections is available and used in a variety of ways for example to support revegetation efforts
4287133 we are really excited to be able to show people just some of the best of these amazing collections and to meet the people looking after them and see how specimens are collected stored and used
4287134 in fact the csa has 770 separated parents registered in the katherine area
4287135 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns face to face with a csa customer service officer
4287136 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
4287137 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
4287138 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
4287139 festivals like this are a great opportunity for amateur film makers like myself to have our films screened to a wide audience
4287140 the film really shows whats at stake for this magnificent creature
4287141 we are committed to reducing crashes on top end roads
4287142 thats why the black spot program is a vital element in the governments plan to improve road safety it targets roads that either have a history of crashes or a significant risk of crashes occurring
4287143 accidents take a huge toll on families our community and the territory economy
4287144 the black spot program complements the funding that i have already secured for major national infrastructure links in the territory like tiger brennan drive and the stuart highway
4287145 this is about improving road safety at both the national and local level
4287146 from next year 2009 10 the rudd government will deliver on its election commitment to increase black spot funding by a massive 33 per cent next year up to a record 60 million nationally
4287147 the program has a proven track record of saving lives at least 32 deaths and more than 1 500 serious injuries were prevented as a result of the program in three years an evaluation by the bureau of infrastructure transport and regional economics has shown
4287148 for every 1 spent on fixing black spots around 14 is returned to the community through a reduction in the number and cost of crashes
4287149 these projects were assessed and recommended by a panel of independent road safety experts they included the australian trucking association of nt local government association of nt automobile association of nt office of indigenous policy and the department of infrastructure planning and environment
4287150 in fact the csa has more than 6857 separated parents registered within the mirrabooka area
4287151 in areas where there is no csa office these personal appointments give separated parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
4287152 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
4287153 its important for separated parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support

4287155 i thought mungo in western nsw was a wonder because of the interesting geography and landscape there and because its one of the oldest traces of ritual burial in australia
4287156 i am pleased that we will be able to make a longer stretch of the highway safer both for local families and trucks carrying freight between the riverland and adelaide
4287157 i congratulate the south australian government for good project management in delivering extra kilometres of double lane road within the original budget
4287158 the rudd labor governments funding for this project builds on our 451 million commitments to the northern and port river expressways all up we will invest 1 1 billion over the next five years improving the states roads
4287159 this is one of our major freight routes and is a key part of the overall network and our significant investment in strategically upgrading it
4287160 following the recent opening of the port river expressway bridges an extension to the sturt highway further strengthens that network
4287161 in the next two years the northern expressway will take shape and all the parts of the puzzle will come together to ensure south australia remains as competitive as possible when it comes to serving the export market
4287162 it is important that we all recognise the efforts that these award recipients have gone to on their path to gaining a place at adfa
4287163 this year defence force recruiting dfr has been working through over 1 200 applications so the competition is quite strong
4287164 this is the first recognition for these young people in what will im sure be one of the best things they can do in their careers

4287176 what about the security concerns of the protesters they want to secure the bill of rights they want to secure peace and an end to foreign occupations they want to secure themselves from arrest for bullsh t crimes i guess these are the rare cases where the freedom to tyranize trumps security
4287177 this war now belongs to the democrats no less than the republicans if it is left to mccain and obama the occupation will continue for years it was wrong to go into iraq its wrong to stay in iraq its wrong not to get out now if there is not a strong showing from the anti war movement against this whole direction outside the convention it will signal those who make war and the victims of these wars around the world that the people of this country will go along with continued occupation with mccain or obama sending many more troops to afghanistan and with threats to iran the bush regime promised a war to last generations are we against this or not the anti war movement must set a standard of resistance not accommodate what is intolerable only the people not the politicians can force open debate over why the u s occupation must end now only we can act on our convictions letting others know that an end to the illegal unjust and immoral wars and occupations will not happen without massive mobilization of the people and that putting all your hopes and energies into the elections will not bring the change millions desire
4287178 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
4287179 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction

4287219 the us did play a role in the war transporting almost 1000 georgian troops from iraq directly to the battle front

4287222 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among pre school children
4287223 the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4287224 there may well be some other common factor in obesity

4287230 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4287231 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole
4287232 new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce

4287238 hundreds of white moths whirling inside the columns of illuminated air
4287239 their wings flapping desperately as if feeding on the light
4287240 but i know we owe it to the voters to present them with what the vision for a merged system would be
4287241 there are probably a lot more questions than answers right now
4287242 but i agree that it would be very helpful to let the voters know what type of system they may be getting
4287243 my personal preference is it would have been nice to have been meeting by now
4287244 but were not out of time we still have time to talk

4287246 they would put a cross on the ground and demand that people step on it one after another those that didnt were sent to labor camps and were later sometimes even killed

4287261 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4287262 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time

4287272 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4287274 her helmet saved her from more serious injury the whole front of it was smashed to smithereens
4287275 the door was only opened 10cm and shes just caught the edge

4287560 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4287561 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4287562 it started as a gamble by georgia the former soviet republic and darling of the west move quickly into the breakaway pro russian enclave called south ossetia and take back what is legally georgias but the plan failed instead russian forces invaded georgia last week and crushed georgian resistance according to u s military officials russia is out to decimate the u s trained georgian armed forces
4287563 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4287564 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4287565 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4287566 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4287567 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4287568 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4287569 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4287570 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4287571 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4287572 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty

4287574 with only about 400 fully qualified interpreters in england to support approximately 70 000 deaf people who use bsl as their first language it can be a real challenge arranging a supported doctors appointment
4287575 by funding signtranslate to be free for every gp in england we hope that every deaf person will be able to see their doctor when they need to they will attend the consultation with the knowledge that the signtranslate program will assist communication and additionally provide on line interpretation
4287576 we are delighted to work with signtranslate to increase the reach of this innovative service
4287577 it will help practices to improve access for not only deaf patients but also those who dont have english as a first language the years free funding will be a major incentive for gps to use the service
4287578 we expect you to abide by the terms and conditions of your permit if the conditions stipulate your limits clearly but you go beyond them you would definitely be breaching the law everyone is bound to follow the terms and condition of their licence

4287582 it looks like the price of oil is coming down hence the hope of reducing the price of petrol god willing
4287583 every end of the month is the time that we will decide on the price of petrol as i have said before
4287584 god willing there will be a reduction but once again this depends on world oil prices falling or reaching a lower level and not going up again
4287585 based on that we have taken another step to strengthen ties in defence matters
4287586 we will also discuss outstanding maritime issues with them for instance they have asked malaysian authorities to refrain from firing warning shots at their fishermen who encroach on our waters

4287593 but what did he do in the end he dumped us and joined umno
4287594 we pas have bigger challenges ahead but our struggles and principles are being compromised by the other two parties pkr and dap
4287595 does that mean we have to be sensitive to their needs and keep quiet just because we are in a marriage
4287596 we are giving a warning now pas will not be bullied in our quest to champion the islamic struggle
4287597 they even have the gall to tell him not to talk about it
4287598 we have our own president who is more qualified and yet they want anwar is it because they are so taken up by his claim of forming the government on sept 16
4287599 what is our partys obsession with anwar anyway even in our own party organ harakah there is more news about anwar than about our own leaders

4287605 we actually took the initiative to locate the son and to try to get him to see his dad for the last time
4287606 they are some heart touching moments in the series that makes it all the more a great show to catch
4287607 im the flamboyant rich kid who takes women for granted
4287608 im totally the opposite of the character i play in the series at first it was difficult to get into my role as im a shy and reserved person and i definitely didnt belong in the flirty category
4287609 my first scene was getting out of bed with a girl beside me it was quite the scene to start off from well now i roughly know whats it like to be a player
4287610 the show is not just about doctors and their lives but its also about friendship family values love and tragedies that we all go through together
4287611 many people were in need of motivation and self development
4287612 right from our great grandparents to our grandparents to our parents negative parenting happens because they didnt know any better do we want to pass that on to our children ask yourself what is the legacy you leave your children what are the values you want them to remember
4287613 blame is the most horrible and self defeating trait in a person this attitude will only drag you down
4287614 blaming is ridiculous whether in business marriage or relationships you need to be responsible for every aspect of your life stop taking things personally instead be respectful and sensitive to each other
4287615 i realised that there were many unhappy employees in any given organisation and this programme will identify and get to the root of the problem
4287616 kembali is a very significant album for the band it marks our departure from the dark and gloomy side portrayed in selamat tinggal dunia
4287617 these major labels they hardly do anything for you i guess there will always be that love hate relationship with them
4287618 we are happy people now compared to the years when we started loque who was away in the united states at the time of the interview is head over heels in love and i have a family there is nothing to be frustrated about
4287619 we do not want to be compared to any band because we have created our own sound this is us
4287620 there were mixed reactions when we first released 1 000 tahun mahu hidup people had high expectations of us to deliver heavy and powerful chords but the song shows the progression of the band to a sound we can call our own
4287621 it is a solid album when we were younger our songs were done in a rush pretty impromptu but kembali shows the bands maturity in terms of music and friendship
4287622 we have never been really merdeka we even started to sound like them
4287623 we are lacking support from the government and society we hope we can give the industry a little lift with our return
4287624 if the album thrives that will be great if it sinks then it shows that good music equals failure
4287625 people dont appreciate music as a form of art they see it as an industry some are in it for fame rather than for the music
4287626 younger bands are very business minded they know where they are heading and how to earn money we lost a lot of time figuring out the industry we were less fortunate than this generation
4287627 music wise there is a lot of improvement equipment is better and bands are taking advantage of it to create good music
4287628 we like them they are bands that have a great future ahead
4287629 we dont want to get all frustrated with the music scene we just want to play our music
4287630 as long as we can play our music that justifies butterfingers cause to be here

4287635 the wife of televangelist joel osteen thanked and praised god after a jury unanimously decided thursday that she did not assault a flight attendant during an alleged tirade over a stain on her first class seat
4287636 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4287637 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4287638 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4287639 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4287640 it was the strangest thing ive ever seen they looked as if they were on fire really bright orange orbs we spotted eight or nine go over my house between 10 and 11pm
4287641 they definitely werent helicopters or planes or anything like that and there was no smoke or sound
4287642 by the end there were about eight people out in the close watching them go by my neighbour said shed seen them as she was leaving the trafford centre
4287643 these things were massive the first one i saw was just below the cloud line but the others were probably only about 300ft up
4287644 i took some pictures and video but i couldnt really seem to capture the size of them just a bit in the middle like the filament of a light bulb
4287645 id just returned home and we caught sight of one through the trees it went over one of the houses and was still for a while before slowly fading away
4287646 just as it was disappearing another one came again from the same direction it wasnt something we imagined
4287647 i dont really believe in flying saucers but they were huge bright orange spheres
4287648 they were lower than a plane but higher than a helicopter
4287649 i was saying oh my god because it was so strange

4287653 we reduced the scale and created the rhythm of the columns with the piano keys on top with the little blue lights at night
4287654 we have to do that in order to understand how the facade these precast panels you see in the roof will respond to wind loading
4287655 its not gonna be like a concert hall in terms of absorbing noise i think the fans will like the amount of reverberation it has
4287656 from my standpoint it is the best stadium that we have done with our firm

4287669 i dont think its that hes doing better than expected i think its that obama is doing worse than he would expect

4287671 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4287672 of course i was thankful about the events in berlin
4287673 but as i answered questions my mind kept racing over a possible soviet crackdown turning all the happiness to tragedy my answers were cautious i tried to explain that we were handling the event in a way that would not goad the soviets

4287689 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4287690 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4287696 the birds have to make a judgment do they expend most of their energy flying long distances to the uk where they know the winters are likely to be mild and where they will find food or do they save energy take a shorter journey but then risk their food supply running out
4287697 these are the choices forced on them by climate change
4287698 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4287699 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4287700 the consistent declines in specialist bird species highlighted by this years report indicate that the variety and richness of our countryside is being lost

4287745 god and the church arent the same thing the church has gotten this and many other things wrong god hasnt gotten it wrong
4287746 the beauty of anglicanism is that we are not a church that believes god stopped revealing himself at the end of the first century when the canon of scripture was closed

4287834 i hope you dig what we do to improve things around here with the help and input from our webmasters our sls and you
4287835 so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
4287836 involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now
4287837 i think we can do more and we should do more
4287838 these results are going to move their country forward and we have to learn how better to provide support for our athletes
4287839 we have to have a good hard look at how we fund our athletes our coaches our nutritionists lets get on with doing something its critical
4287840 who knows how many youngsters will start swimming because of michael phelps or 2007 world champion from b c brent hayden
4287841 yes you need to fund the foundation and you need to build from the ground up but you need to fund worthwhile elite athletes as well we have to invest in the athlete
4287842 but we can do more to help them attain their absolute best
4287843 i wasnt that good at any of them but i played
4287844 were coming up on the back half of the games
4287845 so well remain optimistic and of course well cheer for everybody who wears the maple leaf
4287846 were doing nothing different than you did in kosovo or bosnia
4287847 the russian monk philoteus filofey in 1510 to their son grand duke vasili iii which proclaimed

4287855 i am really beginning to like reading the mad pigeon i like his take on topics
4287856 this blog instantly caught my eye not because he had a fancy design but because i really liked the content
4287857 its time for a new blog of the time period todays candidate is the mad pigeon im not going to tell you anything about it but trust me youll like it
4287858 i for one regard your blog as one of my daily must reads
4287859 ive yet to read a post of yours that hasnt made me smile think or at least amuse me
4287860 thanks again for keeping us all up to date on popular culture
4287861 you seriously have to be the funniest pigeon ive ever seen flying feathers mad pigeon rules the coop
4287862 just in case i havent mentioned it i think you are bloody brilliant i love your site and i really love your take on things even when i may not agree
4287863 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
4287864 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
4287865 the new ka is the perfect match for the character of camille adventurous individual and thoroughly modern
4287866 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe
4287867 when i come home at night im not the most powerful person in my house
4287868 players are in the mood to play against somebody else
4287869 im still under contract at miami he needs to come up with a better one than that
4287870 got a little better players than we have right now but weve just got to keep working at it
4287871 i think ill be a little bit better in that aspect
4287872 i think the odor would be one that you would notice first you might not notice the quality of water until someone tested the water but its pretty hard to measure smell until it happens and when it does its bad
4287873 we hope to convince them not to approve it hopefully theyll use the degradation of the air quality as a good reason not to because it stands to reason the air will be degraded
4287874 it was a good physical go and both sides got after it
4287875 both sides did some good things and both sides have a lot to fix
4287876 its that time of camp when theyre sore theyre tired they came out here and got after each other
4287877 were going to put the best guys out there that are going to be able to play winning football for us wed like to hopefully have enough depth that we dont have to use starters throughout all those units but if you have to you have to that depends on the guys that are the 2s and 3s were looking for guys were trying to establish some depth
4287878 to speak personally the very reason i write is so that i might not sleepwalk through my entire life
4287879 i write entirely to find out what im thinking what im looking at what i see and what it means what i want and what i fear
4287880 to live with the bible is more like living with a multi generational extended family than with a crotchety grandfather who keeps telling us of the good old days
4287881 if i was asked today which group has improved the most i would say the offensive line which is encouraging
4287882 i may feel differently saturday because that is a work in progress if they take one step back then we are in trouble they have truly as a unit been the most improved
4287883 when we are consistent up front we have been really good i think greg akinbiyi has really shown up and moved himself into first team status brandon harper showed up in the scrimmage on tuesday we would like to get to the point where we have 5 7 capable starters
4287884 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
4287885 young people are sympathizing because they see themselves and todays situation today in the novel
4287886 the sympathy is sporadic and i dont think it will lead to organized movements
4287887 things are different now from the stable employment conditions of japans period of high economic growth
4287888 life time employment is gone and its uncertain whether people will receive their pensions
4287889 the novels like a dream everyone uniting fighting and winning together
4287890 but i doubt well see that type of reaction now
4287891 society today is too diverse so there isnt one thing that people can bond over
4287892 it isnt as simple as it was in the novel
4287893 we never missed a payment we had insurance for one reason and one reason only that was to protect our property
4287894 we just want to be fairly compensated for what we lost
4287895 were not looking for pain and suffering even though this is the hardest thing weve ever been through we just want to get back exactly what we put into it and start our lives over
4287896 is not even in print at the time it is offered
4287897 the house is burning down and the president of the united states says this is the way to put out the fire applause and to me at this time there is only one answer to this question and that is to give the president what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation
4287898 no man outside of a lunatic asylum will loan his money today on a farm mortgage
4287899 there is no limitation upon the power of congress it is not circumscribed in any respect whatever it is given full and plenary power to deal with that subject and therefore it is the same as if there were no constitution whatever
4287900 with the full understanding that the government may change its monetary policy at any time and that he must accept whatever the congress says at a particular time shall constitute money
4287901 coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures
4287902 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4287903 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4287904 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4287905 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4287906 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4287907 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4287908 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans

4287914 were worried at this point were in jeopardy of reducing some of our programs
4287915 its a rough time for everyone and the salvation army just wants to be able to provide services for those most in need
4287916 the economy is really bad right now everyone is hurting but if i can help someone im willing to help them
4287917 lets give nbc all our money for another season of the single guy
4287918 well its interesting but is it relevant dont we have bigger things to worry about with the economy and iraq and russia and all the rest
4287919 a 1 micron particle cant be seen in the optical microscope we selected an area on the substrate using the optical microscope that was clear of debris and other clumps of material
4287920 we went in with afm to see where we saw nothing
4287921 it has been 12 years figuring out how we would get this dust particle image when we couldnt even see them

4287926 we are pleased that dosing has been completed in the second study for our azx100 phase 1 human clinical trial program in dermal scarring
4287927 the goal of this program for azx100 is to develop a safe and effective medication for an unmet market need we had previously stated this phase 1b study would begin during third quarter 2008 and with this announcement it should be clear we are on track with our announced timelines assuming successful completion of this second phase 1 safety study we anticipate initiating phase 2 efficacy studies in this indication early in 2009

4287940 cameroonian president paul biya looks forward to new reliable and mutually beneficial relationship between cameroon and nigeria
4287941 it is a day of triumph for the rule of law which lies at the very core of the values of the un
4287942 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community to advance international peace and cooperation and advance the cause of african brotherhood and good neighbourliness
4287943 every arrangement to fully integrate all those who remain in their ancestral home
4287944 it leaves room for some hope for other existing border differences where there are large amounts of natural riches
4287945 guarantees the rights and the protection of the bakassi people
4287946 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4287947 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4287948 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4287949 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4287950 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4287951 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4287952 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4287953 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4287954 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4287955 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4287956 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4287960 kids will be ready to go for the start of school
4287961 we are trying to build up our applicant pool so we have more people on our state registers where we can hire from
4287962 we know we put people behind bars for breaking the law you have to have folks that are studying the crime to put the individuals behind bars and we have a significant backlog in that regard
4287963 i wont say crime running rampant but certainly you dont have enough folks to deal with the crime that is happening
4287964 quite shocking i mean its a surprise i didnt expect to have to be able to move so soon says tyree
4287965 the seeds of russias aggression lie in the sense of humiliation that moscows proud power elites have felt at the hands of the west going back to the clinton administrations unceasing efforts to bring what used to be the soviet bloc and post soviet russia itself into the wests sphere of influence
4287966 if all goes according to plan google should be in the black in less than 24 months if page and brin pull it off now that will be some story to tell
4287967 theres a large ultimately a large monetary investment that they have to go through
4287968 through insurance and fines and i think they just need to realize theres a lot more that follows its a lot cheaper to have designated driver or to take a taxi cab
4287969 i really think that ordinance violation on the first offense is just from the start sending the wrong message
4287970 we arrest a lot of drunk drivers in this state
4287971 however were barely scratching the surface we cant do this alone we need help and need it desperately
4287972 today i call on the wisconsin legislature to move forward on legislation requiring ignition interlock devices for all convicted drunk drivers
4287973 the purpose of that is to prevent your buddy from blowing into it or leaving it idle at a tavern
4287974 were friends i havent stopped being his friend if he asks me id give it to him
4287975 we have leaders who are doing too much whining and not enough leading i never apologize for telling the truth
4287976 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4287977 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4287978 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4287979 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4287980 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4287981 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4287982 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4287983 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4287984 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4287985 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
4287986 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4287987 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4287988 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4287989 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4287990 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4287991 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4287992 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4287993 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4287994 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4287995 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4287996 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4287997 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4287998 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4287999 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4288000 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4288001 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4288002 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4288003 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4288004 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4288005 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4288006 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4288007 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4288008 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4288010 when you have kids you disappear off to baby land
4288011 thats a lovely comfy place to be but you can also drown in it i loved baby land i loved spending all day staring at my girls as babies but you have to do something for yourself as well
4288012 i used to think that sounded dead selfish but its not its what keeps you sane i didnt do the last series of waterloo road because i was pregnant it will be really nice to go back but double full on too
4288013 its really attractive and hes still a bloke about it all jason is very comfortable in his own skin i honestly think hes absolutely perfect so i worry ill find out one day hes actually a mass murderer
4288014 his one fault is he cleans the house too much which youve got to love
4288015 some people want to stay at home with the kids and cant think of anything worse than going back to work
4288016 other friends work six days a week and see the kids at the weekend and love that its finding what works for you

4288020 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4288021 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4288022 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4288023 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4288024 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4288025 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
4288026 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
4288027 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
4288028 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4288029 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4288030 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4288031 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4288032 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4288033 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4288034 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4288035 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4288036 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4288037 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
4288038 its hard to be any worse than we were last year
4288039 we only can go up from there were bringing in good talent and weve got guys in the program now that are going to help us win
4288040 i think i understand the job and exactly what it entails i think we all understand each other players and coaches and so i think thats the exciting thing for me the reason why i feel really good and i feel calm is that these kids have worked so hard and when you match hard work with talent good things are going to happen
4288041 we needed to add more guys in the secondary but we really think that weve created some competitive situations that are going to help us
4288042 we cant walk in here feeling sorry for ourselves because we were 1 11 last year were a brand new team we need swagger we need to walk into that stadium knowing were going to win knowing were going to be a tough team
4288043 you can hear him talk a lot and you can understand where hes going but it takes a little bit to really build into what hes doing
4288044 now i think its a lot easier for us because we know what he does we know what he has to offer were just excited to kind of see what hes going to bring this year and how hes going to keep going with us
4288045 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4288046 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4288047 actor was cited july 25 for carrying the unloaded concealed weapon at the las vegas airport phone messages left for marghilano were not immediately returned thursday celeb watch
4288048 in the last 18 months i would say the number of inquiries associated with fuel cell based applications is 10 to 15 times more than it used to be
4288049 we are working with pretty much every major wireless operator either on a first office application a trial site or large network based rfqs requests for quotation throughout systems
4288050 the fuel is compressed hydrogen cylinders would last anywhere from three to nine months without a refill requirement
4288051 now we have a little more time to make our case as to why we think its unbearable on a lot of fronts
4288052 part of our belief is that its not within the jurisdiction of the fcc it cannot regulate on an issue such as backup power we also challenge it on terms of impracticality
4288053 it could be very expensive as well but the primary concern is impracticality
4288054 lead acid batteries are a very popular source but were talking about a ton and a half these are not double a batteries we put in our flashlights these are big batteries
4288055 do you really want to shoot it up through six floors of a building
4288056 at the time ibms outlook came out it looked like a bit of a stretch
4288057 but since then theyve produced strong results now theres a fair shot they might exceed their goal
4288058 our thinking is that our job is to make money for investors and return it to them
4288059 today we get 60 of our revenue growth from the established markets
4288060 but five years out we expect 60 of our growth to come from
4288061 a lot of the low hanging fruit has already been bought
4288062 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4288063 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4288064 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4288065 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4288066 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4288067 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4288068 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4288069 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4288070 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4288071 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4288072 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4288073 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4288074 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4288075 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4288076 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4288077 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4288078 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4288079 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4288080 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4288081 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4288082 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4288083 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4288084 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4288085 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4288086 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4288087 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4288088 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4288089 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4288090 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4288091 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4288092 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4288093 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4288101 theyve been doing water collection and all the waste from vendors is composted and that compost goes toward organic gardens and shrubbery all year round
4288102 if and when that happens then we will address it
4288103 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4288104 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4288105 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4288106 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4288107 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place

4288119 its practically impossible to look at a penguin and feel angry
4288120 because their legs are set so low down on their bodies penguins stand upright and perhaps it is this similarity to ourselves that makes penguins so attractive to people
4288121 it will be a loneky knee high black and white penguin waddling up the snow covered beach that will steal your heart
4288122 i often have the impression that to penguins man is just another penguin different less predictable occasionally violent but tolerable company when he sits still and minds his own business

4288290 discriminatory violations of the human rights of ethnic georgians including attacks against civilians murder forced displacement denial of humanitarian assistance
4288291 we need to make sure that georgias transportation infrastructure is open is not restricted by russian ships in the black sea or russian armour in poti port or near gori
4288292 its just bizarre that naval forces are blockading a sovereign independent country
4288293 i cant imagine how anyone who is sane could think that could be acceptable or reasonable
4288294 i cant imagine how there could be any russian peacekeepers in the conflict zones
4288295 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4288296 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4288297 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon

4288327 society wannabes are the kinds of people who want to be on the list they desperately want to be taken seriously
4288328 there were people who just really objected to it found it invasive and were unhappy that we listed where they lived or the names of their kids or put up satellite imagery of their house in the hamptons

4288346 the vans barely keep up at eight miles to the gallon but we need vehicles that can handle wheelchairs

4288353 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4288354 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4288355 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4288356 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4288357 the birds have to make a judgment do they expend most of their energy flying long distances to the uk where they know the winters are likely to be mild and where they will find food or do they save energy take a shorter journey but then risk their food supply running out
4288358 these are the choices forced on them by climate change
4288359 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4288360 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4288361 the consistent declines in specialist bird species highlighted by this years report indicate that the variety and richness of our countryside is being lost
4288362 we urgently need to act to reverse the loss and fragmentation of important habitats if our wildlife is to stand any chance of adapting to climate change
4288363 they appear to be breeding earlier across a number of sites and the worry is they may eventually breed so early they are out of sync with their major food source of caterpillars

4288375 your friend is one of the luckiest people i have ever seen in the twenty five years ive been practicing medicine
4288376 her wounds were so severe she could have severed her hands had they been deeper due to the blood loss she sustained we had to give her several transfusions in the operating room i have to let you know that when the medics were en route here with her her heart stopped
4288377 they were able to shock her and revive her luckily
4288378 in re attaching all of the blood vessels in her wrists including the main arteries which proved difficult because they were both shredded almost beyond repair both wounds were also cleaned thoroughly before they were finally closed what did she use to make such horrendous cuts may i ask
4288379 a piece of glass from a mirror in her room
4288380 my fianc e and i heard her break it she had locked herself in her bathroom so i had to break the door down that was when we found her barricaded between the toilet and the bathtub
4288381 i wouldve never believed that such a petite girl could bleed that much it was like a murder scene in that bathroom
4288382 if she had been brought here any later we would not have been able to save her the heavy bleeding would have killed her somebody up there
4288383 was definitely watching out for that young lady if you ask me
4288384 he was killed less than a week ago in a motorcycle accident we buried him earlier today and she hasnt been right since so i think you might be right doc
4288385 i think i remember him his name was james wasnt it
4288386 i was here that night when they brought him in
4288387 damn shame both of them so young its so tragic at least we saved her though im very sorry i couldnt do more for james he was gone before he even got here he was pronounced at the scene if i remember correctly
4288388 but shell make a full recovery shes in the recovery room now and then shell be moved to a room in intensive care shes going to be extremely groggy from the anesthesia and the pain medicine we gave her plus we gave her something to help her sleep the poor child looks like she hadnt slept in a month
4288389 shell have scars but with time theyll be barely noticeable shell be admitted for at least five days just to make sure her wounds dont become infected im even going to have a grief counselor come in a couple of days to talk to her after shes more rested and relaxed do any of you have any questions for me
4288390 are you going to tell jeannie that you were the doctor that tried to save james the night he died
4288391 i was planning on telling her in a couple of days yes
4288392 shed be grateful to know that you saved her and also tried to save her fianc e it would comfort her to know that
4288393 but for right now i want her to stay calm and focus on healing because its going to take some time im afraid telling her too soon will upset her god only knows her emotional well being is just as important as her physical well being right now if not more so shes been through hell this past week
4288394 you have no idea how grateful we are for everything if james were still here hed thank you too
4288395 you guys go on home and get some rest yall have had a long day and i promise all of you that jeannies in the best of hands i have a daughter close her age so ill be keeping a very close eye on her you guys can come back tomorrow morning and see her shes even luckier to have such caring friends
4288396 you did nothing wrong baby girl we all know how much you loved james you have
4288397 thank you so much for telling me i cant believe i did something so stupid thank you for trying to save james you did everything you could for him given the circumstances ill always be grateful to you for that

4288399 the essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity need for admiration and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts
4288400 individuals with npd routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments often appearing boastful and pretentious they may blithely assume others attribute the same value to their efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not forthcoming

4288402 i know the way joe is so i shouldnt have let it bother me so much
4288403 why do you bother talking about that its in the past

4288446 that is not to say that there may not be one the investigation is ongoing we havent pinpointed anything
4288447 it is policy that all our firefighters dont talk to the media
4288448 depending on the skill level of investigators and what was left at the scene can change the results you have to put a lot together to reach conclusions
4288449 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold

4288457 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4288458 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4288459 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4288460 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place

4288468 i was taking photos from my window seat of clouds and i was wearing a noise reduction headset with a tv show playing loudly in my ears
4288469 even with the headset on i had been able to hear a very loud child seated a few rows in front of me annoying everyone for approximately two hours
4288470 i realized that the man seated next to the loud child had finally lost it
4288471 on instinct i turned my video camera towards the altercation
4288472 after viewing the video they demanded that i delete it

4288475 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4288476 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4288477 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4288478 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4288479 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4288480 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4288481 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4288482 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4288483 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4288484 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4288485 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4288486 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4288487 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil

4288707 he looks the same because everyone out here is kind of tired and beat up right now physically and mentally
4288708 so we dont even notice it maybe someone that comes in here with fresh legs would notice it but none of us do
4288709 he looks like brett and all that aura around him and how he throws the ball thats all true hes looking great and i just know that hes played for so long and knows how to take care of his body whenever one comes my way i just try to catch what i can
4288710 i think he sees the play but sometimes it doesnt come off his tongue maybe as fast as he wants it to because hes doing it one way for a long time but you definitely see him making strides
4288711 before when you had to repeat it two or three times now you do it one time and he looks at you and goes yeah ive got that
4288712 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4288713 hes always had a good feel for solving problems he might not be able to put it in our terminology but he knows ive got a problem over there and im going to bail myself out over here thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that when youre dealing with a smart guy who has played as much as he has theres really not much he hasnt seen
4288714 de aceea voi urma propriul drum nu in cautarea unei alte sau mai bune doctrine caci stiu ca ea nu exista ci pentru a abandona toate doctrinele si pe toti maestrii ca sa imi ating singur tinta

4288718 i dont think its too serious coach tony dungy said
4288719 he was a lot better at the end of practice
4288720 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4288721 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4288722 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4288723 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4288724 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4288725 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan
4288726 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4288727 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4288728 the people were saying why didnt he pitch against sabathia
4288729 sheets is every bit of what sabathia is this guy started the all star game a matchup like that is what a competitor loves to do
4288730 absolutely i did get upset a little bit it did give me some motivation
4288731 what a big day for the guys to come back and beat a guy like ben sheets especially after hes been so dominant
4288732 any time you match up with somebody like that you know runs are going to be at a premium those are fun days and days youre not going to forget
4288733 they both know that they are elite pitchers and theyre trying to outdo each other
4288734 you would be hard pressed to find another game where you have two competitors of that magnitude on the mound in the same game
4288735 you could sense right away that was going to be a good one
4288736 those pitchers dont give up many runs so you have to try and scratch when you get a chance
4288737 he gave me some pitches to hit and fortunately i was able to do something with them
4288738 the balls werent hit too hard they hit them where we werent
4288739 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4288740 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4288741 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4288742 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup heintz said
4288743 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4288744 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150 for a player of my current status those are the real concerns i would love to take some of that fedex cup money and that would mean good things for me but i dont come to this week going man ive got to get in the fedex cup
4288745 there were different times where i was close to coming back to mls said the 38 year old keller who played most recently with fulham of the english premier league

4288778 i feel the sport of womens boxing needs fights like these to be recognized the 2008 beijing olympics began yet again without a female boxing division so many of us trained to become olympic medalist since that dream was shattered we move on to whats best for womens boxing
4288779 why not i spent over three years in the amateurs fighting the best and now with my next performance i get to put womens boxing in the limelight by proving that there should be olympic womens boxing i feel that instead of dominga and i fighting for a belt next thursday we should have been on nbc fighting for the gold medal for our countries
4288780 reporting to camp during the olympics has motivated me to train as hard as possible
4288781 training is going really well when i step into the ring i represent something that is larger than me i learned that at the 1992 olympics i intend on continuing to do whatever it takes to ensure a win against marquez
4288782 this is the most important fight of my career and given the fact that i am giving casamayor the advantage by moving up in weight im training extremely hard to be ready and comfortable fighting at 135
4288783 i am confident that the amount of effort i am putting into training at this weight will pay off
4288784 training camp is going great and everything is on schedule as it should be
4288785 having fought vernon once i know what to expect and i will come out on top again

4288791 when considered in the context of defamation law therefore communications of this kind are much more akin to slanders this cause of action being nowadays relatively rare than to the usual more permanent kind of communications found in libel actions people do not often take a thread and go through it as a whole like a newspaper article they tend to read the remarks make their own contributions if they feel inclined and think no more about it
4288792 offline casual conversations benefit from the more relaxed rules of slander where oral as opposed to written communications generally dont give a person a right to sue for defamation unless they have suffered actual damage as a result

4288859 por eso despu s que una y otra vez hemos elevado a dios nuestras preces suplicantes e invocado la luz del esp ritu de verdad para gloria de dios omnipotente que otorg su particular benevolencia a la virgen mar a para honor de su hijo rey inmortal de los siglos y vencedor del pecado y de la muerte para aumento de la gloria de la misma augusta madre y gozo y regocijo de toda la iglesia por la autoridad de nuestro se or jesucristo de los bienaventurados ap stoles pedro y pablo y nuestra proclamamos declaramos y definimos ser dogma divinamente revelado que la inmaculada madre de dios siempre virgen mar a cumplido el curso de su vida terrestre fue asunta en cuerpo y alma a la gloria celestial
4288860 p o xii no pretendi negar el hecho de la muerte solamente no juzg oportuno afirmar solemnemente como verdad que todos los creyentes deb an admitir la muerte de la madre de dios
4288861 los fieles siguiendo las ense anzas y gu a de sus pastores no encontraron dificultad en admitir que mar a hubiese muerto como muri su unig nito pero eso no les impidi creer y profesar abiertamente que su sagrado cuerpo no estuvo sujeto a la corrupci n del sepulcro y que no fue reducido a putrefacci n y cenizas el augusto tabern culo del verbo divino
4288862 hasta el siglo iv no hay documento alguno escrito que hable de la creencia de la iglesia expl citamente acerca de la asunci n de mar a sin embargo cuando se comienza a escribir sobre ella todos los autores siempre se refieren a una antigua tradici n de los fieles sobre el asunto se hablaba ya en el siglo ii de la muerte de mar a pero no se designaba con ese nombre de muerte sino con el de tr nsito sue o o dormici n lo cual indica que la muerte de mar a no hab a sido como la de todos los dem s hombres sino que hab a tenido algo de particular porque aunque de todos los difuntos se dec a que hab an pasado a una vida mejor no obstante para indicar ese paso se empleaba siempre la palabra muri o por lo menos se durmi en el se or pero nunca se le llamaba como a la de la virgen as especialmente y como por antonomasia el tr nsito el sue o
4288863 el hecho de que la iglesia proclame a mar a liberada del pecado original por singular privilegio divino no lleva a concluir que recibi tambi n la inmortalidad corporal
4288864 mar a sant sima nunca tuvo pecado por el privilegio de dios de su inmaculada concepci n por consiguiente no estaba sujeta a la muerte como no lo estaba jesucristo pero tambi n ella tom sobre s nuestro castigo nuestra muerte
4288865 mar a implicada en la obra redentora y asociada a la ofrenda salvadora de cristo pudo compartir el sufrimiento y la muerte con vistas a la redenci n de la humanidad

4288882 que resalta la amenaza que representa la agenda radical de john mccain a la seguridad de jubilaci n de millones de estadounidenses
4288883 cre an que el gobierno no deber a jugar un papel en asegurar una jubilaci n digna
4288884 john mccain est de acuerdo con esa antigua filosof a
4288885 al cumplir 73 a os el seguro social los estadounidenses estamos unidos en decirle no a george w bush y sus esfuerzos por privatizar el seguro social y en este aniversario vamos a asegurarnos que john mccain escuche el mismo mensaje que no se atreva a tocar nuestro seguro social
4288886 es dificil recordarlo ahora pero antes del seguro social casi la mitad de los ancianos estadounidenses viv an en la pobreza luego de toda una vida de trabajar fuertemente no hab a niguna garant a de una jubilaci n segura
4288887 mi abuelo fraklin delano roosevelt y la mayor a de los estaudonidenses sab an que eso no estaba bien ellos cre an que sacar de la pobreza a personas de la tercera edad era reflecci n de los valores de nuestra naci n
4288888 por eso hace 73 a os hoy mi abuelo firm el proyecto de ley del seguro social uno de los triunfos m s grandes del siglo xx el seguro social asegura el bienestar de 13 millones de personas de la tercera edad y 1 3 millones de ni os
4288889 en 1935 una peque a minor a no compart a esos valores
4288890 john mccain est de acuerdo con esa antigua filosof a
4288891 nuestro seguro social no es una verg enza es un pacto de confianza entre las generaciones y es un reflejo de nuestros valores
4288892 al cumplir 73 a os el seguro social los estadounidenses estamos unidos en decirle no a george w bush y sus esfuerzos por privatizar el seguro social
4288893 y en este aniversario vamos a asegurarnos que john mccain escuche el mismo mensaje
4288894 that highlights the threat john mccains radical out of touch agenda poses to the retirement security of millions of americans
4288895 believed that government should not have a role in ensuring a retirement with dignity john mccain agrees with that old way of thinking
4288896 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security
4288897 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4288898 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4288899 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4288900 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4288901 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4288902 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4288903 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security

4289068 i am opposed to same sex marriages for a number of reasons i believe marriage is a cornerstone of our society while i am always hesitant to amend the constitution i would support a carefully worded simple amendment stating marriage is between one man and one woman however i am adamantly opposed to courts legislating from the bench it is a fundamental cornerstone of the separation of powers in our form of government and all americans should be concerned when courts overturn laws without sound constitutional basis solely based on their interpretation of what our society now recognizes
4289069 millions of americans cant enjoy the legal protections of marriage because of their orientation i believe that two committed adults of the same sex should be able to enjoy full marriage rights in the united states and that no federal state or local jurisdiction should be able to deny any of the benefits of the marriage to same sex couples the so called defense of marriage act must be repealed

4289096 with dre the entire process is fast and the results come out fast too so the losers will feel less pain as they await the results

4289103 in parlamentul romaniei exista o coalitie impotriva justitiei cred se poate spune deschis ca in parlament domneste suveranitatea coruptiei nationale parlamentarii din toate partidele se apara de anchetele dna aceasta se poate observa din conduita de vot de miercuri si a putut fi observata si in alte cazuri cum ar fi suspendarea presedintelui si atunci s a format o coalitie transpartinica care a votat impotriva presedintelui care a sustinut clar cerintele bruxelles ului in materie de lupta anticoruptie impreuna cu fostul ministru monica macovei data afara din guvern imediat dupa aderare din pacate lupta impotriva coruptiei nu este luata in serios decit de o parte a politicienilor romani

4289112 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case

4289121 l am invatat deja citeva lucruri prin metoda repetitiei intrucit el reproduce anumite gesturi insa vrem sa l invatam
4289122 in decurs de 24 de ore s au produs legaturi intre neuroni
4289123 intr o saptamina s au produs impulsuri electrice spontane similare cu cele dintr un creier obisnuit
4289124 am utilizat aceasta reactie pentru a atasa creierul robotului prin intermediul electrozilor creierul a preluat controlul robotului iar acesta invata prin repetitie
4289125 in prezent studiem modalitatea prin care sa il facem sa invete marind intensitatea anumitor electrozi
4289126 daca se afla intr un anumit loc si vrem sa il facem sa mearga la dreapta putem trimite un stimul electric pentru a i da ordinul vrem sa intelegem cum sint stocate amintirile intr un creier biologic in comparatie cu creierul unui calculator la ora actuala estimam ca exista intre 50 000 si 100 000 de neuroni activi
4289127 este o versiune simplificata a ceea ce se petrece in creierul uman insa pe acesta il putem privi si putem controla elementele esentiale asa cum dorim
4289128 eu am platit partea mea ma surprinde sa aud acest lucru
4289129 nu am timp sa ma ocup doar de poli acum acolo sint oameni de afaceri sa se ocupe ei este o conducere la club sa ii convoace si sa discute cu ei cind echipa merge bine toata lumea incearca sa isi aroge meritele cind echipa nu merge bine toata lumea vine la primar
4289130 documentele sint semnate mai sint ceva probleme legate de capitalul social si trebuie reglementate situatia este in lucru dar inca nu s a rezolvat actionarii au dat o parte din bani ca aport la capitalul social iar alta parte ca reclama am avut nevoie urgenta de fonduri iar acum trebuie sa clarificam situatia
4289131 si acum s a facut proiectul de buget si fiecare plateste proportional cu actiunile reclama la club
4289132 am semnat acte am achitat bani nu stiu ce s a intimplat
4289133 eu am platit partea mea ma surprinde sa aud acest lucru am semnat acte am achitat bani pentru cei 4 nu stiu ce s a intimplat mai departe sint curios daca s a intimplat altceva lucrurile ar fi trebuit sa fie in ordine
4289134 eu stiu ca am platit banii pentru partea mea am semnat actele probabil ca sint in curs de inregistrare nu sint probleme intre actionari sint bani la club nu sint in colaps eu sint increzator fotbalul trebuie sustinut nu vom cistiga campionatul dar nici nu vom retrograda noi avem buget cit dau altii pe un jucator dar s a facut treaba buna mie mi au placut cum au jucat cu steaua
4289135 i challenge any reporter or apa member to sit down with 100 post abortive women and look into our eyes their report is a blatant disregard for women who are in abortion recovery
4289136 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
4289137 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
4289138 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
4289139 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
4289140 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
4289141 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
4289142 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
4289143 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
4289144 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
4289145 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
4289146 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
4289147 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
4289148 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
4289149 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
4289150 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
4289151 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
4289152 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
4289153 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
4289154 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
4289155 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
4289156 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
4289157 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
4289158 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
4289159 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
4289160 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
4289161 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
4289162 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
4289163 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
4289164 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
4289165 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
4289166 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
4289167 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
4289168 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
4289169 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
4289170 mr bracks finds that the industry needs to continue embracing global competition but also acknowledges the challenges it faces not least climate change
4289171 am inceput o relatie cu acesta in iunie 2006 si am terminat o in luna august cind am aflat ca era casatorit
4289172 daniel mancas urma sa vina in apartamentul in care locuiam iar vlad urma sa plece pentru ca avea treaba
4289173 i am spus ca vreau sa mi vad de viata mea si ca m a mintit de la bun inceput s a enervat si m a lovit cu palma peste fata
4289174 eu am mai ramas un minut in camera si cind am intrat in sufragerie am vazut ca partea vatamata avea un briceag tip fluture in mina iar vlad incerca sa il deposedeze de acesta
4289175 vlad s a intors spre mine si mi a spus ca din cauza mea s a intimplat asta pentru ca nu am fost transanta cerindu mi sa l termin in acel moment am luat cutitul de jos si am aplicat o lovitura in zona gitului vlad era furios iar eu m am speriat mi s a facut frica
4289176 vlad mi a spus ca a lasat masina la cineva sa i dea foc
4289177 this is one of the worlds deadliest viruses we know the percentage of recovered animals continue to carry the virus but we dont know what proportion that is
4289178 but we certainly know that it happens and there has been reappearances of the virus in that animal and that is a real risk
4289179 it was a tough decision but largely based on the opinion from the medical profession the risk to humans outweigh keeping the animal alive in the long term
4289180 the last two generations of his family were 100 per cent runners to winners
4289181 a fost o sedinta iar mai multi primari s au plins ca pe teritoriul comunelor se fac investitii iar ei nu au nici o autoritate asupra lor sint lucrari ale consiliului judetean cum ar fi modernizarea drumurilor pe baza acestei dispozitii ei vor fi imputerniciti de consiliul judetean sa verifice astfel de investitii
4289182 dispozitiile au fost semnate deja de presedintele consiliului judetean constantin simirad banii vor fi alocati din fondul special nu sint primele actiuni de acest gen finantate de consiliul judetean
4289183 nu au fost depuse oferte vrem sa vindem deseuri feroase rezultate si din dezafectarea masinilor abandonate si ridicate de pe domeniul public vom repeta licitatia pentru ca vrem sa scapam de ele probabil ca au fost probleme si din cauza ca este o perioada de concedii
4289184 este vorba despre o manipulare directa aceste persoane nu au intrat ca democrate in inchisoare si nici nu au iesit democrate au fost inchise pentru un crez politic si nu unul religios insisi legionarii sint adepti ai regimurilor totalitare iar aceasta miscare politica a atras in anii 30 40 foarte multi adepti de diverse orientari si profesii inclusiv clerici din punctul meu de vedere orice actiune care merge pe jumatati de adevar este periculoasa iar manipularea opiniei publice cu astfel de expozitii este blamabila
4289185 orice istoric stie ca doua dintre personajele expuse arsenie boca si sandu tudor s au dezis din start de miscarea legionara chiar daca s a intimplat ca unii din ei sa fie si legionari pentru toti acestia era mai presus crezul crestin dovada ca dupa iesirea din inchisoare s au calugarit consider ca acesta este un atac nefondat expozitia este o manifestare culturala si atit
4289186 nu cunosc despre asocierea cu fundatia rost si nici ca aceasta expoizitie are caracter itinerant noua ni s a solicitat in primavara sprijinul pentru a participa la o expozitie care sa ilustreze represiunea comunista cei doi cercetatori ai cnsas implicati in proiect nu ne au comunicat mai mult de atit imi pare rau ca cnsas este implicat in acest lucru fara stiinta sa
4289187 trebuie sa fie o neintelegere la mijloc cum sa nu stie ca sint coorganizatori
4289188 pina la urma si miscarea legionara este o etapa a istoriei noastre
4289189 este un parteneriat nefericit care s a realizat intre doua institutii de prestigiu cnsas si complexul muzeal national moldova iasi care este in subordinea ministerului culturii cu asociatia rost o organizatie ortodoxista apropiata de ideile legionare cine intra pe site ul revistei acestei asociatii vede cu usurinta ca promoveaza idei si oameni care au activat in miscarea legionara pe de alta parte insusi continutul acestei expozitii este unul pe care noi il privim cu consternare a face imagine unor persoane care au activat in extrema dreapta romaneasca este un lucru de neacceptat a combate comunismul de tip stalinist nu inseamna in nici un caz a promova miscarea legionara prefer sa cred ca nici conducerea cnsas si nici ministerul culturii nu si au dat acordul asupra continutului acestei expozitii
4289190 noi am fost solicitati sa punem un spatiu la dispozitie pentru aceasta expozitie care este itineranta nu participam la organizarea evenimentului nu stiam ca ar putea fi probleme colegi de ai mei au vizionat o la vaslui unde s a bucurat de succes pina la urma si miscarea legionara este o etapa a istoriei noastre nu sintem nici pro si nici contra insa nu consider ca este o problema sa prezentam si astfel de aspecte daca stiam ca este cu probleme nici nu am fi primit o
4289191 my mom and dad can pick about two quarts an hour

4289193 sometimes we sell all day and still have some left
4289194 sometimes you find piles of bear droppings on the ground filled with blueberries
4289195 ideea mi a venit din satul de vacanta de la mamaia si m am gindit sa fac o afacere care sa mearga constant nu doar sezonier in 2001 am vindut dacia 1310 pe care o aveam si cu cei 1 500 de dolari pe care i am luat pe ea ma gindeam sa plec din tara nu am mai reusit si m am gindit sa fac ceva cu banii aia am luat legatura cu cei din satul de vacanta din mamaia care vindeau vata de zahar si cineva mi a promis ca mi face rost si mie de masini
4289196 am vorbit cu cel din constanta si i am trimis 800 de dolari prin posta in schimb am primit o masina artizanala si celelalte trei masini erau mai mult niste schelete le am adus cu trenul in iasi am cautat un meserias care sa se priceapa si din alea patru asa zise masini mi a facut una singura dar macar functiona
4289197 nu am sa uit niciodata prima luna de activitate eram suparat ca practic pierdusem cei 800 de dolari dar in martie 2002 cind am iesit pe piata cu masina am cistigat 500 de dolari in urmatoarea luna mi am acoperit toti banii pierduti si m am mutat in curtea unei familii in copou le plateam chirie 100 de lei pe luna si am vindut acolo pina in 2004 din banii cistigati am reusit sa mi cumpar o masina noua care facea si popcorn si vata de zahar pe bat incorporate intr o toneta
4289198 cea de a doua toneta m a costat tot 6 000 de euro sint luate din afara dar nu va spun exact de unde pentru ca nu vreau sa maresc concurenta intr un sezon de 8 luni de zile martie octombrie pentru ca atunci merge cel mai bine floricele si vata de zahar pe bat mi au adus un cistig in mina de peste 5 000 de euro
4289199 sint zile si zile in cursul saptaminii vindem in medie cam de 150 de lei pe zi iar simbata si duminica ajungem si pina la 600 de lei pe zi pentru ca vin parintii cu copii aici merge mai bine ca in copou
4289200 in medie se vind amindoua produse la fel dar de multe ori ma salveaza floricele si totul depinde de vreme iarna inchid in copou si las doar toneta din centru simbata si duminica iar in sezon daca ploua poti face si doar 10 lei intr o zi intreaga recordul a fost in anul 2002 cu masina veche cu ocazia tirgului de oale atunci am vindut de 1 400 de lei intr o singura zi
4289201 la curent chirie contabila angajat si impozite platesc pentru o singura masina in jur de 1 330 de lei pe luna la aceste cheltuieli se adauga zaharul din care dintr un kilogram ies 20 de vate de zahar betele le iau cu baxul si ma ajung la 15 bani bucata grauntele de porumb ma costa 4 lei kilogramul untul de cocos e cel mai scump ca este din malaezia si dau 7 lei pe kilogram iar ambalajele ma ajung la 750 de lei pe luna
4289202 aproximativ jumatate dintre patronii care si au deschis firma in cursul acestui an au ales sa investeasca in domeniul serviciilor destul de multe solicitari au fost inregistrate pentru firmele ce au ca obiect de activitate comertul cu amanuntul dar au existat cereri si in domeniul constructiilor
4289203 este o situatie dificila pe piata farmaceuticelor in general au avut loc schimbari din cauza noii liste de medicamente asupra careia s a incercat o diminuare a preturilor iar ulterior s a revenit cresterea redusa vinzarilor este o consecinta a faptului ca preturile medicamentelor nu au mai fost modificate anul acesta
4289204 la data si ora controlului 14 august 2008 inspectorii nostri au constatat la service ul moldocar srl mai multe probleme pe de o parte este vorba de lipsa afisarii autorizatiei punctului de lucru eliberata de registrul auto roman pentru activitatea de intretinere reparatii autoturisme iar pe de alta parte s a constatat lipsa afisarii tarifelor practicate pe operatiune sau ora adica manopera

4289270 ceasing production of coated fish allows us to focus on our frozen meals division which is an area of growth for vesco foods
4289271 we have invested approximately 2 million over the past 18 months in frozen meal infrastructure and equipment at our osborne park site in western australia to meet increasing demand
4289272 after 34 years the decision to stop producing coated fish is sad news for some of our longest serving and very loyal employees

4289278 he needs to be careful when hes talking about irrigation communities because in buying the water from irrigators thats not going to be compensating the entire community
4289279 and in taking water out of community areas you are stripping not only the people who are irrigators but those who rely on those irrigators the people who supply services to them the retailers where the irrigators spend money you are actually taking the heart out of the entire community
4289280 so there needs to be some work done on where should be targeted and that needs to take into the account the social and economic consequences of stripping entire regional communities

4289304 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4289305 the birds have to make a judgment do they expend most of their energy flying long distances to the uk where they know the winters are likely to be mild and where they will find food or do they save energy take a shorter journey but then risk their food supply running out
4289306 these are the choices forced on them by climate change

4289322 people in the know know what a dynamic leader he is and what an accomplished governor he was
4289323 most of the country doesnt know exactly who he is and so i think this is an amazing opportunity for him to be introduced to a wider group of people

4289329 to set the tone to in a way capture the spirit and the essential elements of what is going to come out of the convention
4289330 it is in general supposed to be painting the face of the concerns of the party

4289356 at once shrewd and compassionate funny and inspiring rosemary ekossos first novel is both a devastating critique of prevailing attitudes to women in her native cameroon and a recognition of the universal sexual interdependency that makes the struggle for equality so complex sympathetic characters and an intriguing plot make this an essential read for those concerned with womens aspirations both within and outside africa
4289357 house of falling women is a powerful story about the oppressive weight and irrationality of tradition gender and class inequality a desperate yearning for freedom and dignity and a journey of self discovery empowerment and redemption
4289358 i would strongly suggest that the author packs her bags heads back to paris and hands her passport in to the french authorities with all possible haste
4289359 an obnoxious article from a woman from a country that is completely irrelevant in todays world
4289360 well we may all have huge bottoms but at least we use proper toilets here in england unlike the french who insist on going by the side of the road leave paris and not ten miles out of the city you start to see country lanes strewn with toilet paper disgusting i went to france once and never want to see the place again
4289361 dressing well has never been a big thing here in the uk youll get used to it pretentious sanctimonious arrogant small minded boring chauvinistic very french indeed
4289362 the country is increasingly anti elitist ferociously aggressively and smugly working class and anti intellectual
4289363 hortense is an alter ego a vehicle for long to simultaneously expose the vanity and chauvinism of the french and the slobbishness and insularity of the english

4289369 the only part of the so called national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples is their national debt
4289370 rich nations should accept the burden of debt relief for the poor
4289371 never before have so many people forced a change of policy onto a global agenda if anyone had said eight weeks ago will we get a doubling of aid will we get a deal on debt people would have said no

4289373 six hundred thousand africans mostly children will remember this g8 summit at gleneagles because they will be around to remember this summit and they wouldnt have otherwise
4289374 grotesquely cynical manoeuvre in placing himself at the forefront of the anti poverty campaign and says that if sir bob and sir bono really wanted to help they would stand in whitehall and call on poor countries to tear up the debts because they have already paid
4289375 the g8 communiqu announcing the victory for millions is unequivocal under a section headed g8 proposals for hipc debt cancellation it says that debt relief to poor countries will be granted only if they are shown adjusting their gross assistance flows by the amount given in other words their aid will be reduced by the same amount as the debt relief so they gain nothing
4289376 the 55 billion claimed by the observer comes down at most to 1bn spread over 18 countries
4289377 the first unmentionable is that the gold was originally plundered from africa the second is that debt payments are due to rise next year more than doubling by 2015 this will mean not victory for millions but death for millions
4289378 at present for every 1 of aid to africa 3 are taken out by western banks institutions and governments and that does not account for the repatriated profit of transnational corporations
4289379 the african growth and opportunity act which sounds like a benevolent multilateral trade agreement between the us and africa forces participants to remove subsidies from their industries while allowing the us to subsidise its own and insists on privatisation of social services such as water even in countries that face drought
4289380 the non government organisations working in the continent have described the agreement as a colonial imposition that provides the us with cheap labour and goods and tax free energy
4289381 the returns are not for africans though while 70 percent of nigerians exist on a dollar a day shell continues to make megaprofits from oil drilling in the country taking an estimated 30bn out of the ground since the 1950s
4289382 at present 12 percent of us oil comes from africa and by 2015 when the uns millennium goals to halve world poverty will be laughably incomplete that proportion will have reached 25 percent
4289383 poverty and the needs of the african population will take second place to us geo political strategy in the lexicon of aid and trade the nepad agreements and the agoa there are only three letters that really matter to the us in africa they are o i l
4289384 a ridiculously small amount of us aid far less than 1 percent of its total aid budget is spent in sub saharan africa the poorest place on earth a lot of the funds go to pakistan to israel to countries that assist in the uss strategic interests in that respect foreign aid is as it always was a tool of foreign policy
4289385 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4289386 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4289387 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4289388 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4289389 we still dont have a motive and its going to be difficult to determine that
4289390 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times

4289392 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him

4289428 it was decided that tacons main strategy should be to play down the health argument and concentrate instead on the economic
4289429 this proved to be the correct approach especially as nigerias economy has been suffering from the world recession
4289430 the young adult music platform of the b amp h label is the type of image enhancement we need in nigeria
4289431 the international tobacco companies have to develop these markets because the smoking rates in the us and the uk have consistently dropped based on litigation in the us and public health pressures in the uk
4289432 we dont market to children and we have never attempted to do so

4289458 we are constantly reminded by our betters that only zimbabweans can decide their future but you can only be conscious actors for change if there is a level political field not only for the holding of elections but also in the run up
4289459 instead we have the destruction of the rule of law the judiciary the press and the economy and the brutalisation of the population with a quarter of the countrys population now living in the diaspora and with the army and the civil service instruments and controllers of the ruling party

4289462 se putea obtine victoria poate ca sansele noastre au crescut acum dar avem in fata un adversar puternic care are in lot jucatori de valoare cu experienta la acest nivel fata de jocurile de pregatire antrenorul adversarei a venit cu trei modificari
4289463 toja este inca la primul joc oficial si cred ca si a indeplinit foarte bine misiunea asteptam mai mult de la el in faza ofensiva pentru ca stim ca poate in urmatoarele doua saptamini ne vom pregati pentru a depasi unele probleme si vrem sa ajungem la un grad mai ridicat in ceea ce priveste jocul pe noi ne intereseaza calificarea nu vom face un joc de asteptare ci vrem sa obtinem ceea ce ne am dorit calificarea in grupe
4289464 daca spunea cineva inaintea meciului ca vom avea 2 0 si se va termina egal nu il credeam galatasaray este o echipa puternica acum nu pot spune prea multe cuvinte nici nu am apucat sa vorbesc cu marius lacatus e foarte bine dar era mult mai bine daca raminea 2 1 sint multumit de jocul echipei 0 0 1 1 ne calificam banel a fost cel mai bun de pe teren a alergat cel mai mult
4289465 este un rezultat bun dar daca lacatus facea o schimbare la pauza cu mirel radoi la mijlocul terenului atunci cistigam cu 2 1 oricum deja am facut un pas spre calificare le am cam luat piuitul turcilor la 2 0
4289466 dupa cele doua goluri primite ne am revenit am avut multe ocazii prin lincoln si arda iar nonda a inscris pentru a ne aduce egalarea spre jumatatea reprizei secunde a inceput sa se vada ca pina acum am jucat doar meciuri de pregatire am vazut ca jucatorii refacuti dupa accidentari inca nu sint pregatiti in ultimele 15 minute s a vazut clar oboseala sint convins ca in meciul retur vom fi mai in forma pentru ca vom avea jucate supercupa si un meci din campionatul intern
4289467 sint foarte fericit ca am ajuns la racing si voi incerca sa fac tot posibilul ca echipa sa obtina cele mai bune rezultate

4289490 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4289491 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4289492 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4289493 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4289494 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4289503 for the us industry to exist we must have an economically stable coffee industry in the producing world
4289504 this particular scheme is going to hurt the ethiopian coffee farmers economically
4289505 ability to respond to external issues wherever and whenever they arise
4289506 coffee shops can sell sidamo and harar coffees for up to 14 a pound because of the beans speciality status
4289507 but ethiopian coffee farmers only earn between 30p and 59p for their crop barely enough to cover the cost of production i think most people would see that as an injustice
4289508 coffee farmers are getting on average 24 cents a pound while consumers in rich countries are paying roughly 3 60 a pound a mark up of 1500 coffee now costs more to grow and pick than it does to sell
4289509 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates

4289511 we achieved this goal in canada india and the us we can provide full incoming and outgoing sms service without passing along operator fees in these countries
4289512 in countries like canada or the us where wi fi and internet access is fairly ubiquitous at this point sms is less of an issue for twitter users
4289513 there is an opportunity now for twitter to forge an alliance with a mobile operator that is switched on to the fact that twitter is the new text message
4289514 everyone understands that as a business twitter needs to make money in the same way that people are happy that google does search ads they want twitter to make money because they are fans of the system
4289515 if we deal with this in a positive way we can resolve all the issues that havent been solved between the two countries

4289518 the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion and or slightly flatter noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much what redeems it is the idea only an idea at the back of it not a sentimental pretence but an idea and an unselfish belie f in the idea something you can set up and bow down before and offer a sacrifice to

4289524 the origin of the term mummy comes to us from medieval medical practice you will find it strange mummy comes from the persian word mummeia it means pitch or asphalt which was naturally occurring crude oil that oozed to the surface mummeia was a prized medicine in europe but was in limited supply in time clever business entrepreneur took resin from mummies and sold it as mummeia it wasnt long until entire mummies including dried bones and flesh were ground up and peddled it as medicine also soon the term mummy was extended to the lot would you try it yourself if you find all of this bizarre there is more to be told the export of mummies became big business in the fifteenth century with their export for medicinal purposes more were taken for european museum collections many ended up in private collections or the dusty basements of universities in the nineteenth century canadian paper manufacturers imported mummies to use the linen wrappings to make high quality rag paper the fate of the bodies is not known mark twain rreported the use of mummies for fuel in the steam engines of the egyptian railways

4289959 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4289960 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4289961 im not like your fella who likes to talk about the other team all the time i only have a sense for my team and what they are trying to do
4289962 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to do
4289963 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4289964 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4289965 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players
4289966 thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4289967 i think it is a step up its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4289968 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands

4289981 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

4289983 one of the most impressive showings ive seen out of an amateur in years
4289984 in case you were wondering china actually kicked our american butt a long time ago as china surpassed the united states as the worlds second largest gold producer in 2007 with 270
4289985 is the most negative ratio of gold shares to gold in the last five years this week the ratio got even more negative with the ratio plunging to 0 176 people simply hate gold shares
4289986 since most profitable investors use contrarian opinion the ratio is a screaming buy signal for both gold and gold shares
4289987 gold production is stagnating and output in the leading gold producing countries continues to fall year on year despite higher gold prices leading geologists to wonder whether we may have or may soon have reached the point of peak gold production the worlds biggest producer south africa produced nearly 1000 tonnes of gold in 1980 this was down to 264 tonnes last year the lowest since 1932
4289988 the china gold association announced that chinas gold output was expected to reach 300 tons in 2008 surpassing that of south africa and making china the worlds largest gold producer
4289989 surpassed the united states as the worlds second largest gold producer in 2007 with 270 491 tons of output
4289990 gold and silver are cheap vs many commodities and oil
4289991 the long term average gold to oil ratio is 15 to 1 or 15 barrels of oil to one ounce of gold
4289992 gold has traded at over 30 times a barrel of oil
4289993 should there be a classic reversion to the mean average of 4 4 in the ratio of ounces of silver per barrel of oil then silver prices would rise to 30 per ounce and silver is selling at less than half that price right now
