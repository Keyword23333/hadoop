4770000 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4770001 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4770002 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4770003 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4770004 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4770005 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4770006 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4770007 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4770008 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4770009 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4770010 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4770011 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4770012 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4770013 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4770014 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4770015 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4770016 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4770017 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4770018 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4770019 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4770020 hemos demostrado que angola no es solamente el pa s del petr leo la guerra y la pobreza

4770022 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4770023 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4770024 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4770025 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4770026 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4770027 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4770028 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4770029 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4770030 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4770031 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4770032 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4770033 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4770034 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4770035 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4770036 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4770037 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4770038 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4770039 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4770040 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4770041 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4770042 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4770043 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4770044 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4770045 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4770046 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4770047 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4770048 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4770049 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4770050 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4770051 its very easy to plan when we have green field applications but we know that from here on in most applications coming before us are going to be of an in fill nature
4770052 what the ruling did was give me confidence that our policies are reasonable logical and rational smart growth doesnt mean dumping as much height everywhere especially in very stable residential areas like lakeview
4770053 the omb has recognized the qualities of the neighbourhood that it was important to maintain our sky views lake views and the tree canopy
4770054 i hope queenscorp will now engage with us and the city and come up with a mutually acceptable plan
4770055 the proposal represents a development that is too high too intensive and does not provide adequate setbacks or buffers to adjacent uses this is in context of relatively recent provincial and city planning initiatives that have clearly set out the preferred locations for the intensification being proposed by queenscorp

4770146 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4770147 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4770148 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4770149 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4770150 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4770151 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4770152 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4770153 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4770154 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4770155 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people

4770161 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat

4770163 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
4770164 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4770165 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4770166 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4770167 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4770168 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
4770169 the more things change the more they stay the same
4770170 the more things change the more they stay the same

4770178 throughout the years we have always been competitive despite changing coaches frequently we have such a big squad that we have to be competitive on all fronts like the other teams we have also reinforced our team
4770179 he is a very important player for the team i think that with his help and without fans behind us we will not have any problems winning the tie
4770180 we will have to focus at the back we must not go mad going forward because the team has great quality in that area we have to avoid conceding a goal
4770181 the squad want revenge we went out tow in the game but we had no luck but we are still in it and we are only focussed on beating them and qualifying
4770182 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4770183 my family and myself are very thankful to the club the fans and the city and we will never give up fighting to get the best for liverpool

4770191 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe

4770196 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
4770197 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow

4770224 it seems to me that the real political task in a society such as ours is to criticize the working of the institutions which appear to be both neutral and independent to criticize them in such a way that the political violence which has always exercised itself obscurely through them will be unmasked so that we can fight them

4770260 in 2002 our predecessors concluded that there had been a lack of progress in implementing the recommendations from an earlier report five years on a quarter of government organisations still cannot provide data on the cost of their websites and where data were provided over 40 of organisations provided only estimates further 16 of government organisations do not have a good knowledge about the users of their websites even where user data are being collected they are not always being used to inform and improve websites
4770261 for many millions of people the internet has become the preferred way of conducting many every day transactions from banking to booking a holiday it is often faster easier to use and more convenient with services available 24 hours a day seven days a week the internet has also become an important way of improving the delivery of public services
4770262 the internet is transforming the way in which government communicates with and provides services to citizens but the governments enthusiastic embrace of this new world of web delivered services is not matched by a commensurate level of understanding of what it is achieving through its websites how effective they are or whether they represent value for money
4770263 it is essential that the dwp the department responsible for these sites should arrange for regular independent reviews of how they are developing and the associated risks
4770264 they must not be left behind as the governments use of the internet gathers pace
4770265 nuestro jefe de estado ha se alado con claridad que la parte georgiana es inaceptable para osetia del sur
4770266 this vulnerability has been disclosed on the 14th may 2007 to the php developers they were explicitly told that they
4770267 information management systems and practices are outdated and inefficient and this has a severe impact on our ability to deliver effective services to children and carers
4770268 the system we were working on was developed in the mid to late 1990s and was built on outdated systems software and architecture
4770269 because no one had committed any money to upgrading or changing the system as time went on and our work changed it just became further and further out of synch with what we were doing
4770270 information was never available in real time which was frustrating for staff and made it difficult for child safety workers to collaborate or share information across the state
4770271 the system was a real chore for child safety officers
4770272 they should be focused on being out in the field working with people not sitting inside an office entering information into a system that doesnt give them anything back
4770273 we needed a system that would provide an integrated client and carer view across agencies to improve the quality of decision making statewide in turn this would enable practitioners to respond much faster and more effectively to the needs of children and young people at risk
4770274 the comprehensive review microsoft consulting services carried out demonstrated that an off the shelf solution wouldnt cut it we would need to build a custom application from scratch
4770275 the relationships we needed to track around each child were very complex and that was fundamental to any reporting we did window dressing was useless if the core engine within the system didnt operate the way we needed it to
4770276 it was a great opportunity to develop strong relationships with other microsoft partners
4770277 the importance of this project for queensland was a real driving force for everyone involved
4770278 readify was engaged primarily for development but we capitalized on our other skills and experience to help the project in areas such as user experience security databases and the communication stack
4770279 this project was one of those special moments in a developers career when you think wow this really means something
4770280 most traditional software development projects do not start automated testing until the project is 60 to 80 percent built which is far too late
4770281 doing daily tests in the solutions development centre meant we immediately caught any issues and could rectify them before they affected other aspects of the project this greatly increased the quality and speed of the build
4770282 as we approached critical times such as releases we would have weekly conference calls to discuss progress address concerns and escalate any issues
4770283 it really was a partnership between organizations totally committed to the same goal
4770284 we focused on building an extensible underlying framework so the solution could later be expanded to other parts of their business
4770285 microsoft brought a huge wealth of it experience exceptional project management skills and in depth technical expertise
4770286 they displayed above and beyond commitment throughout the project and really understood how critical the icms was for us
4770287 microsofts disciplined approach to development resulted in a system which since it went live in march 2007 has had no unscheduled outages
4770288 the application is reliable and robust and weve been very impressed with its performance
4770289 the icms gives us crucial information we didnt have access to before such as identifying the known members of a household around a child at any point in time which an off the shelf customer relationship management system cant do
4770290 this quality of information helps us address the care needs of a particular child based on the risk level of his or her current situation
4770291 the information we have stored on the icms must be protected by the highest possible security and privacy internally and externally
4770292 microsoft technology gives us the peace of mind that this information is secure
4770293 the icms has really helped the department begin to understand the importance and power of the information we have and how we can use it
4770294 for example we will now be able to conduct extensive research and analysis of child safety issues using the information we can extract from the icms
4770295 forms and automated workflows help guide staff through the process they need to follow and allow team leaders to track and monitor work
4770296 it ensures department staff follow correct business processes and comply with our legislative policy and practice requirements
4770297 the project raised our credibility within the queensland government because we delivered something several larger agencies couldnt achieve
4770298 this partnership between microsoft and the department of child safety really stands out as a success
4770299 the icms gives me quick access to a holistic view of information from every child safety service centre about a client
4770300 the icms has taken child protection to another level it has allowed the department to operate as a whole this is vital especially because we have to deal with so many mobile families i would love to be able to have the same level of access to child protection information across the country
4770301 today you cant tell the it staff whom to go to when there is a production performance problem
4770302 there is more dependence on the developer who understands how things are supposed to fit together but the developer doesnt work for it
4770303 software architects very often dont know the mismatch between what they designed and how it behaves
4770304 most of what we call application performance management has been around for a long time the tools look at how applications use resources and they see misuse of a resource as an indicator of a problem
4770305 that was how application performance management was done on the mainframe thats the way java probes started they answered questions like is it out of threads or is it using too much memory but the big recent trend is to focus much more on the end user experience
4770306 whether you like it or not you are going to support the application in production
4770307 it is a bitter pill to swallow for the team
4770308 if it is an important application the it folks are not going to be able to support the application in production you will need to create a team to support the application in production or the problems in production will upset your ability to build the next release and that is bad
4770309 things are usually architected in hub and spoke architecture with the application logic and java or net server at the center
4770310 that is the java server in the point guard of the application
4770311 if you can get a view into the health of the server you have a lot of information
4770312 there is more dependence on developers who understand how things are fit together
4770313 glassbox uses aspect oriented programming to identify problems such as too many database calls or a remote call that was too long it identifies jdbc queries that are too slow it identifies a slow database call or too many fast ones
4770314 it measures the main things that are likely to be a problem it takes away complexity giving you
4770315 but he does remark that tools that measure for more than just the most likely problems
4770316 to be able to identify who the people are that can solve the problem
4770317 if development uses an agile format they are likely interacting with qa in a much more diplomatic way than i have seen in the past because qa has to test their code on a much more frequent basis
4770318 from a performance perspective many of the problems have been reasonably solved but many developers may be working with false assumptions about what are good practices in java
4770319 with java there are a lot of performance problems that have been solved but developers need to re educate themselves
4770320 yep thats how my guy will look at me thats how we will delight each other
4770321 mr all that you have ever hoped for is right before your eyes

4770414 so which goes the faith in americas greatness and goodness in the world or the facts which disclose the opposite at the very top

4770428 although they were aware of the threat burmas state run media failed to issue a timely warning to citizens in the storms path
4770429 its troubling that many of the burmese people learned of this impending disaster only when foreign outlets such as radio free asia and voice of america sounded the alarm
4770430 i cant speak to how large that would be but i feel assured that it would be substantial if we can give it
4770431 i hope that the military will realize they have to accept aid from everybody they can possibly accept it from and maybe that will be the something good that can come out of this terrible destruction
4770432 the response to the cyclone is just the most recent example of the juntas failure to meet its peoples basic needs
4770433 let the people of burma know that the united states is standing with them
4770434 orchestrated this vote to give false legitimacy to their continued rule
4770435 it would be very very odd i think if they went ahead
4770436 if it proceeds under current conditions the constitutional referendum they have planned should not be seen as a step toward freedom but rather as a confirmation of the unacceptable status quo
4770437 we appeal to china india and burmas fellow asean members to use their influence to encourage a democratic transition
4770438 and so many of the people in the arena here you know were underprivileged anyway so this this she chuckles slightly is working very well for them

4770440 truly it may be said that the outside of a mountain is good for the inside of a man
4770441 how i wish you could see the potential the potential of you and me its ike a book elegently bound but in a language that you cant read just yet
4770442 every library has a different way of shelving books it all depends upon the head librarian and sometimes the orderings make no sense however if you think first in terms of author name and then book title you can usually make sense of any library bookshelf if names dont work there are some few librarians that do everything by numbers written at the bottom of the spine if you find a library like this the first couple digits refer to the general category of the book such as 1 for fiction 2 for nonfiction 3 for histories and so on the second number is usually for the subtopic and the third is usually for the author so a book with the number 1 5 52 could be a fictional book about a farmers travels by old man meran
4770443 what are you doing here my brother it is wonderful to see you but we could both get in trouble if anyone finds you here with me
4770444 i dont know but there seems to but some kind of fight at the tower and i have been told not to leave here until tonight the whole story is too long to tell here though if we ever meet again i will tell it to you light but i hope we do meet again i must go before i get you into trouble
4770445 i havent the foggiest idea as to how to re sort any of these books
4770446 hello cant make anything of these bloody books either i was just inquiring if there was any logic to this madness my name is dahlia
4770447 pleased to meet you im laurencia i can think of ways to sort the books but i dont know how the librarians would like us to do it i was hoping that you or leloael had a better idea as to what we are to do
4770448 i am able to read but i never really got much more than the basic reading and writing skills that come from selling woodcarvings and other products our family didnt really have the money for further lessons and while my father tried his best i would greatly appreciate any help that you could give me with sorting books otherwise i suspect i could be here forever
4770449 i think ive got the system partly figured out but im not entirely sure
4770450 pleased to meet you im laurencia i can think of ways to sort the books but i dont know how the librarians would like us to do it i was hoping that you or leloael had a better idea as to what we are to do
4770451 you completely lost me after you started talking about subtopics could you maybe go over some of that again a little slower
4770452 so this library uses the three numbers at the bottom of the spine to organize the books the first for the topic the second for the subtopic and the third for the authors name the numbers represented what again
4770453 dont worry youll be reciting these numbers in your sleep soon enough i am sure
4770454 dont worry it took me a week to figure it out the first time i ever tried sorting books like that i have figured out a rather easy way to do it though it might take more time if you just look for numbers on books already on the shelves that match the numbers on the book you are trying to find a place for it should work
4770455 we should be gone wt least i should be i have more to do today
4770456 i am thirteen you are a little bit late mom

4770463 one of the things that gets my goat are statements that ive heard that the debate is over
4770464 its my understanding that the earth has warmed up and cooled down hundreds of times
4770465 the fact of the matter is that assemblyman dohertys opinion has no bearing on the reality of global warming
4770466 he can believe that jesus had a pet dinosaur if he wants but it doesnt make it true there is practically no credible dissention within the scientific community about the facts that doherty refuses to accept this is not a conservative or liberal issue nor should it be he is simply on the wrong side of reality

4770483 volgens ons is vertramming van de zuidtangent de beste oplossing omdat de huidige bus niet voldoende capaciteit heeft om aan de toekomstige groei van het aantal reizigers te voldoen na vertramming zullen reizigers vanuit het centrum van haarlem binnen vijftien minuten in hoofddorp zijn en binnen twintig minuten op schiphol bovendien biedt een lightrail voldoende capaciteit en is beter voor het milieu dan vervoer met de bus
4770484 dankzij de inspanning van de pvda zal de bereikbaarheid van heemstede van en naar hoofddorp aanzienlijk worden verbeterd
4770485 ze zijn gebaseerd op groeiprognoses uit 2002 de feitelijke groeicijfers van bijvoorbeeld de zuidtangent laten echter zien dat deze prognoses te laag zijn bovendien houdt het rapport geen rekening met de groei van het aantal reizigers in het openbaar vervoer als gevolg van de invoering van de kilometerbeprijzing
4770486 de zuidtangent als hoogwaardige busverbinding tussen haarlem en amsterdam zuid oost via hoofddorp en de luchthaven schiphol is een groot succes de snelle verbinding heeft op steeds meer mensen een grote aantrekkingskracht de groei van het aantal reizigers overtrof alle prognoses er liggen echter nog enkelel uitdagingen voor de toekomst e n daarvan is het ontbreken van een vrijliggende busbaan in het centrum van haarlem en de kruising met het spaarne daar ontstaan vaak opstoppingen waardoor grote vertragingen ontstaan de betrouwbaarheid van de zuidtangent staat daarmee onder druk
4770487 de huidige capaciteit van de vaarwegen is nog sterk onderbenut dat is jammer want de binnenvaart is een aantrekkelijk alternatief voor het wegverkeer waarmee het overbelaste wegennet in noord holland kan worden ontlast bovendien is de binnenvaart milieuvriendelijk per ton vracht stoot een schip zesmaal minder co2 uit dan een vrachtwagen

4770495 not many athletes get a chance to win a medal but for me this bronze which i won here shines like a gold because i think ive played all tournament pretty good tennis
4770496 i think it was tough mentally because for tennis players were conditioned to play play play until we lose and then its on to the next week
4770497 recent onderzoek naar het omslagpunt naar vertramming is voor de zuidtangent niet gedaan

4770511 operation sheridan was previously run in march 2008 when it resulted in four separate arrests for supply offences
4770512 additional success was seen in the disruption of dealer networks in march including the seizing of motor vehicles from known suspects by the roads policing unit
4770513 police recognise that disruption and detection operations are just one aspect of our approach to tackling drugs crime
4770514 we want the isle of wight to remain a safe place to live and visit so officers will continue to target those crimes and offenders that affect our communities
4770515 200 000 barrels per day is roughly equal to the daily production rate of just one new offshore platform in the gulf of mexico
4770516 despite these facts the eia projects that lifting the bans that prevent production on 85 percent of the ocs acreage surrounding the lower 48 states will yield an amount equal to that which can be produced from just one of these platforms obviously the projections are flawed the eia assumed that technically recoverable undiscovered oil resources in off limits areas of the ocs total 18 2 billion barrels based on the department of interiors mineral management services report to congress february 2006 but technically recoverable resources are based on current technology and economics historically technological improvements and on site exploration and development have increased technically recoverable resource estimates for example world proved oil reserves were estimated to be 521 billion barrels in 1971 when oil was 1 25 per barrel 6 61 in 2007 dollars and are estimated under present technology to be 1 317 billion barrels at an average price per barrel in 2007 of 67 eias analysis is based on crude oil prices averaging around 50 per barrel in 2005 dollars or around 80 per barrel in 2030 assuming a 2 percent per year inflation rate well below the current price of around 120 per barrel eias analysis assumes that exploration development and production of economical fields drilling schedules costs platform selection reserves to production ratios etc in the ocs are based on data from fields in the western gulf of mexico that are of similar water depth and size since the majority of the resources under moratoria 55 percent are off the coast of california the analysis should have used data from the santa barbara channel which would have provided more realistic assumptions and higher production levels eias analysis assumes that leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 yet off the coast of california some of these resources have already been leased a report from wall street research house sanford c bernstein says that california actually could start producing new oil within one year if the moratoria were lifted the california oil is under shallow water and already has been explored drilling platforms have been in place since before the moratorium further department of interior secretary kempthorne announced in july a new 5 year plan that will allow leasing to start 2 years earlier in 2010 implying production from currently unleased areas could begin as early as 2015 this new 5 year plan includes the areas under federal moratoria

4770525 poor victorine it looked as if her whole sunday was used up preparing her for a sexual act and it had taken place in the barnyard played by very minor stage hands well the greedy ardor and the final mounting disgust can sure be described as merely physical like too much lobster and no harm has been done by the extraneous to her soul a good and dreamless sleep in which she plays no part at all the sleep of the young and the good and the exhausted will purify her heart and give her strength for other daylight nightmares the big exaggeration of real life that does seem to the very young like a king sized out of drawing and hypnagogic bad dream as if the lenses in their eyes were borrowed from colts and fillies and the very size of the extravaganza the enormity of it implied hostility

4770528 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
4770529 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
4770530 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
4770531 if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

4770539 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
4770540 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever

4770542 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
4770543 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
4770544 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
4770545 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
4770546 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
4770547 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
4770548 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
4770549 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
4770550 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
4770551 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
4770552 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
4770553 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
4770554 but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
4770555 and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward
4770556 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first
4770557 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him

4770564 verse observes dryden calmly is not the effect of sudden thought but this hinders not that sudden thought may be represented in verse a heavy stress on the element of mystery in art can hardly escape an ultimate stress on the artist himself and his process because if the theorist stresses the mystery of the work itself he is saying in effect that he cannot understand why it is a good work and this is close to saying that he does not understand that it is a good work true nobody has ever yet completely demonstrated any such understanding yet criticism and theory do drive toward understanding or they drive toward nothing at all

4770572 several times a year articles arrive called where are our war poets the answer not usually given is under your nose for war poets are not a new kind of being they are only peace poets who have assimilated the material of war it is unfortunate from the military point of view that war poetry is not necessarily patriotic when the articles ask where are the war poets they generally mention rupert brooke because he wrote some stirring sonnets and was killed in action though his poems were mostly nostalgic or amorous they want real war poets and a roll of honour
4770573 although there is very little new being written there is a vast amount of old being forgotten blake told us to drive our harrow over the ones of the dead
4770574 to jot down nostalgic dreams to flaunt a private damnation a delphic obscurity will no more make a rimbaud than an arrangement of dots would produce a seurat

4770576 there is something which has never been seen yet and which to all appearances never will be and that is a little town which isnt divided into cliques where the families are united and the cousins trust each other where a marriage doesnt start a civil war and where quarrels about precedence dont arise every time that a service a ceremony a procession or a funeral are held where gossip and lying and malice have been outlawed
4770577 past present and future exist in the arts simultaneously according to our courage or to our inclination we are all free to choose
4770578 what shall we choose a lifetime of pleasure immune from all the horrors of life except the one supreme horror of finding that life has by passed us and of finding it out only at the last moment when the unused potential of the mind is about to crumble into dust or a lifetime of belonging to the age fighting its battles espousing its causes wallowing in its optimism or its fashionable pessimism enjoying its respect and gathering its praise
4770579 there is always the other life which does not hide from time behind the skirt of pleasure nor underneath the umbrella of duty ignore it but which defies it and defies it intelligently to triumph in the end over time this is the life of those artists who are ahead who so identify themselves with reality the reality of the spiritual discoveries of their age that they achieve a complete timelessness in their art and through the intensity of their vision become identified with the future

4770786 i wasnt able to see right at the beginning of the fight youre blind how much does that affect you i dont know its not good
4770787 but i think were going to be ok were still seeing with the doctors what the final results going to be on that
4770788 thats the worst part about the fight i felt in great shape
4770789 you get caught early on and theres nothing you can do about it you make do with the cards youre dealt sometimes we got dealt some pretty bad ones early on we tried to stay in the fight and do what we could do
4770790 what do you expect thats kind of his shtick its what he does i figure thats what everybody expected from him
4770791 i didnt really have any words with him before the bout ive never even really met the guy
4770792 ive been around this sport for years ive never really done any trash talking or anything like that before a match i dont know where that came from
4770793 i never even had a discussion with the ufc about anything
4770794 ill be honest you bringing that up is the first ive heard of it
4770795 ive got some other stuff kind of working on the backburner right now were going to go do some of that stuff and just see how everything pans out
4770796 ive got some acting possibilities im going to try to do some acting a little bit
4770797 im trying to get back to training and do some other things with training
4770798 its just disappointing when you kind of feel like youve done everything right and you get some bad luck early on ive got to clean that out a little bit and get refocused well be back to business before too long i imagine
4770799 we took the best lesnar could give us for 15 minutes and he couldnt finish it
4770800 i dont know what else hes going to bring to the table to finish me off
4770801 we took his best shot and went on from there id love for him to take one of mine and well see how it goes

4770810 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4770811 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4770812 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u

4770822 the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4770823 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4770824 above all it seems that the americans changed their opinion as a result of the situation in the caucasus
4770825 it sends a signal to moscow that people are not going to be intimidated
4770826 it is this kind of agreement not the differences between the us and russia over south ossetia which could lead to a real rise in the tension in russian american relations
4770827 poland by deploying the missiles is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4770828 the threats from russia create unease i take them very seriously
4770829 poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4770830 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4770831 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4770832 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4770833 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4770834 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4770835 but in order to get to that point there really does have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests are not protected
4770836 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4770837 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4770838 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4770839 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4770840 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4770841 it can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of polish russian talks this agreement can be seen as a purely anti russian agreement
4770842 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
4770843 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

4770865 myself and the players get to come and work on what didnt go right last weekend
4770866 the fans were sort of a little bit powerless in that position so it would have been a tough week for them
4770867 im really pleased and obviously thankful for the people that did turn up tonight

4770882 the reason people bought here is because of the view
4770883 weve got a huge investment so we cant afford to pick up and move
4770884 we need more electricity in this country and wind provides a very good balance to what we have right now
4770885 i understand why people would be concerned and want to explore these issues but beauty is in the eye of the beholder for some people they represent a new era where we are getting smarter about energy choices
4770886 these landmen with leases come into the area like termites and by the time they come to the surface its almost too late but we found out about it soon enough
4770887 thats why we need to stop people from leasing for the wind turbines theres a whole group theyll have to cross and were united

4770907 retinal detachments from bruchs membrane ceases immediately any function of the retina in this area traditionallly this blindness is put down to the interruption of nutrition to the cones which should follow from the choroid it is unknown why this blindness occurs immediately together with the detachment and why the reattachment of the retina onto bruchs membrane leads to an instant restoration of sight
4770908 the rods were inserted deeper into the pigment epithelium than the cones and passsed by the cluster of melanin granules at the end of the cones
4770909 as regards the physical effect it has been suggested that light scattered by the melanin granules b low 1968 may pass backward through the outer segments of the photoreceptors where standing light waves may be produced under certain circumstances b low 1968 the present observation that melanin granules are situated at the end of the cones but not at the end of the rods suggests that passage of light from the melanin granules backwards through the outersegments of the photoreceptors is possible only in the cones not in the rods
4770910 electrodynamics of visible light interactions with the vertebrate retinal rod
4770911 these effects combine to generate a complex optical standing wave within the rod thereby creating a pattern of local intensifications of the optical field

4770916 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4770917 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4770918 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4770919 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4770920 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4770921 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4770922 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4770923 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4770924 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4770925 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4770926 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4770927 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4770928 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4770929 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4770930 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4770931 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4770932 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4770933 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4770934 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4770935 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4770936 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4770937 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish

4771032 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4771033 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771034 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4771035 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4771036 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771037 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4771038 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771039 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771040 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4771042 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4771043 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4771044 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771045 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4771046 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4771047 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4771048 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4771049 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison

4771058 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could

4771100 the mob being composed in the overwhelming main of men and women who have not got beyond the ideas and emotions of childhood hovers in mental age around the time of puberty and chiefly below it
4771101 one thus sees the world as a vast field of greased poles flying gaudy and seductive flags up each a human soul goes shinning painfully and with many a slip some climb eventually to the high levels a few scale the dizziest heights but the great majority never get very far from the ground there they struggle for a while and then give it up the effort is too much for them it doesnt seem to be worth its agonies golf is easier so is joining rotary so is fundamentalism so is osteopathy so is americanism
4771102 man comes into the world weak and naked and almost as devoid of intelligence as an oyster but he brings with him a highly complex and sensitive susceptibility to fear
4771103 man on the lower levels though he quickly reaches the limit of his capacity for taking in actual knowledge remains capable for a long time thereafter of absorbing delusions what is true daunts him but what is not true finds lodgment in his cranium with so little resistance that there is only a trifling emission of heat
4771104 politics under democracy consists almost wholly of the discovery chase and scotching of bugaboos the statesman becomes in the last analysis a mere witch hunter a glorified smeller and snooper eternally chanting fe fi fo fum it has been so in the united states since the earliest days the whole history of the country has been a history of melodramatic pursuits of horrendous monsters most of them imaginary the red coats the hessians the monocrats again the red coats the bank the catholics simon legree the slave power jeff davis mormonism wall street the rum demon the hell hounds of plutocracy the trusts pancho villa german spies hyphenates the kaiser bolshevism
4771105 the whole power of the government was concentrated upon throwing the plain people into a panic all sense was heaved overboard and there ensued a chase of bugaboos on a truly epic scale nothing like it had ever been seen in the world before for no democratic state as populous as the united states had ever gone to war before i pass over the details and pause only to recall the fact that the american people by the end of 1917 were in such a terror that they lived in what was substantially a state of siege though the foe was 3000 miles away and obviously unable to do them any damage
4771106 the sea sick passenger on the ocean liner detests the good sailor who stalks past him a hundred times a day obscenely smoking large greasy gold banded cigars in precisely the same way democratic man hates the fellow who is having a better time of it in this world such indeed is the origin of democracy and such is the origin of its twin puritanism
4771107 oscillates eternally between scoundrels or if you would take them at their own valuation heroes politics becomes the trade of playing upon its natural poltroonery of scaring it half to death and then proposing to save it
4771108 the vast majority of persons of our race have a natural tendency to shrink from the responsibility of standing and acting alone
4771109 the heritage of freedom belongs to a small minority of men descended whether legitimately or by adultery from the old lords of the soil or from the patricians of the free towns
4771110 justice in fact is always unpopular and in difficulties under democracy save perhaps that false form of so called social justice which is designed solely to get the laborer more than his fair hire
4771111 the democratic man can imagine and even esteem in his way certain false forms of liberty for example the right to choose between two political mountebanks and to yell for the more obviously dishonest but the reality is incomprehensible to him
4771112 whether it be called a constitutional monarchy as in england or a representative republic as in france or a pure democracy as in some of the cantons of switzerland it is always essentially the same there is first the mob theoretically and in fact the ultimate judge of all ideas and the source of all power there is second the camorra of self seeking minorities each seeking to inflame delude and victimize it the political process thus becomes a mere battle of rival rogues but the mob remains quite free to decide between them
4771113 the politician is willing to embrace any issue however idiotic that will get him votes and he is willing to sacrifice any principle however sound that will lose them for him
4771114 we are dependent for whatever good flows out of democracy upon men who do not believe in democracy
4771115 democracy as a political scheme may be defined as a device for releasing this hatred born of envy and for giving it the force and dignity of law the puritans actual motives are a to punish the other fellow for having a better time in the world and b to bring the other fellow down to his own unhappy level the whole criminal law in namespace prefix st1 gt thus acquires a flavour of fraud it is executed by officers whose private prosperity runs in direct ratio to their reckless ferocity and the business is applauded by morons whose chief delight lies in seeing their betters manhandled and humiliated there is always a district attorney at hand to launch the prosecution for district attorneys are invariably men who aspire to higher office and no more facile way to it is to be found than by assaulting and destroying a man above the general level
4771116 he is not actually happy when free he is uncomfortable a bit alarmed and intolerably lonely he longs for the warm reassuring smell of the herd and is willing to take the herdsman with it
4771117 haste is necessary lest even the mob be shaken by sober second thought
4771118 it came into the world as a cure all and it remains primarily a cure all to this day any boil upon the body politic however vast and ranging may be relieved by taking a vote any flux of blood may be stopped by passing a law the aim of government is to repeal the laws of nature war becomes simply a device to end war the state takes on a transcendental potency democracy becomes a substitute for the old religion not vulnerable to logical attack
4771119 i have never encountered any actual evidence convincing to an ordinary jury that vox dei the proofs indeed run the other way
4771120 the true charm of democracy is not for the democrat but for the spectator try to imagine anything more heroically absurd it is based upon propositions that are palpably not true and what is not true as everyone knows is always immensely more fascinating and satisfying to the vast majority of men than what is true i enjoy democracy immensely it is incomparably idiotic and hence incomparably amusing does it exalt dunderheads cowards trimmers frauds cads then the pain of seeing them go up is balanced and obliterated by the joy of seeing them come down
4771121 it all rolls into one and nothing comes for free theres nothing you can hold for very long and when you hear that song come cryin like the wind it seems like all this life was just a dream

4771125 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4771126 this is a planning took where all things are going
4771127 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4771128 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4771129 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4771130 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4771131 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4771132 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4771133 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4771134 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4771135 oh god i hope an alien doesnt come in and get me
4771136 maybe i could look in the dresser mirror and imagine that it was a portal into another world
4771137 mccains a nutjob spent too much time in a tiger cage
4771138 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4771139 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4771140 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4771141 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4771142 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4771143 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4771144 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4771145 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4771146 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4771147 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4771148 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4771149 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4771150 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4771151 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4771152 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4771153 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4771154 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4771155 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4771156 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4771157 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4771158 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4771159 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4771160 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4771161 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4771162 a big thomas the tank model that makes noises and has little puffs of steam coming out of the funnel
4771163 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4771164 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4771165 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4771166 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4771167 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4771168 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4771169 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

4771173 when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4771174 he just has that rhythm hes in the zone when you get that way you kind of feel unstoppable
4771175 i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses
4771176 i just didnt make it my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics it just was one of those things that happened maybe i could have used some more training or more races
4771177 volgens de onderzoeker is het de taak van het televisiejournaal om mensen zo goed mogelijk te informeren over belangwekkende zaken

4771182 to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
4771183 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4771184 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4771185 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

4771191 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4771192 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4771193 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4771194 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4771195 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4771196 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4771197 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4771198 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4771199 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4771200 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4771201 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4771202 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4771203 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4771204 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4771205 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4771206 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4771207 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4771208 and mr newton was the first name we came up with we didnt go any further
4771209 part standup comedian part inspiration and part drill sergeant and that combination makes for such a great character
4771210 i loved the movie because it gives people who are not in our program a chance to see what really goes on
4771211 people who dont know about our program have no idea about the love the honesty the camaraderie thats here
4771212 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4771213 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4771214 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4771215 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4771216 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4771217 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4771218 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4771219 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4771220 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4771221 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4771222 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4771223 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4771224 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4771225 non cerco scuse siamo mancati in fase difensiva abbiamo fatto poco in attacco e non siamo stati brillanti
4771226 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4771227 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4771228 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4771229 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4771230 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4771231 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4771232 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4771233 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4771234 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4771235 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4771236 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4771237 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4771238 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4771239 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4771240 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4771241 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4771242 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4771243 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4771244 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4771245 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4771246 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4771247 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement
4771248 they loaded it onto the helicopters and took it straight away
4771249 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4771250 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalize their negotiations so that together they can work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4771251 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside the country await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations

4771257 we continue to have record months of fundraising this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before
4771258 which gives us plenty enough money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august

4771261 in the spring at the time when kings go off to war david sent joab out with the kings men and the whole israelite army
4771262 lets just get out of the house and do it
4771263 i need you to do something for me but i cant use you until you deal with this big hairy thing over here
4771264 but nawaz sharif and asif zardari are unelected theyre not just unrepresentative in that they dont hold seats in the parliament they have absolutely no mandate in
4771265 the rest of the coterie that wields power behind this administration the attorney general and the interior minister for instance also happen to be unelected
4771266 they serve and i use the term ever so lightly by appointment only some 170 million pakistanis have lived under military rule of law for nine years
4771267 musharraf stepping down from his army post has not changed that neither did the recent selections sorry i meant elections obviously
4771268 and what has this thriving democratic union accomplished it passed the national reconciliation ordinance an odious piece of legislation that wipes out 15 years worth of corruption cases against politicians suspiciously covering 11 years of
4771269 but they must have done more than that surely well all that really changed is that food inflation has accelerated oil subsidies have been cut gas prices have doubled and those pesky militants in the swat district the tribal regions have turned up the fighting
4771270 so what does the government do when its country appears to be tearing apart at the seams go on the attack impeach the tyrant
4771271 zardari is not an option sharif is not an option

4771276 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4771277 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4771278 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4771279 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4771280 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4771281 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4771282 nada nada es que no puedo olvidar la situaci n de la gente y tanta persecusi n por qu en el quich quisiera estar aqu y all al mismo tiempo los peri dicos nada dicen de las masacres tampoco la radio y televisi n todo el mundo calla pero lo que se est dando es espantoso

4771293 even if i were the most bearish man on earth i cant imagine buying puts 50 percent below the price with just over a week to expiration
4771294 its not even on the page of rational behavior unless you know something
4771295 when you buy 5 strikes puts when the stock is trading over 50 you either have to be manipulating or you have to have insider information
4771296 nobody in their right mind would buy that put unless you knew what was going down
4771297 he has to remain in prison until the new trial takes place
4771298 how can louisiana continue to imprison a 61 year old man after a federal judge has ruled that he shouldnt have been convicted in the first place
4771299 the state needs to move forward albert must be released
4771300 the mandate for release had been issued and i still remained on death row though i had no more conviction
4771301 i myself had to petition the state district judge and demand the constitution be followed and i be removed from death row some lawyers wont fight for their clients and the client has to fight for themselves like i did
4771302 say you were arrested in 1993 and the statutes mandated that you serve 75 percent of your sentence say the statutes were changed and or new statutes created so that the law mandates inmates serve 85 percent of their sentence by the time your release parole date is near the statutes have been changed again and since you were convicted so long ago and have been incarcerated through several changes in legal statutes no one remembers how the original law worked
4771303 punishment for crimes committed 35 years ago for political beliefs for religious beliefs and for leadership qualities are not legitimate penological interests
4771304 the attorney generals second in command john sinquefield who is helping to preside over the decision to continue fighting the case is implicated in some of the wrongdoings referred to in the magistrates june report

4771307 the rtbu has been arguing that these free shuttle services have placed an increased workload on the operators as they are exposed to a higher risk environment from operating through the busiest part of the cbd for extended periods of time
4771308 with the extension occurring towards the end of next year or early 2010 there is going to be further exposure to that high risk environment
4771309 we are basing this claim on the increased flexibility transadelaide are asking for and productivity that we believe we have delivered transadelaide
4771310 we apologise to the public for the disruption to services but it is now unavoidable
4771311 they want to remove conductors because its a free service
4771312 we have said who is going to handle wheelchairs or advise passengers who might be from out of town even if they are not selling tickets they are still performing a service role and other duties
4771313 it was amazing to see the possibilities that people could do with their bodies it was learning the impossible really
4771314 id been looking at it theology while i was doing my circus degree and there were a few reasons to study
4771315 the biggest one was i got very involved with multi faith and inter religious dialogue and working with people with other faiths and that really made me look more into my own faith
4771316 it was really like this is the real path of my life circus was good but it wasnt my mainstream
4771317 i have no regrets everyones just been so supportive it really feels like this is where im being called
4771318 i was often questioning where god wanted me in life and asking questions and looking around at different things
4771319 then as soon as id made the decision everything in my life seemed to fall into place
4771320 they love it they think its really exciting ive taught some of them some human pyramids and even if they cant do it they enjoy looking at it
4771321 there are many people out there in the world who are celibate because they have to be because of their circumstances in life
4771322 their partner dying or moving on and there are many people in really horrible situations were a bit of a reminder that some people had to live like that without a choice
4771323 these days many more young people train to be teachers nurses doctors or social workers and serve the people in that way
4771324 once these works were done by religious orders because fewer young people were able to go to university for professional training
4771325 we believe the anti corruption branch and ministerial investigation provisions are at a level they need to be
4771326 i am confident that there are provisions in place to deal with public officers who abuse their official position for private benefit
4771327 i am not ruling out further examination of any proposals that may improve the current provisions
4771328 he wants to be acquitted and set free on the basis his conduct was involuntary
4771329 an ambulance at one tree hill was directed where to park by the star force during his arrest
4771330 like many other people he may be vindicated by the use of dna evidence which was not available at the time of his trials
4771331 it will be crucial to have the cricket bat and have it tested
4771332 if we can establish mr radford suffered a concussion or that a blow to his head caused him to behave in an autonomic or unconscious state he would be entitled to be set free
4771333 the extreme interest in this case is in relation to the involuntariness involved and that a man who may be innocent has spent so long in jail
4771334 we also need to locate the nurse who treated mr radfords head injury at one tree hill and take a statement
4771335 we will be arguing he was struck with the bat and as a result suffered a concussion which put him into a dissociative state at the time of the shooting this caused his behaviour to be involuntary like someone sleepwalking or acting unconsciously
4771336 he drove to the petrol station and before he got out of his car there he was met at the drivers door by mr williams who opened the door and repeatedly punched the witness while he sat in the drivers seat
4771337 i am instructed that mr williams shouted at him that he wasnt to say anything to anybody that this was just a start and there would be more for him and his family undoubtedly and mr fowles understood it referring to the beating hed just received
4771338 he received threats and the threats were such that he paid what he could and then interest was demanded of him and every time that he paid more money was demanded and the situation for him simply spun out of control
4771339 what also played on his mind was the question of how steve williams apparently could have known he was first of all going to be at the holden hill magistrates court that morning and secondly of how he could have known he was to appear later that day for a questioning hearing at the acc
4771340 as far as mr fowles was concerned his appearance at the acc was supposed to be confidential that is what he understood but he was left in no doubt that mr williams was aware that the acc examination was occurring
4771341 your refusal to answer meant that the examination had to be adjourned indefinitely
4771342 this has resulted in opportunities to investigate serious organised crime being lost
4771343 the investigation in question related to but was not limited to illicit drug importation manufacture trafficking and supply
4771344 the only point that i actually believe is true in this post
4771345 geesh they spent all that money designing and studying those projects for nothing

4771349 procrastination isnt the problem its the solution so procrastinate now dont put it off
4771350 if theres anything unsettling to the stomach its watching actors on television talk about their personal lives

4771360 mit dem unterschied dass ich das heute gefahrlos tun kann
4771361 sie kann von mir nichts finden weil es von mir nichts gibt keine unterschrift keinen entsprechenden vermerk ich war nicht bei der stasi
4771362 bei den gespr chen mit meinen mandanten w hrend eines ermittlungsverfahrens in der untersuchungshaft wenn vernehmer von der stasi dabei waren und bei etwa drei gespr chen mit dem angeblichen staatsanwalt lohse der in wirklichkeit der stasi offizier g nther lohr war
4771363 die behauptung ist eine unversch mtheit wenn f r u erungen von abgeordneten im parlament nicht die straflosigkeit gelten w rde w rde ich gegen ihn vorgehen
4771364 bei mir soll alles f lschung sein auch die operative personenkontrolle die die stasi gegen mich einleitete nachdem sie den im vorlauf wegen nichteignung einstellte

4771367 prophesy to these bones and say to them dry bones hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says to these bones i will make breath enter you and you will come to life

4771369 son of man these bones are the whole house of israel they say our bones are dried up and our hope is gone we are cut off therefore prophesy and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says o my people i am going to open your graves and bring you up from them

4771371 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4771372 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4771373 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4771374 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4771375 phelps time was 50 58 seconds while cavic finished oh so close behind in 50 59 seconds the medal is serbias first since montenegro separated from the balkan nation in 2006
4771376 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4771377 i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4771378 hes going to win eight gold medals but then rumors would have started that it wasnt fair
4771379 cavic said he wouldnt have filed the protest if it were up to him
4771380 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4771381 but im taking what i got and im very happy
4771382 i almost won the gold and if you ask me the clock does not lie
4771383 if you ask me it should be accepted and we should move on
4771384 ive accepted defeat and theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4771385 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4771386 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4771387 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4771388 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4771389 cavic became an inspiration among serbs who object to losing kosovo an ethnic albanian dominated territory which many serbs consider the historic cradle of their nation kosovos independence has been recognized by the united states and most european union nations
4771390 the best learning happens in real life with real problems and real people and not in classrooms

4771392 all in all the project would have a very positive effect on all age groups in ipswich we know lawyers plumbers builders who can help us but just need the money to do it all
4771393 i would say to people that they should pull ipswich into their hearts this is their town and they do have a say into what positive and negative issues there are here we need everyone to embrace this project
4771394 there is a covenant for the building which says it needs to be a nightclub restaurant or public house if the prospective purchaser wants to change this they would be able to approach us to discuss the alternatives there are no guarantees this would be changed

4771399 k nnen sie uns zu begin die hauptbestandteile einer reifenkonstruktion beschreiben
4771400 ich gehe da nat rlich nicht gro ins detail aber die basis eines reifens besteht aus einer karkasse das ist die innere struktur des reifens au en befindet sich der gummi teil soweit zur lauffl che die reifenw nde sorgen f r kontakt mit dem boden
4771401 alle diese teile k nnen in ihren eigenschaften variieren je nach dem mit welchem kurs und mit welchem grip niveau wir es zu tun haben was auch immer passiert die entwicklung endet nie alle teile werden verbessert und modifiziert die fahrer wollen immer mehr haben wir arbeiten also best ndig an der reifenentwicklung weiter
4771402 das vergangene jahr war schwierig f r michelin wie verl uft die saison 2008 aus ihrer sicht
4771403 der wettbewerb ist sehr fordernd und nie kann etwas als absolut perfekt bezeichnen wie ich es schon gesagt habe es gibt immer viel zu tun um verbesserungen zu finden dieses jahr ist es zudem schwierig weil der titelkampf sehr eng ist und es sehr schwierig ist f r gro e unterschiede zu sorgen deswegen suchen wir konstant nach neuen l sungen
4771404 wenn man sich die meisterschaft ansieht haben wir eine sehr enge schlacht zwischen stoner rossi dani pedrosa und sogar jorge lorenzo der ja auch noch da ist alle fahrer k nnen einen hervorragenden job erledigen und wir m ssen uns weiterhin anstrengen vor dem start ist nichts entschieden
4771405 was denken sie ber die momentanen reifen regel nderungen welche die anzahl an reifen begrenzen die verwendet werden k nnen und die reifenwahl am donnerstag f r das restliche wochenende kritisch machen
4771406 es ist nicht einfach und die wahrheit ist dass diese regelungen unseren job etwas kompliziert gemacht haben gleichzeitig ist es wahr dass wir nun mehr reifen haben als vergangenes jahr fr her hat jeder diese regeln kritisiert weil sie neu waren und man nicht unbedingt den durchblick hatte
4771407 jetzt haben sich alle daran gew hnt und man kann mit ihnen gut arbeiten die regeln sind nun mal so und wir m ssen sie akzeptieren bislang sind dieses jahr die dinge nicht allzu schlecht verlaufen obwohl es auch wahr ist dass unsere arbeit einen gr eren weitblick und eine bessere koordination mit dem team den fahrern und michelin erfordert damit am donnerstag vor dem rennen die richtige entscheidung getroffen erden kann
4771408 die genaue reifenwahl die am donnerstag vor einem grand prix gef llt wird ist jedes mal beinahe ein staatsgeheimnis k nnten sie uns dennoch eine beschreibung dessen geben wie die reifen ausgew hlt werden
4771409 wir sehen uns ein paar unterschiedliche reifen mit verschiedenen karkassen und gummi komponenten an und machen die entscheidung vom wetter abh ngig ob wir ein sehr hei es wochenende haben werden oder ob es regnen wird etc dar ber hinaus treffen die michelin reifeningenieure und entwickler bereits in frankreich eine vorauswahl an m glichen reifen die f r die jeweilige strecke in frage kommen k nnten
4771410 was glauben sie wohin die reifenentwicklung der motogp gerade f hrt
4771411 nat rlich haben die reifen nichts mit denen zu tun die vor einem jahr benutzt worden sind weil es eine kontinuierliche forschung und entwicklung gibt weil sich die motorr der weiter entwickeln sind auch die reifenhersteller gezwungen sich weiterzuentwickeln
4771412 ich glaube dass sich der grip und die haftung in den kurven bereits drastisch verbessert haben und die dinge nun ganz anders sind als zu den zeiten wo ich angefangen habe die bikes sind vollst ndig anders auch sie haben sich weiter entwickelt das material wird also parallel verbessert
4771413 die elektronik hat das fahrverhalten verbessert besonders in schwierigen situationen und mit abgenutzten reifen haben diese elektronischen systeme gr ere anforderungen an die reifen
4771414 sie helfen dem fahrer die maschine zu kontrollieren und daher wird der reifen weniger beansprucht wenn er leistung bertragen muss davor hat der reifen all die power des motors abbekommen wenn der fahrer aufs gas gestiegen ist heutzutage erreicht ihn die leistung auf eine wesentlich kontrolliertere weise dank der elektronik
4771415 welches sind die kurse mit den h chsten anforderungen an die reifen und warum
4771416 am kritischsten ist phillip island die strecke ist besondert hart zu der linken seite des reifens und er sollte dort sehr steif sein das ist sehr streckenspezifisch zum beispiel deutschland auch sie bekommen einen kritischen faktor von allen strecken die neu asphaltiert worden sind wir wissen bei diesen kursen n mlich nie was uns erwartet dann kann es auch ganz neue strecken geben wie z b indianapolis in diesem jahr
4771417 welcher fahrer hat sie am meisten beeindruckt sei es durch den fahrstil sei es weil er genau verstanden hat wie die reifen sich verhalten werden
4771418 das ist schwierig zu sagen aber f r mich haben immer die fahrer die besten sensationen auf der strecke abgeliefert die mir die meisten informationen gegeben haben das waren zum beispiel valentino rossi und dani pedrosa
4771419 sie haben beide eine unterschiedliche arbeitsweise ganz anders als viele andere das hei t nicht dass den anderen die notwendige sensibilit t fehlen w rde es ist aber tatsache dass diese beiden wesentlich mehr informationen generieren
4771420 k nnen sie kurz beschreiben wie sich die reifen seit den wilden 500er zweitakt zeiten bis zu den kraftvollen 990er viertakt zeiten bis zu den anspruchsvollen 800ccm motorr dern entwickelt haben
4771421 die genaue entwicklung aufzuz hlen w re zu schwierig aber um mit den maschinen anzufangen diese entwickeln die leistung vollkommen unterschiedlich
4771422 die anforderungen an die reifen haben sich beim bergang von 500ccm zu 990ccm ver ndert und dann zu 800ccm in der 500er klasse haben wir uns seit dem aufstieg zu 990ccm sehr ver ndert nachdem alles von den motoren abh ngt die wahrheit ist dass es jedes jahr sehr gro e entwicklungsschritte gab
4771423 was sind dani pedrosas bevorzugte reifen in bezug auf seinen fahrstil und sein gewicht
4771424 dani pedrosa hat einen sehr fl ssigen fahrstil v llig anderes als das was die leute ber ihn aufgrund seines leichten gewichts denken er fragt immer nach recht harten reifen er hat auch die tendenz sehr sp t nach den reifen zu fragen
4771425 das liegt daran weil er es liebt zun chst an stabilit t zu gewinnen und er sich mit den reifen noch nicht besch ftigen m chte selbst wenn ein reifen nur ein wenig h rter ist hat er angst dass ihm dieser eine noch bessere rennperformance verschaffen k nnte und er ihn benutzen sollte wir verwenden im gegensatz zur allgemeinen annahme nicht die allerweichsten reifen
4771426 dani war dieses jahr nur mit dem konventionellen motor unterwegs sollte er wie teamkollege nicky hayden nach einem aggregat mit pneumatischen ventilen fragen was w rde sich f r die reifen ndern
4771427 nicky hayden sitzt bereits auf der neuen maschine und verwendet keine anderen reifen daher denke ich dass es keinen gro en unterschied geben k nnte auf diesem level sind zwei motoren sehr hnlich und mit den kilometern die nicky mit der neuen maschine unterwegs war konnten wir noch keine speziellen entwicklungsschritte einschlagen

4771441 our resolution does not contain the way serbia sees the unilateral declaration of independence
4771442 we dont want to put countries of the world in a situation to vote for our point of view or for anybody elses point of view we ask the support for this thing to be referred to the international court of justice
4771443 i can say that serbia is going to accept any opinion that comes from the icj
4771444 i think this is the way forward that has to be supported by opponents and supporters of kosovos independence alike

4771479 when i took that last stroke i thought i had lost
4771480 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure that the 1 was next to my name
4771481 thats when i sort of let my roar out one one hundredth of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport pretty cool
4771482 is the most difficult loss you can have especially at the olympics
4771483 its possible i would have loved to share that gold medal but ill take a silver im very comfortable with that
4771484 i know i had a long finish and phelps had a short finish
4771485 it was evident from the video that one was stroking and one was gliding
4771486 i raced as hard as i could tried my best and my hand touched the wall first
4771487 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4771488 i had to take my goggles off to make sure there was a one next to my name im at a loss for words
4771489 its a complete miracle im here i wish id won a gold medal but ill still take a silver im comfortable with that
4771490 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4771491 a lot of people said it was impossible to tie or break that record
4771492 i came here to win as many races as i could get as many personal bests as i could i have seven medals out of seven so far
4771493 it would be good for the sport if he lost lets be honest its true
4771494 its good to lose sometimes i know because ive lost a lot theres no doubt in my mind hes the best is he the best here i dont know

4771506 first came the class action lawsuit followed by state attorneys general using the power of their office in connection with private plaintiff lawyers to pursue such lawsuits millions of dollars from ensuring settlements poured into state coffers
4771507 but trial lawyers bar associations and many of the attorneys general say there is nothing to reform that those multi million or in some cases multi billion dollar lawsuits are an act of reform itself
4771508 when an attorney general sues a drug maker or mortgage company or even a software giant they say they do so to reform those businesses that have made their billions in unethical or fraudulent ways
4771509 paying millions to settle huge lawsuits has a way of getting a major corporations attention
4771510 but the house is clearly divided when it comes to attorneys general
4771511 some of the most aggressive attorneys general past and present prominent names such as floridas bill mccollum new yorks eliot spitzer californias bill lockyer and west virginias darrell mcgraw are the ones facing the most criticism for their twitchy litigious trigger fingers and the class action lawsuits they file
4771512 the fundamental concern for taxpayers tort reform lawyer amber taylor said if the contracts are not subject to an open public bidding process is that the state is potentially getting a poor price for legal services

4771517 teams dont even make offers until hours before the deadline and in many cases minutes before the deadline
4771518 this deadline creates a major administrative problems and it completely for most draft picks removes almost in its entirety the negotiation process
4771519 obviously being 21 years old this is the first of this type of experience for me it was different im extremely excited to be a giant and i cant wait to get started
4771520 we were extremely competitive trying to sign him we offered a major league contract
4771521 we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were very disappointed
4771522 bob nutting has made a commitment to provide the club with the tools and resources necessary to return the pirates to the greatness that this organization has achieved so often in its rich history
4771523 he has further demonstrated that commitment by his active involvement throughout this process and by providing us with the significant dollars necessary to sign pedro alvarez
4771524 they told me that jasper was still healthy but just couldnt use his back legs so i thought why not just give it a try and it works perfect
4771525 i wouldnt even think about it because this dog means so much to me
4771526 jasper has been of great companionship to me and helped get me through hard times with my wife and i appreciate that so much
4771527 when we put jasper in the wheelchair he didnt have any hesitation about walking because hes so fearless
4771528 i remember when he was trying to chase a bird and he flipped over so i had to go and turn the cart over for him
4771529 bernard was terribly distressed about the pup and knew it would be a lot of work but hes done a marvelous job
4771530 his actual sentence was six years six months which was halved by the court because he pleaded guilty back on may 12
4771531 the fine was imposed as a financial compensation for the family of the victim
4771532 he looked very cool as he has done in previous court appearances here in thailand and when the sentence was read out he just simply said ok which was typical of his manner in the court proceedings here in thailand
4771533 poor conditions poor ventilation its very hot here in thailand so he wont have a good time during his 3 years and 3 month sentence
4771534 there was concern about it but in actual fact this is just the first step for christopher neil he did enter a guilty plea
4771535 its a huge global problem where you have western individuals especially hardcore pedophiles who are coming to this country and generally we would have to say that there is impunity around what they are doing for many many reasons
4771536 the answer is mr neil should do the time where he committed the crime that is hes chosen to come to a region where children are highly vulnerable where there are high levels of poverty and where this crime is easy to commit therefore when youre caught doing this crime you should rest in this community to serve your time
4771537 right now civility is a losing battle its easy to demonize from a distance when people sit behind a screen they lose all civility one of my three life goals is to help restore civility to civilization
4771538 faith is simply a worldview a person who says he puts his faith on the shelf when hes making decisions is either an idiot or a liar its entirely appropriate for me to ask what is their frame of reference

4771540 i dont care what your faith is as long as you have faith
4771541 this year we are particularly excited about our expanded involvement in the olympus us open series

4771543 yield the microphone to each other and park the arrogance long enough to listen
4771544 it shows that no matter what you set your mind to anything can happen
4771545 i saw so many quotes saying its impossible to duplicate that it wont happen but bob bowman phelps coach is the one who helped me to really dream about anything bob and i have gone through a lot together and its all paid off
4771546 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4771547 we didnt want them to go to sleep feeling like something was lost and they didnt have a chance
4771548 although the rules dont allow for team officials to watch video footage we did give them the opportunity to see for themselves after the competition the serbian team was very satisfied and agreed with the decision by the referee
4771549 when i did chop that last stroke i really thought it cost me the race
4771550 i ended up making the right decision trying to take a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first turned out to be in my favor
4771551 in that situation its the lesser of two evils either youre going to glide or take half a stroke
4771552 he did a much better job taking half a stroke
4771553 one one hundreth of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4771554 its a complete miracle to me that i am here

4771563 if one is to accept the basic principles of equality that feminism advances then one must accept that women like men are capable of the entire range of human action and experience from the summits of artistic creativity and human compassion to the depths of debased violence and evil
4771564 in exceptional circumstances only killing in response to words and conduct which caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged

4771567 although the ending is unsurprising henry poole remains an interesting character he behaves reprehensibly at times yet his difficulty with faith resonates perhaps salvation can be found on a cracked stucco wall in the middle of southern california perhaps not but the films point that we will all keep looking is well taken

4771587 we actually used the words like a school yard race just go race because you love to race and you hate to lose and go race the girl you love to race she loves to race margaret and we knew that would be her toughest competitor

4771600 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out

4771671 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4771672 the head of our state has made it clear that the georgian side appearing in the future as peacekeepers is now after what has happened unacceptable to south ossetia
4771673 the russian president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4771674 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4771675 the document signed by the georgian president differs from the one which was agreed
4771676 it totally omits the introductory part saying that these principles are supported by russia and france and calling on all sides to sign them

4771694 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4771695 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4771696 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4771697 everybody needs to get loose this song is a tango
4771698 there are some people who live in a dream world and there are some who face reality and then there are those who turn one into the other
4771699 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4771700 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4771701 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4771702 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4771703 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4771704 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4771705 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4771706 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4771707 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4771708 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people
4771709 the album is now on its way to get mastered which should be completed by this weekend overall we are more then happy with the results with neil kernons help i believe we have made a truly heavy thrash metal album that will definitely make a statement in the metal world working with neil was a blast as he is a man of many interesting stories and insight i feel confident that piledriver will be working with neil again on future releases spending five days in chicago was quite a good experience as we met a lot of great people and lots of metalheads we ended our stay in chicago at the famous kumas corner burger joint we had heard many stories of this place and it didnt disappoint good food and awesome metal tunes were played as for shows our next show is october 13th with overkill at the opera house in toronto well thats all for now lots of work in the meantime including booking a tour of europe for 2009 lots of countries to hit this time
4771710 the most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born that there is a genetic factor to leadership this myth asserts that people simply either have certain charismatic qualities or not thats nonsense in fact the opposite is true leaders are made rather than born
4771711 churches are filled with those who have known christ for decades and still need a bib a high chair and want daddy to do open wide here comes the airplane tricks with the fork before shoving it into their mouths i try to serve up the word hot and fresh every single sunday but if you refuse to apply it study your bible and pray some during the week join a small group and dig deeper with others if you refuse to bring it back to your mouth i cant help you get your own fork and learn to feed yourself stop burying your hand in the dish and spitting out every thing that doesnt give you a spiritual sugar high eat some vegetables serve pray practically apply the bible to your life
4771712 ive heard it you have too christians saying i just want to be fed
4771713 today as christians we have way more information than we could ever apply
4771714 in reading through the scriptures i have found that jesus strongest words of rebuke were for the deep the professional religious people of the day if deep is being a part of the group that knows tons about the bible but missed jesus then i dont want to be affiliated with them give me jesus christ crucified risen and who will one day return not another bible study on the weight of the ark of the covenant
4771715 ive always felt troubled by phrases such as i need to be fed or i need meat when referring to spiritual growth and not just because theyre usually meant to be critical of a pastors content but i could never see this thinking in scripture paul uses feed and meat in terms of where he expects christians to be in their maturity but its never used by people to demand something
4771716 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
4771717 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
4771718 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
4771719 im amazed how quickly it comes together when someone applies the right pressure in the right place
4771720 i understand these things take time and i understand there are other families that have bigger issues but it seems like it would be an easy thing to re issue the check
4771721 well get back with you it just seems like everyone i spoke with about this didnt want to be bothered they smiled on the phone but i would never hear back from them i didnt get any results i was frustrated and eventually became angry
4771722 im amazed how quickly it comes together when someone applies the right pressure in the right place
4771723 hopefully our request to the constitutional court will be granted just in france a death sentence can be carried out by a beheading
4771724 i had one fish at 9 a m and finally gave up everything i was doing and started over then i got into the right little stretch and put three good ones in the boat and had my limit by noon then i just drove around the lake looking for stuff to fish the next two days
4771725 i found a few areas that look like places i need to fish
4771726 i dialed into a little bit of a pattern today
4771727 im trying to keep an open mind they were a little different than how i caught them yesterday yesterday i caught a couple deep and today i caught a couple semi deep and a couple shallow
4771728 i can tell you i wont be fishing a shaky head rig
4771729 i felt like i could scratch and claw a few
4771730 i could just feel that it wasnt going to take much to make the cut

4771769 das kann sein ja das ist eine durchaus interessante perspektive es setzt aber das bekenntnis der gemeinsamkeit voraus wichtig sind gemeinsame pr sentationen man muss zeigen dass man etwas gemeinsam will denn der beginn der krisenhaften entwicklung war ja dass gusenbauer in der pressestunde seine steuerideen verbreitet hat das war ein erpresserischer akt gegen ber der vp so geht man in einer partnerschaft einfach nicht miteinander um
4771770 selbstverst ndlich das ist doch klar schauen wir zur ck die jahre 2000 bis 2006 waren erfolgreiche jahre f r sterreich die volkspartei war in den ersten beiden dieser jahre nicht erster 2002 wurden wir erster und auch dieses mal trete ich an um erster zu werden das ist mein ziel
4771771 durch die vielen m glichen konstellationen muss es auch in sterreich denkbar sein eine stabile regierung mit drei partnern zu bilden aber auch andere noch flexiblere formen sind m glich
4771772 ja definitiv denn strache geht einen kurs der nicht gut f r sterreich ist der strache kurs ist ein schwerer schaden f r das land also nicht mit jemandem der sterreich in eine sackgasse f hrt

4771782 theres a lot of anxiety because of the budget impasse
4771783 the state doesnt have the constitutional authority to issue paychecks employees are understandably concerned
4771784 any employee can have legitimate reasons to be out but we cant take lightly an employee that didnt show up at work without prior approval or that didnt have a legitimate reason to be out
4771785 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4771786 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4771787 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4771788 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4771789 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4771790 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4771791 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4771792 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4771793 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4771794 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4771795 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4771796 cavic said it would be good for me and good for swimming if he won
4771797 im at a loss for words i had no idea the race was that close i was lucky enough to get my hands on the wall first

4771805 play is a childs work said elana tenhuisen child life director at childrens hospital
4771806 thats how they learn about the world that theyre involved in
4771807 bunny suits before an operation just like the surgeons do
4771808 the point is familiarity and control and mastery said tenhuisen
4771809 that they have the opportunity to overcome and figure it out on their own
4771810 ill show a 2 year old the anesthesia mask before they go in so they can feel it and play with it said candy nyce director of the department of child life at st christophers hospital for children which like childrens hospital has had a formal program for more than 50 years
4771811 kids usually think its a lot worse than the reality said nyce
4771812 child life has become the widely accepted if still obscure term for a group of certified specialists trained in psychology child development recreational therapy and other fields

4771819 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case he saiid

4772031 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4772032 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4772033 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4772034 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now

4772038 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4772039 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish

4772051 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race

4772124 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4772125 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women

4772154 all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4772155 it was a near perfect laboratory test for how the two nominees for president would respond to an international emergency
4772156 a couple of days later mr obama strengthened his condemnation of the russians and withdrew his admonition to the georgians but then betrayed the soft weak reflexes that characterize the leftist wing of the democratic party to which he belongs the answer to this blatant and brutal violation of georgian sovereignty was to anyone alert the united nations

4772193 we want to showcase our fine products and be 100 within the rules and the law
4772194 if those parties prove to be a problem then we can revisit it when we do the ethics rules next year
4772195 due to the very late end to the primary season
4772196 had the effect of making people more thoughtful and more careful
4772197 but at the end of the day the application and interpretation of those rules may allow a fairly significant amount of entertainment at most of these events

4772206 my next coming would be the definition of what samini is this is gonna be the beginning of the real samini journey my first two albums dankwansere and samini are just introductions to what i can do
4772207 this is to encourage my fans to know their roots
4772208 this time i will also be touching on mother earth and agriculture to further encourage ghanaians to go into farming
4772209 when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4772210 he just has that rhythm hes in the zone when you get that way you kind of feel unstoppable
4772211 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4772212 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4772213 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4772214 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4772215 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4772216 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4772217 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4772218 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4772219 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4772220 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4772221 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4772222 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4772223 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4772224 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4772225 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4772226 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4772227 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4772228 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4772229 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4772230 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4772231 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4772232 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after
4772233 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4772234 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4772235 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4772236 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4772237 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4772238 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4772239 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4772240 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4772241 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4772242 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4772243 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4772244 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4772245 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4772246 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4772247 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4772265 its really a fight for the soul of the profession
4772266 the vast majority of military psychologists know the ethics code and know exactly what they can and cannot do
4772267 this is a fight about individual psychologists behavior and we should keep it there
4772268 a principled stance against our nations policy of using psychologists to oversee abusive and coercive interrogations
4772269 it is consistent with the a p a ethics code for psychologists to serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information gathering processes for national security related purposes

4772272 the average 15 year old girl sends 100 text messages a day
4772273 altruistic investment yields selfish results and does so in such a disproportionate manner that the drive toward altruistic behavior is very strongly reinforced
4772274 this initiative seems to raise more questions than answers and that i believe is mr rudds intent he wants to connect the classroom to the world beyond and laptops are his trojan horse once theyre in the door theres no choice but for a curriculum rethink and for teachers to re train that can only result in a real education revolution

4772292 in the early 1990s i predicted that vr would become the standard interface metaphor for computers by the 21st century did i get that right it seems not after all we still use windows and mice as standard the interaction paradigm just as we did back in 1990 yet if we can draw anything from the recent and somewhat surprisingly successful introduction of the nintendo wii it s that vr did arrive is pervasive and has become a dominant interface metaphor just not on the computer desktop vr isn t about head mounted displays although it might have seemed so fifteen years ago vr is about bringing the body into contact with the simulated world nintendo with its clever cheap attractive and highly functional wiimote has done just that they ve done what decades of other researchers and engineers failed to do they ve brought us into the game so predictions might come to pass but rarely do they come in the form imagined but every so often when you step up to the plate you connect completely and knock one out of the park

4772299 craigslist does have a login capability so it can potentially record each of the interactions users have through the system it could collect data about the quality of the trust interactions users experience on craigslist and use this information to annotate all of the postings on the system in short every posting on craigslist could be accompanied by metadata which allows users to have some basic sense of the trustworthiness of the other participant in a given transaction with each successive transaction craigslist could begin to model an emergent digital social network

4772301 the diet was about 600 calories a day and we all had diarrhoea in addition we had severe epidemics of typhoid diphtheria infections jaundice and sand fly fever with more than 300 cases of pitting oedema above the knee to cope with this we had a ramshackle hospital some aspirin some antacid and some skin antiseptic

4772306 another issue which keeps iraq backward is administrational corruption iraq must overcome corruption to progress
4772307 in 2004 there was no investment budget in 2005 the investment budget was 3 billion in 2006 it was 11 billion and in 2007 was 12 billion
4772308 in the years before 2008 less than half the investment budget was spent because of the security issue
4772309 some ministries have projects in unsecured areas or disputed areas or not yet ready areas
4772310 moreover the local governments and the provincial councils lack experience needed to implement many projects
4772311 i think the main reason is the lack of big projects and the absence of big companies another issue which keeps iraq backward is administrational corruption iraq must overcome corruption to progress
4772312 i think its absurd that were paying for the reconstruction in a country when right at the beginning of the war the bush administration assured the american people that iraqs reconstruction would be paid for by iraq and through its oil revenues
4772313 inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
4772314 as tax filing season begins in earnest sars has announced a ground breaking initiative that will see it channelling funds directly from taxpayers to corrupt government officials and organised crime bosses
4772315 save billions of rands that would otherwise have to be spent on completely futile law enforcement
4772316 it can get quite complicated blue collar versus white collar crime violent versus non violent work related versus random hit and run and so on for example a lot of people want to know if abductions count as deductions
4772317 if this administration could not accomplish these reconstruction goals with iraqi money how can they be trusted to be good stewards over american taxpayer dollars
4772318 only a collection of records that were not audited or effectively connected to one another
4772319 with oil now hovering around 125 per barrel about five times what it was five years ago and iraqs oil production at record levels sigir estimates that oil revenues for 2008 could exceed 70 billion
4772320 they certainly have the resources to invest in their infrastructure program
4772321 i think we ought to just take them at their word on that and focus on helping iraq carry out its own program funded by its own money
4772322 a lot of that money is going to be left unspent
4772323 given that was going on earlier this year and that we have this massive windfall occurring inevitably there has to be concerns about corruption with regards to those funds
4772324 anti corruption efforts in iraq u s and iraq take action but much remains to be done
4772325 this leaves future program investments vulnerable to wasteful spending ineffectiveness and inefficiency
4772326 get rid of the anytime soon and i would say encouraged
4772327 it could be a blessing it could be a curse
4772328 please be advised that the united states attorney for the western district of virginia has closed its criminal investigation file in this case
4772329 bowens office has been roiled by allegations of overspending and mismanagement
4772330 threatened to put hexes on employees and made inappropriate sexual remarks in the presence of staff members
4772331 was all about anonymous allegations that have been found to be without merit and dismissed
4772332 i would say im glad the system worked in this case that it reached the right result in finding these anonymous allegations to be specious and im glad that our organization continued to produce good work while this cloud hung over our head im glad its been removed and im glad that the integrity of the organization and of me personally has been substantiated through the process
4772333 anti corruption efforts in iraq u s and iraq take action but much remains to be done
4772334 this leaves future program investments vulnerable to wasteful spending ineffectiveness and inefficiency
4772335 moreover intimidation and threats continue to impede effective anti corruption efforts and current iraqi regulations continue to have a corrosive effect on the perception of iraqi commitment to aggressively address corruption

4772375 the government made a big song and dance about restoring the pier to its former glories but it seems as if they didnt do their homework properly
4772376 the whole structure is falling down and theyre going to have some tough decisions to make the government either blow out the budget to do the job properly or look into ways of pulling the pier down and then face the embarrassment of that backflip
4772377 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
4772378 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4772379 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4772380 this is the first study that has followed children through puberty boys become less reactive but girls seem to increase in their reactiveness this implies there are some differences that happen in puberty in people with asthma

4772384 initially i was told it would keep the cancer at bay or halt it two weeks ago i had my tests and found out that my tumours had actually shrunk overall by 30 and maybe 50 in some it took a while for that to sink in a shrinkage of 30 was totally unexpected
4772385 i dont plan too far ahead but at the moment i feel im able to make plans for the near future
4772386 instead of the real story employees give acceptable reasons for why they are leaving such as a promotion an overseas move or changes in family circumstances
4772387 you dont take a slow dog from here to horsham unless maybe you like driving
4772388 the bell is now ready to ring and we are really pleased with this because this really responds to the demands of the public both in cambodia and abroad
4772389 we really hope that this fund withholding is a temporary delay
4772390 for the cambodians not to have been paid since the end of june is getting a little difficult
4772391 there has always been a group ready to be outraged that hasnt changed what does change is which group that is and that usually depends on who is perceived as vulnerable
4772392 so it used to be the depiction of women now its the depiction of children and disabled people with this film people seem to be upset about the retard aspect of it but no ones up in arms about african americans or australians so its about those broader perceptions of whos vulnerable

4772395 fmit invested the sum of 2 2 million lent to it by treasury corporation of victoria for the purpose of carrying out works with grange securities limited in investment instruments that are not approved investments under section 20 of the borrowing and investment powers act 1987
4772396 subsequently the investments have been affected by the failures in the us subprime mortgage market
4772397 as a result the current value of fmits investment has decreased by approximately 2 million i propose to make a determination that lower murray urban and rural water corporation be appointed to take over the whole of the functions powers and duties of fmit
4772398 we are kidding ourselves if we say we are living in a world without league tables
4772399 most parents would be able to survey across their suburb and put a view in about whether the school is a good school or a bad school often they are doing that off incomplete information because it is not available
4772400 matters of land ownership and land development reside with state and territory governments
4772401 settlement and city scale protection engineering management options likely to be required into the future
4772402 it was near home and when we first were looking for a school for my older son we thought that this was more suitable for him we did not want an overly big school where he could have been lost in the system
4772403 there is not a lot of information in the public domain about the schools academic results it is not readily available and thats something id be interested in
4772404 i did speak to the principal about academic results at the school and i was told that the school performed quite well in year 3 and 5 tests and that compared with other schools of the same type in terms of socio economics they do quite well
4772405 i just felt that it probably was not enough compare that to vce student results that are published on websites and thats not available for primary schools in a way that is understandable theyre only little
4772406 i think its remarkably accurate in terms of the political fix approach to government these days
4772407 there is that constant storyline of very exhaustive policy processes being totally trumped by a last minute scramble to fix problems
4772408 honor is what the loser says the winner has none of
4772409 if you want the answer to every economic question it is china
4772410 if we didnt have china we would be following the us path
4772411 if anything its economy is likely to accelerate once the olympics is finished because a lot of projects were put on hold to ensure there wasnt any disruptions to the games
4772412 by and large corporate australia is in pretty good shape
4772413 there has been a tendency to take the handful of companies that have run into trouble over the last six months and assume that applies to all companies thats like assuming all listed property trusts have the same problem centro had
4772414 there has been some reasons for the gloom and doom sentiment but below the surface people are still employed and i think they will realise fairly soon that they have worried unduly
4772415 are still coming out with profit growth and their outlook statements are cautiously optimistic
4772416 i believe this is a significant piece of information that you as a shareholder should be provided with prior to being asked to evaluate the merits of the resolutions put forward for consideration
4772417 it is regrettable that the board of nylex should be distracted by such unnecessary actions from a party that could have no ongoing financial investment in the company and yet seeks to control your company with no clear statement of its strategy to do things better than that implemented by the current board of which i am a member
4772418 banks with overseas operations are now seen as more risky than domestically focused local rivals
4772419 all the speculation about an interest rate drop has seemed to have had an immensely positive impact

4772421 the agent actually declared the reserve as 380 000 and opened the bidding there so it was on the market on the first bid

4772426 the reason why were still going to rallies and there is still a high turnout is that despite the ceasefire russians have not been honouring the ceasefire there is as we speak looting raping of women killing georgian men are being targeted and being disappeared it is the same tactics that have been used by russia in chechnya
4772427 we want the international community to pressure russia to stop
4772428 we all have families back there they cant move because the infrastructure is being destroyed
4772429 the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must

4772534 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics
4772535 i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4772536 but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4772537 what i said was what i was told and i checked it with other senior people in society and i was told this is true and i said i found it astonishing
4772538 but i was told by protestants that they were and i checked it and checked it and checked it

4772542 while i am quite aware of our mistakes both of commission and omission when i ask what is obvious now there is little consensus

4772671 the identification of rheb as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of cancer opens new avenues for the development of anti cancer therapies as rheb is an inherently druggable target indeed we are already testing such drugs alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics in faithful animal models
4772672 the key clinical implication is that rheb levels in tumor tissue could indicate patients that will benefit from relatively non toxic therapies with targeted drugs like rapamyicn or inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme

4772688 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner of nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4772689 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4772690 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want we are not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4772691 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed

4772714 you atienza yourself favored a citizens investigating team this to us is important so that we can help government clean itself of denr personnel who connive with loggers

4772784 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4772785 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4772786 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4772787 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4772788 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4772789 i would tell no one until i felt safe enough to share my dark past the years i was sexually abused from age 10 to 14 my resulting promiscuity as a teenager and finally at 14 my becoming pregnant

4772799 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4772800 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4772801 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners

4772845 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4773063 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today
4773064 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess

4773067 ci auguriamo non sia vero il sospetto che in italia stia rinascendo il fascismo sotto altre forme abbiamo definito indecente la proposta del ministro maroni sui bambini rom perch da un lato basta censirli aiutarli a integrarsi con la societ civile in cui vivono marginalizzati ma dallaltro bisogna evitargli la vergogna di vedersi marcati per tutta la vita come membri di un gruppo etnico considerato in potenza tutto esposto alla criminalit quella foto del bimbo ebreo nel ghetto di varsavia con le mani alzate davanti alle ss venuta alla memoria come un simbolo per questo il parlamento di strasburgo e il consiglio europeo hanno protestato

4773143 the facts are otherwise and government has been assiduously pursuing the matter as would be seen from the position brought out earlier and has in fact suggested further cross loc confidence building measures which will continue to be pursued with pakistan
4773144 as a part of the composite dialogue with pakistan and confidence building measures the government has taken the initiative to facilitate travel of persons across the loc along the srinagar muzaffarabad and poonch rawalakot routes to build further on these initiatives as early as on april 15 2005 it had been agreed with pakistan that truck services across the loc would also be initiated to promote trade

4773272 the option to export to video opens up a whole range of distribution options for real estate listings
4773273 and our clients now have options for distribution of shows that have nothing to do with listings were already seeing some very creative uses of real estate shows in the video format on flickr and youtube were very happy to see our first users gravitate so quickly and easily to new ways to use the product

4773281 its got all the bug fixes and performance enhancements that youd expect in a service pack but there are just so many new features in the net framework that were bringing to visual studio that we think sp1 is going to drive significant net adoption
4773282 this is a laundry list of things that didnt make it into this release for which theyve had a lot of customer demand since they released the ide
4773283 its exciting to see microsoft not only provide a roll up of performance and bug fixes but also deliver critical additional features that immediately address key customer scenarios
4773284 im happy to see that microsoft is delivering these kinds of features out of band so that we dont have to wait on the next major release i hope microsoft continues this pattern with future service pack releases
4773285 for developers the improvements to the wpf design time experience within visual studio have been greatly anticipated and welcomed
4773286 id recommend updating net framework 3 5 to sp1 just for that reason alone
4773287 most of the developers who have moved to wpf have been very happy with the core developer productivity
4773288 i agree that a lot of the marketing around wpf and a lot of the demos that you see look like eye candy but when the developers start working with whats essentially a declarative programming style around xml they realize that its a fundamentally better way to develop uis and i do believe that its the next generation approach to uis
4773289 id be the last person to recommend moving away from winforms just for the hell of it
4773290 but there are places where richer consumer experiences really matter and thats where wpf comes in
4773291 but user expectations for a rich experience appear to be rising
4773292 a lot of exciting stuff for the asp net space
4773293 the ado net entity framework allows you to have a higher level of abstraction over your data
4773294 so developers can deal with these high level concepts and do more model based programming starting with the database
4773295 the entity framework is the closest thing microsoft has to an orm toolset
4773296 it replicates what people like to do with hibernate linq to entities is as close as youre going to get to microsofts orm facility any time soon
4773297 to some extent microsoft is putting in place some real structural underpinnings that will let them do some nice things in the future around model view controller mvc architectures
4773298 when you look at the growing popularity of things like ruby on rails and spring you notice that one of the reasons developers like them so much is that theyre well established mvc architectures that you can program at a metadata level
4773299 and that lets you program against it in a whole new way
4773300 a combination of patterns and libraries that allows data stores to be exposed as a flexible data service
4773301 often in the most interesting application scenarios today youve got your data running on a server somewhere and you need some kind of web service to get at that data from a client machine
4773302 the new ado net data services allows richer and easier access to those services and in a more restful kind of way we can give you direct access to those web services and the platform takes care of the grungy stuff underneath
4773303 weve definitely been working on some of the normal service pack kinds of things in terms of making performance improvements and responding to customer feedback
4773304 but sp1 is about increasing developer productivity and lowering the barrier to good ideas with the net framework
4773305 in some ways were victims of our own success with the net framework
4773306 since the first release in 2001 weve added more features and more value and i think its come a long way but its gotten a little heavy as well
4773307 we think it gives us 80 percent to 90 percent of the features that client developers would want but in a much smaller package
4773308 were starting to see a lot more net projects that wed classify as enterprise scale
4773309 a lot of the features im seeing in sp1 are likely to make it easier for people to deploy net in bigger ways in broader senses in the enterprise
4773310 i guess thats a nice problem to have if youre microsoft
4773311 but this richness of choices is something that can create confusion among developers microsoft needs to continue to support developers to help them make the right choices among all the options they now have

4773342 the episcopal church wishes to affirm that it is for its part in full communion with all the churches in the anglican communion and that this fellowship of churches constitutes our most immediate family in the wider ecumenical witness of christian churches in particular we affirm that we are for our part in communion with the see of canterbury we recognize that every such affirmation must be met by mutual recognition for that communion to indeed be full and it is our prayer that the several churches of the anglican communion and in particular the see of canterbury and therefore the church of england will be able to affirm this state as well we in the episcopal church are clearly and painfully aware that some of our actions and decisions of the past several decades have been seen as disruptive of the common life of the communion most notably these have concerning the inclusion of women and gay and lesbian persons in the full life of the church including episcopal leadership we believe that these actions and decisions meager and slow in coming as they are are none the less the expression of profound faith and belief that we are living out our vocation as followers of the lord jesus christ and doing so guided by the holy spirit we realize that these actions decisions and beliefs have contributed to a time of confusion and limitations of relationships within the anglican communion we wish you to know that we stand ready to withdraw from the councils of the anglican communion for the sake of the fellowship we so strongly desire we seek your advice on the matter but unless otherwise persuaded we intend to propose at our next general convention that we voluntarily withdraw from active participation in the several agencies of the anglican communion until such time we might mutually deem appropriate we consider ourselves in full communion will all the churches of the anglican communion as currently constituted we wish it to be understood however that the continued assignment of bishops by other anglican churches to serve in the jurisdiction of this church will lead changes in the relationships we have with those churches we will be in a state of impaired relation with them the establishment of a new north american province recognized by some provinces as the legitimate anglican church in this jurisdiction will lead to a break in relationship with the sponsoring provinces in all this we remain committed to the vision of the anglican communion as a fellowship of churches and live in the hope that our relations with other member churches will be strengthened as we live out our particular vocations as churches and our collective hope of unity in christ jesus we look forward to continued good relations and full communion with many of the member churches of the anglican communion and in particular with the church of england

4773350 america is stuck to the iraqi tar baby and becomes more entrapped the more it struggles irans leverage inside iraq as i have warned for years gives the islamic republic room to bargain for its broader objectives there are simply too many adherents of militant islam to deal with the matter conveniently any solution today will be messy a confrontation postponed for another half dozen years might cost eight figures worth of lives the outlook is grim not least because the us state department is repeating in turkey the errors that helped bring islamist governments to power in iran and pakistan in advance of the november election the bush administration wants quiet in iraq and quiescence in the oil market and tehran can help with both that is why talks on irans nuclear program in geneva indicated a shift of the us policy toward iran on line with the baker hamilton recommendations of 2006 with all due respect to the uss military chief in iraq and now also central command head general david peterus diminished violence in iraq is not due entirely to the skill of american arms without iranian forbearance the troop surge would not seem as effective as i wrote in october 2005 the probable outcome is that washington will refrain from military action to forestall iranian nuclear arms developments while tehran will refrain from disrupting washingtons potemkin village in iraq in this exchange iran gives up nothing of importance what matters to washington at the moment is turkeys ability to create the appearance of progress in middle eastern diplomacy the middle east bears a strong comparison to europe in the years before world war i israel is the only player in the region with the perspicacity and power to stop the slide towards regional war the jewish state may not have the capacity to eradicate irans nuclear development program but it almost certainly has the means to set it back for a number of years if israel fails to act the near certain outcome will be a regional war on a scale dwarfing the iran iraq war on the 1980s

4773353 the physical environment is very different and processes have changed but employees know how to take care of patients that part remains seamless
4773354 hospitals are fast paced and employees are very busy so we had to be structured and communicate well we had over 40 activation teams
4773355 its more complex to relocate a hospital from an existing one because its so dependent on timing and planning
4773356 you want everything ready to go before patients arrive at the new facility but the existing hospital still remains in full operation
4773357 its not just packing boxes and moving goods there are service delivery requirements processes that have to be put in place for departments to work in their new space the traffic flow in the new environment has to be just right all in conjunction with operations
4773358 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4773359 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4773364 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4773365 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4773366 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4773367 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match

4773376 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it

4773392 everyone should do all in his power to collect and disseminate the truth in the hope that it may find a place in history and descend to posterity history is not the relation of campaigns and battles and generals or other individuals but that which shows the principles for which the south contended and which justified her struggle for those principles
4773393 indian it industry may be passing through a rough patch because of a slowdown in the us economy and high inflation rates but this stage will pass says a study the study elaborates india will continue to drive the global it market for the next few years in fact it will emerge as the second most important it industry in the world after the us in terms of revenue and employment
4773394 india will create the second largest it services labour pool after the us within the next seven to eight years thats not all domestic it industrys contribution to our gdp is likely to rise from 0 8 per cent in 2006 07 to 2 65 per cent by 2015 16
4773395 by 2015 2016 the number of professionals working in the it industry will grow ten fold from 2001 2002 and the total revenue will grow 22 times
4773396 since indias gdp is growing at 8 5 per cent per annum in real terms and 14 per cent in nominal terms by 2015 16 our gdp is likely to be 2 400 billion given this the it industry is likely to constitute 8 05 per cent of indias gdp

4773479 its about life and death about the next generation and whether there will be one if we make it ok for a society to slaughter innocent or vulnerable life people will treat us the same way
4773480 we will humble ourselves first of all because we have compromised as a church

4773487 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4773488 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4773489 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states
4773490 but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
4773491 is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4773492 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up

4773518 the crit is luckily not too technical and the major goal for the evening will certainly be to avoid the crashes and stay safe
4773519 nothing happened everyone rode well and the success of the evening is certainly that no one crashed
4773520 today was all about staying out of trouble and saving it for tomorrow
4773521 everyone is feeling good and we are expecting good things for tomorrow we hope the results will be just as good as on stage 2 but only better
4773522 i am feeling good and the guys are giving me fantastic support
4773523 darren rode amazingly yesterday in stage 2 which really made it possible for me to sit and relax at least as much as you can relax with three big climbs to tackle

4773575 in any of the emerging nations we all understand it is a necessity we need roads but how do we make them safe for the children pedestrians motorcyclists and things like that
4773576 well be at the united nations in march to beg them for help and make them really understand and recognise that this is a major problem and its just going to get worse

4773580 that was really fun that was really fun thank you

4773597 it would surprise the public and even the supreme court to know how utterly the science of global warming offers no evidence whatsoever on the central proposition

4773601 if the time series had begun a few decades earlier the rcords would indicate a cooling climate in the arctic
4773602 ian how much is the observed warming in the arctic
4773603 the data do not indicate a warming of the arctic the cooling after the maximum in the 1930s occurred during the time when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had increased markedly thus an increase in temperature could be expected the increase in temperature during the early 1900s is considered to be caused by increased solar irradiation 12
4773604 oh and tim it isnt sufficient to demonstrate an arctic uhi for a single township you need to demonstrate firstly that its widespread and secondly that its been decreasing
4773605 climate change and the greenhouse effect a briefing from the hadley centre
4773606 apropos the conversation above concerning the to me undoubted fact that human activity has released co2 into the atmosphere can anyone stand on a stack of bibles or ipcc reports and tell me precisely and exactly what percentage of the total that is just a figure and source will do
4773607 david duff does it ever occur to you that the earths atmosphere can handle a miniscule rise in co2 easily
4773608 increase your meds by the same fraction as the increase in atm co2 then get back to us on the effects
4773609 theres too little consistency in the methodology ice core analysis to really rely on them
4773610 all that the lag shows is that co2 did not cause the first 800 years of warming of the ice flows out of the 5000 year trend the other 4200 years of warming
4773611 it comes as no surprise that other factors besides co2 affect climate changes in the amount of summer sunshine due to changes in the earths orbit around the sun that happen every 21 000 years have long been known to affect the comings and goings of ice ages atlantic ocean circulation slowdowns are thought to warm antarctica also
4773612 theres too little consistency in the methodology ice core analysis to really rely on them
4773613 i put it to you dr ipcc that the victim may have been immune to cyanide and was really killed by some other poison unknown to science
4773614 natural variability would seemingly only be established by the historical record or failing the existence of such by proxy methods
4773615 all except the fabrication of the lethal dose of cyanide
4773616 also i am sure you can sympathise with if not agree with my confusion when i read the following from realclimate
4773617 most conservatives today under the age of about 45 arent so much conservative as they are contrarian
4773618 i put it to you dr ipcc that the victim may have been immune to cyanide and was really killed by some other poison unknown to science

4773624 we have our fingers crossed for her and we will work on it overnight and take a risk if we have to

4773626 destiny is still in our hands we always felt it would come down to our last game against china
4773627 well of course we really wanted to have gnr included in rb2 and paul degooyer our music guru and all around good guy at mtv worked directly with the gnr folks to make it happen everyone involved decided that itd be ultra fab to have something from the mysterious chinese democracy and axl himself took an interest and chose shacklers revenge very cool
4773628 fifpro is in disagreement with the decision of the drc and afan and fifpro have decided to assist mutu in his appeal against this strange decision
4773629 if mutu were an english player he wouldnt have paid any damages and he would only have been fired by his club this discrimination might affect the relationship between the european community and fifa
4773630 i didnt feel i deserved it at all i wanted to make it my own way
4773631 in these last couple of years weve worked so hard to get here so to make it and to win tonight was the best present
4773632 i think there is a bit of a shock here at how strong we are
4773633 everybody kept asking can they move up another gear have not they peaked too soon now we showed that we could move on and that is a bit of a shock to the other teams i think
4773634 i started putting my things away and then i remembered i said thats it its over and thats when it hit me
4773635 i reached the final and when you see the start list its still satisfying
4773636 i made a bad tactical choice its a race that went very very fast and there was no time to change tactics
4773637 im not going to die tomorrow but ive been doing this for 15 years and its nevertheless a big part of my life but tomorrow it will be something else i know that there are other things and i can express myself in other ways than through cycling
4773638 in a company you have rivals you have ways of working you have colleagues who perhaps arent nice to you people who encourage you you have bosses
4773639 i started putting my things away and then i remembered i said thats it its over and thats when it hit me
4773640 i reached the final and when you see the start list its still satisfying
4773641 i made a bad tactical choice its a race that went very very fast and there was no time to change tactics
4773642 im not going to die tomorrow but ive been doing this for 15 years and its nevertheless a big part of my life but tomorrow it will be something else i know that there are other things and i can express myself in other ways than through cycling
4773643 in a company you have rivals you have ways of working you have colleagues who perhaps arent nice to you people who encourage you you have bosses
4773644 our hitting is actually getting better and everyone is going with the flow
4773645 but were not thinking of medals were just thinking one game at a time coach keeps us focused on the next game not looking ahead
4773646 a home run at any time feels good at the olympics it feels spectacular
4773647 usually when we score its like the flood gates have opened you never know who is going to be the spark plug
4773648 well the album came out this year but wed been playing together with most of the original line up for about 2 years and there was a lot of pressure to do a new album right away and we took our time the band hadnt done a record in a long time for a number of reasons and when this line up got back together we just decided to play some shows and build on our strength to really just get together we did have some complaints from the fans that we shouldnt tour so much we should just put a record out but you know what that touring really helped prepare us and i think the record came out naturally and better because of it i dont think it would have been as good if we had rushed it
4773649 oh yeah i did it was a very different experience doing it now than doing it before
4773650 well it was a slightly different approach ive been out of it for a long time and ive been doing very different music so for me it felt right to just kinda ease back into it and the previous testament record the gathering i thought is the one where they really sorta found their formula outside of the original line up and i wanted that process to continue cause thats a great album so i didnt just wanna come in and expect it to be like it was 20 years ago when everybody was writing
4773651 absolutely and i think i was able to bring some of that influence not just by writing music but also by listening to what they were coming up with and really making suggestions and i did write some stuff thats on there
4773652 not a whole lot i did more of like arranging and listening and suggesting there is a whole song f e a r which i wrote music and lyrics and its kinda funny i got this reputation of being like the melodic guy in the band by writing more mellow stuff a lot of people think thats one of the heaviest songs
4773653 not really only with some of the guitar stuff but as far as the arrangements and the concept of it we tried different things eric and i have tried some different ideas and it seems to come together naturally that was supposed to be an instrumental we were practically done with the whole song and chuck came in with some lyrics for it and just to try it it just took on a whole new life and now its one of the most popular songs on the record
4773654 so i said let me go in and try something the next monday i came up with the lyrics and recorded it and it fell just right
4773655 it just became a completely different type of song and its a good closer song
4773656 i think so i think its a possibility we have a friend that is coming to some of the east coast shows that is going to film we havent filmed so far on this tour but if we capture the stuff that our friend is gonna shoot i think its gonna be cool
4773657 oh yeah absolutely but that is funny everything we do is all over youtube so the fans need a good quality dvd that captures the energy of the shows you know the first thing we did when we got back together it was to film a dvd but i think right now we are light years beyond that so a dvd of whats going on now will just destroy the last one
4773658 i think more so now because in the early 90s there was the whole alternative music revolution
4773659 yeah but not for long theres also the fact that the record couldnt have come out back then cause we didnt sound like this this record is the result of the experience that we had in those days this line up been going separate ways then coming back together and finding a new place to work from and also the fact that the environment out there is exciting because theres a lot of young fans that are re discovering our classic music and they are supporting the new music so we have this fan base that looks like the one we had 20 years ago and its the same age crowd mixed with some of the older fans out there too so i really think that the new record is the result of that so touring now is much more inspiring
4773660 we didnt expect it to go this far we got back together for a few reunion shows that went really well the line up kept changing as well on drums but i feel this is the line up that feels the strongest this is the line up that created this new records end resurgence so we dont see slowing down anytime soon
4773661 yeah its possible we actually re recorded the souls of black album but its not out yet we did it during the formation of damnation recording it may show up on a video game nothing i can talk right now cause its not official but we have the tracks so its possible it could come out on cd as well
4773662 well if im going to play metal its gotta be real theres a few reasons behind it i didnt play metal in years and in fact im proud that the metal i played was real metal i kinda took a risk by playing metal cause most other guitar players would go play more commercial stuff and at one point i was really comfortable with my jazz playing like i never expected to be in downbeat magazine which is like the rolling stone of jazz and i was in jazz is magazine played a few jazz festivals so once my jazz thing was going i felt that theres room if i wanted to be in a metal project so i think i was in a place where i wanted to re explore metal and right around that time lamb of god called me to play solo on the title track of ashes of the wake chris poland is also on that i went to see them at ozzfest then i met the guys from slipknot and they were very complimentary about my playing even zakk wylde has heard my jazz stuff but it was also clear that it would be cool to do some metal stuff and a very short time later i got a call from chuck it was perfect it was like fate so here we are
4773663 absolutely they are three very intense different and hard working projects it could be a little overwhelming sometimes but its very fulfilling its great
4773664 well its a very different environment its the type of thing where you sit and listen and you dont talk loud theres no moshpit its just about listening to the music it requires paying attention to the music but a lot of people have showed up not thinking they will like it and really like it because when you pay attention and you just listen it can be as exciting as another metal show in a very different way
4773665 thats true i think when you first listen to jazz its not in your face like metal it takes a little effort its like art in a way theres certain type of art you have to learn about to really appreciate it and with jazz thats often been the case because a lot of the songs are these old standard jazz repertoire and you have to study them to really appreciate whats going on in a jazz concert but with us the standards that we do youll recognize because theres song by the scorpions judas priest ozzy and even kiss so you recognize the form so you dont have to be a seasoned jazz listener to get it but the process totally comes from jazz so the pure jazz fans like it cause they can relate to it so are the rock fans some rock metal fans have been checking more into jazz because of us and its a huge compliment but we play originals too the originals have their own excitement
4773666 this tour takes us to the rest of the month then i have the trio tour the first half of september then testament goes to japan then australia we have 10 city dates in october in the states then ill do trans siberian orchestra in november december and in early spring testament is gonna start up again so there will be a lot of testament activities in 2009
4773667 well we will definitely write some material while we are not touring and possibly get back to the studio in early 2010
4773668 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4773669 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4773670 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4773671 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4773672 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4773673 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4773674 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4773675 what are the pros cons of a drum riser in this room and what exactly is the main purpose of one

4773677 i think this is a big deal both in terms of having something to offer patients with huntingtons disease and because people have been trying to find something for huntingtons patients for decades
4773678 its just wonderful to have a drug approved by the fda
4773679 its also important symbolically for the patients and their families theyve suffered for so long the big victory here is putting the drug on the map

4773700 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4773701 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4773702 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4773703 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4773704 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4773705 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4773706 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4773707 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4773708 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4773709 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4773710 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4773711 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4773712 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4773713 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4773714 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4773715 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4773716 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4773717 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4773718 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4773719 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4773720 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4773721 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4773722 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4773723 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4773724 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4773725 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4773726 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4773727 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4773728 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4773729 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4773730 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4773731 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4773732 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4773733 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4773734 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4773735 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4773736 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4773737 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4773738 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4773739 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4773740 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4773741 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4773742 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4773743 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4773744 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4773745 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4773746 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4773747 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4773748 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4773749 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4773750 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4773751 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4773752 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4773753 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4773754 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4773755 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4773756 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4773757 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4773758 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4773759 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4773760 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4773761 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4773762 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4773763 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4773764 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4773765 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4773766 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4773767 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4773768 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4773769 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4773770 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4773771 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4773772 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4773773 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4773774 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4773775 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4773776 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4773777 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4773778 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4773779 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4773780 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4773781 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4773782 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4773783 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4773784 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4773785 who are open to doing something on the production side
4773786 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4773787 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4773788 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4773791 for any citizen with time to spare and a alan au is 57
4773792 it has to do with us playing together for a while and understanding the system that we want to play with its a system that colangelo put into place that you see really coming to fruition
4773793 they knew what they needed to do to take us out of our game
4773794 i would tell you that last night that premise was buried once and for all
4773795 the guys played it the way coach mike krzyzewski wanted to play it and look what happened
4773796 we chose the team to fit the type of defense that we felt needed to be played in the international game
4773797 were good with that decision we have to go out and continue to prove it weve been playing very good defense thats been the one constant that and effort
4773798 if somebody gets beat theres a guy there to help out thats a big thing and i think the three year program is a big reason for that
4773799 spain is a little bit more like an nba team
4773800 they have depth they have a top quality point guard calderon is respected by everybody on this team youre not going to shake them up youre going to have to play them every exchange
4773801 teams dont even make offers until hours before the deadline and in many cases minutes before the deadline
4773802 this deadline creates a major administrative problems and it completely for most draft picks removes almost in its entirety the negotiation process
4773803 obviously being 21 years old this is the first of this type of experience for me it was different im extremely excited to be a giant and i cant wait to get started
4773804 we were extremely competitive trying to sign him we offered a major league contract
4773805 we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were very disappointed
4773806 bob nutting has made a commitment to provide the club with the tools and resources necessary to return the pirates to the greatness that this organization has achieved so often in its rich history
4773807 he has further demonstrated that commitment by his active involvement throughout this process and by providing us with the significant dollars necessary to sign pedro alvarez
4773808 our producers pride themselves on fairness we have to trust producers and we have to have the public trust us

4773826 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4773827 im hoping the new partnership at liverpool works with robbie keane just behind fernando torres or keane alongside torres
4773828 the thing is ive heard rafa benitez saying keane can play anywhere left side or right side if he plays robbie on the left or right then hes not going to get the best out of him
4773829 to get the best out of robbie is to play him down the centre with torres if benitez does he will get the best out of the partnership
4773830 if hes going to switch him with dirk kuyt and play him on the left and the right i dont think its going to work
4773831 robbie and torres are both intelligent players torres makes great runs and robbie has played with dimitar berbatov and a lot of players so he knows where to go and where not to go
4773832 i think he will bring more out of torres and vice versa so long as they play up front together
4773833 death to america even bringing out missiles that say that

4774049 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4774051 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4774052 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4774053 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4774054 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4774055 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4774056 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4774057 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4774058 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4774061 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4774062 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4774063 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4774064 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

4774073 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4774074 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4774075 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4774076 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4774125 as a preliminary matter we find that the riehms have not presented sufficient evidence regarding any first or fourth amendment violations by cook county or by dierckss supervisor ann debevec the county cannot be held vicariously liable for its agents actions under 1983 while david lacked the history of violent tendencies we found relevant to the true threat analysis in pulaski the other factors considered in our analysis establish that davids third essay qualifies as a true threat while the author of the threat in pulaski did not give his letter to the subject of the threat david provided his essays directly to mershon and he submitted them on the schools campus his third essay went significantly farther and expressed in graphic terms a plan to kill her and himself we conclude that as in pulaski davids third essay constitutes a true threat and is not protected under the first amendment

4774223 once you around the bend youll never be the same
4774224 while i wish so and so wouldnt have happened at the same time i kindah dont because its made me who i am today
4774225 why not us is this the bridge in five ten or fifteen years
4774226 i shouldnt have to lock my doors this is fill in the town name
4774227 caro direttore ho letto con grande attenzione gli articoli di cinzia sasso e natalia aspesi pubblicati sul suo quotidiano il 26 maggio che hanno trattato in modo mirabile la delicatissima questione della violenza sulle donne da ministro della repubblica ritengo prioritario soffermarsi sul background che sta alla base di un fenomeno doloroso per una societ che si definisce civile ritengo necessario un grande impegno culturale per ridare serenit alle donne italiane spesso costrette a vivere in contesti oggettivamente difficili nel vostro speciale c un quadro che condivido solo in parte il contesto familiare viene dipinto come un luogo buio e pericoloso per le donne mi sia consentito di dissentire la famiglia da sempre la cellula primaria della societ italiana essa rappresenta il fondamento del tessuto sociale spesso funge da vero e proprio strumento di coesione e ammortizzazione sociale e come tale necessita di tutela la famiglia va ricordato anche un luogo di realizzazione per la donna al pari del mondo del lavoro nessuno nega e non sar certamente io la prima il fatto che non di rado la stessa famiglia a trasformarsi in luogo di commissione di reati ai danni delle donne trasformazione dettata da una cultura errata e distorta a volte maschilista e violenta ma una trasformazione non la regola le analisi statistiche da voi riportate e da noi conosciute e studiate sottolineano anche un altro aspetto divorzi separazioni ed affidamento dei figli causano gran parte delle tensioni e dei reati realizzati all interno della famiglia ecco che diviene necessario un intervento al fine di applicare maggiormente le procedure di affidamento condiviso dei minori anche per concretizzare il principio di bigenitorialit garantito dalle convenzioni internazionali il minore ha il sacrosanto diritto di avere un padre e una madre un diritto per il minore che attraverso l affidamento condiviso pu divenire un occasione in meno di scontro se non di violenza tra gli ex partner dal momento in cui il 68 3 delle violenze contro le donne si consumano in casa quindi in un luogo privato ed il 93 delle donne non denuncia la violenza subita dal partner emerge drammaticamente il rifiuto da parte delle stesse che preferiscono la strada del silenzio per evitare la reiterazione del comportamento violento ma anche per mancanza di fiducia nella giustizia senza dimenticare che la mancata denuncia anche un tentativo di circoscrivere la tragedia personale della donna nella ristretta sfera familiare altro dato allarmante emerso dallo speciale del suo quotidiano che solo il 2 8 delle donne si rivolge ai centri anti violenza alla luce di questi dati mi sembra doveroso intervenire al fine di rivedere ripensare e rafforzare tali centri di certo il problema della violenza sulle donne non si risolve solo da un punto di vista culturale il mio obiettivo come ministro per le pari opportunit sar quello di accelerare i tempi per l approvazione del progetto di legge contro lo stalking ripartendo dal testo gi approvato in commissione giustizia che sicuramente otterr il sostegno dell opposizione non credo esista strumento migliore della concretezza per dare risposte a un problema che da anni affligge le donne e la societ italiana su questa linea che intendo indirizzare la mia attivit

4774259 this funding will help connect people in scott county to a clean reliable source of water as we expand and improve the infrastructure in the water supply district
4774260 anything thats going to benefit the project is a good thing
4774261 blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb
4774262 h ighly schematic accounts of stages in the interior life should probably not be taken too literally especially in a time and place when god in his wisdom often seems to operate by a different set of rules
4774263 had to work hard and even argue quite bluntly against certain spiritual directors who did not understand this reality at all to convince people given this grace that they should welcome it
4774264 not try to return to their former habit of meditation t hey should be content to stay before god in an attitude of self forgetfulness and simple loving peaceful attentiveness
4774265 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine
4774266 but then the second doctor told me i had it i was in denial i dont understand exactly what it is the symptoms seem to apply to everyone around me in the industry loss of memory starting something and not finishing it
4774267 now dear friends i invite you to foster together with me a devoted and filial memory of the servant of god pope paul vi since three days from now we will recall the 30th anniversary of his death it was in fact the evening of august 6 1978 when he rendered his spirit to god that evening was the feast of the transfiguration of jesus the mystery of divine light that always exercised a singular fascination upon his soul such a supreme pastor of the church paul vi guided the people of god toward the contemplation of the face of christ redeemer of humanity and lord of history it was precisely the loving orientation of the mind and heart towards christ which was one of the cardinal points of the second vatican council a fundamental attitude which my venerated predecessor john paul ii inherited and re launched in the great jubilee of 2000 christ is always at the center of everything at the center of sacred scripture and tradition at the heart of the church of the world and of the entire universe
4774268 divine providence called giovanni battista montini from the chair of milan to that of rome in the most delicate moment of the council when the intuition of blessed john xxiii was at risk of not taking form how can we not give thanks to the lord for his fertile and courageous pastoral activity bit by bit as our view of the past expands and our understanding deepens the merit of paul vi in presiding over the council leading it happily to its conclusion and then governing the turbulent post conciliar phase appears ever greater indeed i would say almost super human we can truly say with the apostle paul that in him the grace of god was not in vain 1 cor 15 10 it made the most of his obvious gifts of intelligence and his passionate love for the church and for humanity as we give thanks to god for the gift of this great pope let us commit ourselves to treasuring his teachings
4774269 if our prayer consists of nothing more than that holding ourselves before god without doing anything or thinking of anything special without any particular feelings but with a heartfelt attitude of availability and trusting abandonment then we could not do any better
4774270 as st john of the cross explained so well this halting of ones activity so god can act freely is what explains certain times of aridity when it is impossible to make the mind or imagination work or feel anything or meditate god puts us into that state a kind of night so that he alone acts deeply within us just as a surgeon anaesthetizes a patient so as to be able to work freely
4774271 here we touch on something absolutely fundamental there is no true love for god which is not built on recognition of the absolute priority of gods love for us there is no true love for god that has not grasped that before doing anything at all we have first to receive
4774272 i believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church in spite of everything
4774273 the freedom i shared with my brethren in spontaneous prayer the radical openness to god that asked
4774274 if i couldnt do the little job i couldnt get to the big job
4774275 i get my inspiration from people i love to have conversations with people find out about their lives steal it and put it in a song
4774276 it was really exciting they are definitely two of the greatest rappers to have ever lived being able to write with such great writers and being in the same room with them was amazing
4774277 mr roberts ross is an excellent person and an outstanding member in his community ive known him for quite some time and its a pleasure to represent him

4774280 mengapa anda membagi bagikan bibit jagung terbaik itu pada tetangga tetangga anda bukankah mereka mengikuti kontes ini juga setiap tahunnya
4774281 bahwa angin menerbangkan serbuk sari dari bunga bunga yang masak dan menebarkannya dari satu ladang ke ladang yang lain bila tanaman jagung tetangga saya buruk maka serbuk sari yang ditebarkan ke ladang saya juga buruk ini tentu menurunkan kualitas jagung saya bila saya ingin mendapatkan hasil jagung yang baik saya harus menolong tetangga saya mendapatkan jagung yang baik pula
4774282 let me say it once more should the court overrule zach and richard scruggs fifth amendment objections to the questions posed to them at their depositions the plaintiffs request an order clarifying on which topics the defendants may question the deponents in view of the defendants demonstrated inability to contain their questions to the narrow range of topics permitted by the court plaintiffs further request that the defendants not be allowed to conduct live depositions again but be required to submit written questions and that those questions be reviewed in advance by the court folks thats paragraph one page one of a whopping total of 295 pages and she takes names too read the motion and notice she has included the transcript from the depositions of the scruggses and added a table of contents that points out the 22 examples of state farm violating judge walkers order allowing a very narrow point of disc0very fit the fourth the hunting as if its not long past time for the first qui tam discovery filed jointly by maison heidelberg and the attorneys from gilbert randolph as i think ive already remarked
4774283 you may charge me with murder or want of sense
4774284 the rigsbys cannot show that they produced evidence of a meritorious fraud claim
4774285 clearly the record couldnt be more plain that sen lott and his associates were talking to people that were key advisers to mr scruggs paid consultants and those who were creating an illusion that simply doesnt have any basic fact
4774286 i expect to follow up deposition of both zach and dick which will now have to take place in a federal penitentiary
4774287 to clarify the mcintosh order by confirming that it does not preclude the relators from testifying in this case state farm submits that it is premature to preemptively determine what testimony the rigsbys might properly or improperly attempt to offer in this action
4774288 in due course any justiciable controversy that may arise as this case
4774289 he is shouting like mad only hark he is waving his hands he is wagging his head he has certainly found a snark

4774298 ini bukanlah masalah berat absolutnya tapi tergantung berapa lama anda memegangnya

4774307 saya punya pertanyaan jika kau dapat menemukan jawabannya di dalam hati saya saya akan merubah pikiran saya seandainya saya menyukai setangkai bunga indah yang ada di tebing gunung dan kita berdua tahu jika kamu memanjat gunung itu kamu akan mati apakah kamu akan melakukannya untuk saya

4774312 kamu selalu pegal 2 pada waktu teman baikmu datang setiap bulannya dan saya harus memberikan tangan saya untuk memijat kakimu yang pegal
4774313 kamu senang diam di rumah dan saya selalu kuatir kamu akan menjadi aneh dan harus membelikan sesuatu yang dapat menghiburmu di rumah atau meminjamkan lidahku untuk menceritakan hal hal lucu yang aku alami
4774314 kamu selalu menatap komputermu membaca buku dan itu tidak baik untuk kesehatan matamu saya harus menjaga mata saya agar ketika kita tua nanti saya masih dapat menolong mengguntingkan kukumu dan mencabuti ubanmu
4774315 tanganku akan memegang tanganmu membimbingmu menelusuri pantai menikmati matahari pagi dan pasir yang indah menceritakan warna2 bunga yang bersinar dan indah seperti cantiknya wajahmu
4774316 tetapi sayangku saya tidak akan mengambil bunga itu untuk mati karena saya tidak sanggup melihat air matamu mengalir menangisi kematianku
4774317 sayangku saya tahu ada banyak orang yang bisa mencintaimu lebih dari saya mencintaimu
4774318 untuk itu sayang jika semua yang telah diberikan tanganku kakiku mataku tidak cukup bagimu aku tidak bisa menahan dirimu mencari tangan kaki dan mata lain yang dapat membahagiakanmu

4774328 but it seemed like it was taking the community calendar which has always been around and it making it more universal
4774329 so really let it go beyond what the original community calendar was
4774330 to start as a listing of events but also really become a community resource for conversation and getting to know each other in different ways
4774331 fundamental right of self determination subject only to the states compelling and overriding interest
4774332 we can conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning ones body that one can make in the course of a lifetime than the decision of the terminally ill in their choice of whether to discontinue necessary medical treatment

4774339 broken dreams lie next to me their hope left on the floor ill help you up my friend and build your courage more
4774340 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4774341 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4774342 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4774343 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4774344 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4774345 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4774346 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4774347 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4774348 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4774349 whatever you are meant to do do it now the conditions are always impossible
4774350 it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things
4774351 im really hoping that ill serve as a role model to my children
4774352 we will have something right here that we can call our own
4774353 im very excited about how we can work together as a board to help improve every public school students public school experience in south carolina
4774354 if we asked the state tomorrow to let us be a trauma center they would say only when you do this list of 10 or 12 things and my guess is they would never allow it

4774364 we dont have bag drop off here you have to wait in line like everyone else
4774365 redefine the small business online banking and cash management space
4774366 although small business banking and corporate cash management applications provide a slew of features and functionality they look and feel out of date arent easy enough to use and cant stand up to what the customer would really like
4774367 some banks will unfortunately keep things status quo while others have already begun to recognize the need for significant change and innovation with the ultimate goal of enhancing the user experience and the customer relationship
4774368 old model of burning movies to dvd only wasnt profitable and was a solution for yesterdays problem rather than addressing the changing way people consume movies and music
4774369 with ncrs advanced technology these machines will dispense a wide array of dvds and could offer digital downloading in the future all under the blockbuster brand
4774370 this initial rollout provides consumers increasingly convenient access to their favorite movies and is one more step in the fulfillment of our mission to transform blockbuster into a multi channel provider of media entertainment
4774371 this alliance with blockbuster is an exciting step for ncr as we pursue our mission of becoming the leader in the market for entertainment self service solutions
4774372 looking beyond this initial deployment our mutual goal is to have 10 000 kiosks installed within 18 months we are energized and thrilled to be such an integral part of blockbusters strategy for providing consumers with greater choice and convenience
4774373 when people think of airports they think of highly secure security focused environments
4774374 so the notion that in that very environment you could have a significant security breach many would find troubling
4774375 the potential use or misuse of this data could be widespread
4774376 passports are a better way to go than credit cards
4774377 im a little bit hesitant to put my credit card into anything
4774378 i think its a little bit weird a little bit unusual to check in with your credit card
4774379 in our busy kiosks were visiting five six seven eight times a day to ensure the kiosk hasnt been tampered with
4774380 i guess it could happen anywhere when you use a credit card
4774381 its a shame you think with an airline youd be more safe since most people book their flights on credit cards
4774382 we dont see the information we just pass it back and forth
4774383 and thats been audited and thats working the way its supposed to and our network is secure and its been checked out very very recently
4774384 visa has done some investigating and were working with them
4774385 and thats not specific just to pearson thats just a standard thing apparently they have an investigations wing and they like to make sure things are working the way theyre supposed to
4774386 i dont know what prompted their questions but our kiosks have proven to be working exactly as theyre supposed to
4774387 were investigating isolated reports of fraud and were working with airport officials to investigate the situation
4774388 were aware of the situation and obviously monitoring it very closely
4774389 we request that you provide your full co operation to the visa investigators and if your systems are found to be insecure the gtaa requires that you implement immediate remediation measures
4774390 as the gtaa takes seriously the possibility of credit card fraud which may be occurring at toronto pearson we have also advised the 13 airlines on the arinc and sita platforms at toronto pearson of the visa investigation and have requested them to contact visa and to co operate in their investigation
4774391 we are very concerned about the potential repercussions of this situation should the travelling public lose faith in the security of the credit card system at canadian airports or should the credit card companies and or card issuers take steps to advise people to stop using credit cards for check in at canadian airports i am therefore writing to you to encourage your full co operation with visa canada and other credit card companies and to take the necessary steps to resolve this matter as quickly as possible
4774392 accordingly it is only the airlines arinc and or sita who can provide the necessary information to visa canada to conduct its investigation and only these companies that can provide the appropriate remedy should any of their systems be found to be insecure
4774393 were kind of the glue that holds it all together
4774394 we dont have any content in the kiosks all we can do is kind of help anybody that needs it the software is not ours
4774395 we take matters such as this seriously in all aspects of our business and we will support this assessment as necessary to the fullest extent we can
4774396 did you ever notice that when youre fat men dont look you in the eye they look across your shoulder theres no eye contact my name is leslie mcclennahan im a real person i live near goose creek south carolina up until two years ago i was never looked in the eye by anyone

4774421 the knife incident while being bad itself isnt what frustrated me the most
4774422 what is equally bad is the way mcdonalds corp has been unresponsive to the incident
4774423 we are obviously dealing with mcdonalds employees someone that i assume was in a managerial position carrying weapons into the restaurant if something like a customer expecting a refund for food that they didnt ask for or eat caused this employee to pull a knife on me and my friend who is to say they wouldnt use a knife to threaten a mother with an impatient crying baby or an elderly person complaining that their cheeseburger has pickles to me its obviously a public safety issue that needs to be investigated from the top
4774424 how could this have happened who hired this person and what customer service training did they receive how did they become a manager does mcdonalds perform background checks on managers something is definitely wrong when a person a manager nonetheless pulls out a weapon so easily so quickly with every indication that he is a threat to your life
4774425 i made regional management aware of the problem and was told someone would call me back and of course i never received the call i called back and got the brush off you know saying that my message was passed on and to be patient i waited a bit and i was concerned about public safety so i then emailed corporate again to no response the whole situation especially feeling as if one customer is unimportant to a big corporation has been very unsettling

4774438 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4774439 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4774440 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4774441 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4774442 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4774443 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4774444 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4774445 now one of the sunshine states big boy programs south florida is entering its eighth year of division i a football with adult sized standards
4774446 to win 10 11 games to get in that category not many teams do that now
4774447 true enough but their pillowy soft preconference schedule was what made the jayhawks school record 12 1 mark suspect in the eyes of many it wasnt the teams they played in the league that happened to be through no fault of the jayhawks going through down years but none of that is a problem now once again in fact mangino may wind up using the schedule to psyche up his troops the road is about to get much much tougher despite the loss of several key players the jayhawks could be better than last year and not have nearly as fine a record
4774448 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4774449 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4774450 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4774451 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4774452 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4774453 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4774454 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4774455 im flattered that the big east coaches see usf volleyball as a top five program within the conference
4774456 i think the pre season ranking is a direct reflection of our 2007 success and the fact we return 12 players and five starters we realize that a pre season ranking is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things its the post season ranking that really counts its a nice place to start but we will work hard every day to hopefully finish even better
4774457 it is obvious that she is respected for her abilities by all the coaches in the big east and that is an honor in itself
4774458 i am obviously biased but marcela is well deserving of the recognition she has worked extremely hard in the off season and is very committed to her own development as well as her teams development marcela is anxious to take the court and do what she does best play
4774459 all members of dpps work hard for our community and make a significant contribution to policing and the safety of our community
4774460 the fact that officers who attended the scene were also attacked is appalling and i am relieved that no one was injured
4774461 i know right lets try to come up with something else stupid to say
4774462 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4774463 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4774464 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4774465 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4774466 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4774467 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4774468 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4774469 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4774470 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4774471 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4774472 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4774473 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4774474 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4774475 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4774476 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4774477 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4774478 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4774479 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4774480 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4774481 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4774482 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4774488 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4774489 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4774490 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4774491 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4774492 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4774493 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4774494 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4774495 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4774496 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4774497 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4774498 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4774499 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4774500 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4774501 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4774502 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4774503 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4774504 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4774505 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4774506 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4774507 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4774508 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4774509 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4774510 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4774511 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4774512 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4774513 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4774514 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4774515 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4774516 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4774517 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4774518 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4774519 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4774520 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4774521 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4774522 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4774523 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4774524 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4774525 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4774526 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4774527 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4774528 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4774529 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4774530 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4774571 my name has been linked with the italian national team and i think this nation does not ignore its young players when there is quality in the end though its down to the coach to decide he said he would consider all players between 18 and 40 so i fit in that bracket
4774572 i had to wait such a long time for 13 august 2008 to become an italian citizen im taking it one step at a time and of course it also depends on how i perform this season
4774573 the reality of doing science day to day involves talking and arguing and thinking and its in those arguments that the scientific method lurks if you cant defend your idea with data whether talking to a journals referee to your colleagues in the office down the corridor or even to yourself then it doesnt survive
4774574 the big 50 was a popular buffalo hunters rifle used in the old west according to historian jay w sharp who writes about billy dixon and other buffalo hunters surrounded by a band of hostile cheyenne warriors in 1874 after a day of fighting with casualties on both sides
4774575 billy dixon famous among the buffalo hunters for his skill with a rifle leveled a borrowed
4774576 the buffalo hunters were too much for us they stood behind adobe walls they had telescopes on their guns one of our men was knocked off his horse by a spent bullet fired at a range of about a mile it stunned but did not kill him

4774609 this product has caused tremendous worry among content creators who want to understand how its use may possibly affect their business
4774610 in particular they are concerned about theft of their creations and the potential for unscrupulous people to undercut their prices and essentially take away their business
4774611 copybot is not a product that we sell or distribute its a debugging tool and silly demo with a now obviously bad choice of name hopefully you wont be seeing copy bot on slex any time soon
4774612 youll never get around the potential for abuse and the negativity associated with this particular app
4774613 but i think the idea of clones and bots is very cool and ill be adding more new features for things like automated go go dancers at clubs
4774614 even if i pull this program plenty of other people out there have it or have the knowledge to create something bigger and better
4774615 my advice is to offer the whole package when you sell something dont just offer a couch but a couch that has several custom poses work one on one with people to create unique things and offer customization services instead of throwing up some prims for sale and forgetting about it
4774616 have the option of using the dmca process to file a complaint its a difficult process but it is one that were willing to pursue on your behalf because we agree that copying is a disincentive to creation
4774617 if the server is put in control of users they can reverse engineer everything
4774618 if they had access to that source they could take the multi gadget scripts in 10 seconds its a big worry
4774619 i can steal as long as im creative and write new code
4774620 i can steal and sell other peoples creations because i can and it is technologically feasible
4774621 if you can see it you can copy it therefore it is never worth trying to stop theft of intellectual property by technological social or legal means
4774622 we will begrudingly add a tos provision making the use of copybot an offense but thats only a temporary measure we view as an expedience to deal with our high paying customers were forced to endure now but hopefully we will enlighten them in time and be able to drop this tos restriction or get by without their revenue completely
4774623 lets come up with all kinds of other business models besides actually selling music and protecting the copyright on digital intellectual property
4774624 for this system to work as an economy though there has to be a way to actually get something out of your good reputation say in sl that land was given out based on reputation and people with a certain rating got an island it would make for a radically different environment if theres money coming in somewhere its easier if there is ad revenue the higher your reputation the higher the percentage of ad revenue passed on to you

4774629 we are pleased and appreciative of the spirit of cooperation between the two tribes delawares and cherokees which has enabled us to arrive at a point that legislation to restore our federal recognition has been reached chief smith and congressman john sullivan have been instrumental in assisting with the mechanics of getting our legislation drafted and introduced before congress i certainly dont want to minimize the cooperation and assistance from the members of the cherokee nation tribal council we are looking forward to working with members of congress and particularly the oklahoma delegation in getting this bill moved through both houses
4774630 there is an old adage which states if you call yourself a leader and you look back and no one is following you you are just out taking a walk
4774631 the so called delaware leaders and town hall meeting is not an official meeting of the delaware tribe of indians and the majority of elected officials of the tribe will not be in attendance

4774654 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4774655 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time

4774676 a happy face does not come by chance it comes by happy thoughts
4774677 affirmations are among the most powerful tools we can use for personal transformation they are highly reliable easy to use and are based on impeccable logic
4774678 my normal weight is 130 pounds and thats what i weigh
4774679 my normal weight is 160 pounds and thats what i weigh
4774680 my normal weight is 130 pounds and thats what i weigh
4774681 but if you lose the weight others will expect you to keep it off
4774682 but if you lose the weight you will have to spend a lot of money for new clothes
4774683 but if you lose the weight men will hit on you and expect sex
4774684 but if you lose the weight men wont hit on you and then you will know you arent loveable
4774685 but if you lose the weight you will have to give up your favorite foods
4774686 are highly reliable perhaps more reliable than any other tool and do indeed manifest in peoples lives that which is affirmed
4774687 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small doesnt serve the world theres nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our fear our presence automatically liberates others
4774688 what are you afraid might happen if you do lose weight stop smoking etc
4774689 i am very impressed with your series i am a master practitioner of nlp as well as hypnosis and tft i have been listening to criticism from other hypnotherapists about affirmations for a long time i teach my clients to create a power image and a power phrase that is to be repeated over and over again until they believe it it works they lose weight once they replace that image with a healthy one and the self talk changes
4774690 i liked your idea of combining affirmations with eft im thinking that you wouldnt even have to bring the negative reply to the positive affirmation into your conscious mind how about treating any resistance reversal with the setup etc then keep repeating the affirmation as you tap the eft points wiping away the negative possibly subconscious responses as they come up without having to actually verbalize them it maybe just taking off the tops of the trees in the forest but if done daily wouldnt the forest eventually disappear
4774691 am really enjoying the palace of possibilities i have had an experience with
4774692 but you know hes not going to die until hes 73
4774693 reading your latest chapter i have to agree that you are correct consistent thoughts create our reality affirmations are a powerful tool and should they not work it is because they are in direct conflict with the body energy system subconscious overwrite what is programmed into the subconscious or the body energy system and your consistent affirmations will reprogram your subconscious what you described is basically no it is exactly what hypnosis is and does i can get a client and give suggestions affirmations and their behavior will change accordingly if it doesnt i have to delete old beliefs memories events etc first and then program new affirmations suggestions there is more than one way to skin a cat and i know that you can do the exact same thing with affirmations and deleting the old beliefs with eft
4774694 well done now i think you are finally discussing what has been behind the evolution of your eft technique in giving some thought to what you stated i think that sometimes we spend so much time in a formal education that we feel that we must stick to the rules of that education to give it credence we hate to think that we went through all of that trouble for nothing and for that reason may be reluctant to accept new ideas
4774695 beliefs are those writing on the wall you speak of and are often formed from early experiences in life core beliefs the cog txt might say treating the negative life belief is a target for energy therapy as you say frequently there are many aspects to those beliefs and prs that need correction again you are correct if the negative life belief is not treated as a problem emotion whose intensity needs to be eliminated the intention will be more difficulty to install the part that i would add to your formulation is that the therapist can assist by focusing his her intention to amplify the clients positive intention that is part of being a healer vs a counselor technician therapist
4774696 actually i have some of my clients use affirmations often i have some problems with setting it up for them part of that may rest on my own feelings i believe as you do that they are very powerful almost too powerful i found my current employment with affirmations sometimes i get a bit afraid because of their power i know that doesnt make a bit of sense i think that i have a fundamentalist deep inside as a part of my shadow so while i am very liberal in most of my views when things like affirmations succeed there is a small part that is unnerved anyway i had not thought about combining them with emdr my tool i think you have hit on a very effective tool for helping others

4774781 i just wanted to tell you how much i appreciated your candy bar idea last month my husbands family had a reunion to honor his mother who passed away last year i created candy bars for the reunion using your idea since momma was an avid crocheter i found a background of a crocheted doily and added 2 different photos that fit the theme i designed it so that i could fit 2 on each 8 1 2 x 11 sheet and printed a master copy i then took my master to office max and had them make 50 copies after wrapping a mixture of hershey milk chocolate bars and hershey milk chocolate with almond bars i filled a basket with the 100 candy bars tied a bow on the basket handle and they were given out as mementos i am attaching a picture of the filled basket thank you again i received many complements

4774788 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4774789 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4774790 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4774791 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4774792 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think arsenal who do not appear to have replaced mathieu flamini or alexander hleb although any side boasting arsene wenger as manager has to be respected arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4774793 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4774794 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4774795 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4774796 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4774797 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4774798 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4774799 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again
4774800 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4774801 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4774802 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4774803 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4774804 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4774805 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4774806 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4774815 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4774816 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4774817 in 1985 there were 14 500 banks in the u s and now theres 7 200
4774818 for the past 23 years six of them went away each week the big universal banks might get hit but they stay in business and come out with a bigger share of the market than they had before
4774819 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas

4774822 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4774823 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4774824 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4774825 it went extremely well and we are delighted that the norwegian guard honoured nils olav with a knighthood
4774826 we all enjoyed the occasion and nils was a perfect penguin throughout

4774847 animals whose sole function is to provide emotional support comfort therapy companionship therapeutic benefits or to promote emotional well being are not service animals

4774856 this is consistent with religious diversity in the united states
4774857 more people are interacting with people of other faiths four in 10 are married to someone from a different faith background these are all pieces to the puzzle
4774858 what this shows is the ability of americans to hold contradictory beliefs and not be bothered by it

4774889 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
4774890 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
4774891 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
4774892 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
4774893 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
4774894 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
4774895 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
4774896 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it

4774905 flaminius had reached the lake at the sunset of one day and when it was barely light on that which followed he went through the defile without reconnoitering
4774906 what do you do to make sure that youre reaching every student
4774907 id certainly be willing to work on it and take input and constructive criticism but i dont want to give you a false impression of my skills as they stand now
4774908 flaminius had reached the lake at the sunset of one day and when it was barely light on that which followed he went through the defile without reconnoitering
4774909 a great person who works tirelessly and doesnt ask anything of her teachers that she herself is not willing to do
4774910 we wanted to help out with education as its something everyone takes for granted you go to school in this country until you are 16 at least in other parts of the world thats not the case
4774911 it was nice to feel when i got to the top that i had really earned it and done something to help those girls in africa
4774912 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4774913 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4774914 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4774915 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4774916 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4774917 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4774918 well wishers are trying to ensure that matters are settled amicably through discussions rather than going through a long protracted impeachment process

4774924 it was obviously very disappointing not to win but we have plenty of positives to take from the game we found the first half quite hard with the new laws we had a lot of space in the first half and we were a bit timid about using the space but as the game went on we got better we showed throughout the game that we have a strong defence the two tries bath scored were disappointing but errors do happen late on in a half and we can build on that the game was definitely a starting block for the season ahead and it was great to see the young players and the new members of the team getting some time on the pitch although it would have been nice to get some more points on the board and win we have started the season on a positive note a lot of the young guys did well against a strong bath side everyone who played has reason to be happy with their performance it was a good start to our season but we know the standards we want to get to so we still have a lot of work to do to matt williams was pleased with the team and knows that we are improved from last year it was great to see such a good crowd at the game there is a real buzz around training and the squad at the minute and we hope that buzz carries through to the supporters we want there to be an excitement around the province about ulster rugby with people wanting to come and watch ulster play at ravenhill the crowd really know how to lift the team on the pitch and we hope that this season we can show the supporters what we can do we know that when the magners league starts against the scarlets on the 5th september it will be about winning so we really want to get a couple of wins in at the next two pre season games and go into the league on the right footing
4774925 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4774926 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4774927 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4774928 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4774929 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4774930 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4774931 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast
4774932 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4774933 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4774934 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4774935 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4774936 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4774937 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really
4774938 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment
4774939 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4774940 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4774941 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4774942 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4774943 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use

4774952 siamo di fronte ad un vero e proprio accanimento personale nei confronti di chi si occupa di sicurezza de angelis infatti nel 2006 aveva subito un analogo provvedimento poi ritirato dalle fs sempre per la sua attivit sindacale durante la vertenza dei macchinisti contro il pedale delluomo morto

4774973 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4774974 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining

4774976 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous i thought she learned she grew and i think by the end she was running like a house on fire
4774977 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change we have to be able to show that there are economically viable options
4774978 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that
4774979 but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
4774980 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
4774981 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath

4775069 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the u s department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38 5 million doses of vaccine to protect against a new strain of avian influenza sanofi pasteur has a multi year contract with hhs as part of its pandemic program and will receive a payment of 192 5 million booked in the second quarter of 2008 for acceptance of the bulk vaccine lot in 2007 sanofi pasteur received 126 9 million for its bulk pandemic vaccine
4775070 sanofi aventis is to build a new influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in china
4775071 in recent years more and more western pharmaceutical corporations such as gsk roche novo nordisk and others have come to china and set up r amp d centers
4775072 as of 2004 three years after chinas wto entry nearly all global pharmaceutical companies have already completed their accession into the chinese market and will gradually shift their focus to research development the main reasons for overseas companies coming to china have been to save costs by using the extensive science and technology research bases currently in place in china the abundant human resources and less expensive medical and clinical trials
4775073 mutations of the traditional influenza virus cannot naturally become deadly virulent it takes laboratory assistance and the addition of toxic adjuvants in a prepared vaccine to accomplish this task in short the only way for a pandemic to occur is if it is pre planned and lab induced as a biological weapon
4775074 a reader has asked me to comment on the rather alarming document reproduced on august 8 2005 in epoch times
4775075 what about the several millions of our compatriots in the united states
4775076 there are 6 7 billion humans on planet earth this equates to a statistical infection rate of 000000004215 percent in other words statistically speaking you are over 100 000 times more likely to be hit by lightning in your home than to contract the bird flu
4775077 the world is teetering on the edge of a flu pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population
4775078 an outbreak of avian influenza would kill between 5 million and 150 million people on each continent
4775079 the current u s capacity for manufacturing egg based vaccines is not sufficient to supply our entire population hhs is supporting research into human kidney cell based vaccine manufacture of producing vaccine domestically
4775080 the fda can use its emergency use authorization authority to permit the use of unapproved products if theres a reasonable belief the products may be effective
4775081 they always tell you what their going to do before they do it
4775082 you wouldnt go out to the movies you wouldnt congregate with people
4775083 youd pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down
4775084 depending on how fast it is spreading it seems as though you really need to throw everything you can at it
4775085 we are not talking about simply shutting things down for a day or two like a snow day
4775086 in the context of a very infectious disease that is killing a large number of the people i think large fractions of the population wont have a problem with these recommendations
4775087 weve made significant progress not that we dont have a lot more to do

4775123 ik ben heel trots op de prestatie van mijn ploegmaats toen ik terug op de tribune kwam stond het tot mijn verbazing al 2 1 prachtige prestatie van de ploeg die op het ek ook al toonde dat ze kwalitatief en collectief heel sterk is natuurlijk blijf ik met een dubbel gevoel achter heel blij met de zege maar heel jammer dat ik de halve finale mis ik zal me een goeie supporter tonen dinsdag en hopen dat we de finale halen
4775124 ik ben kwaad en ik ben zeker niet van plan om af te koelen voor ik terugkeer naar het atletendorp ik had misschien meer wedstrijdritme nodig maar dat is geen excuus ik had misschien meer moeten trainen en lopen ik heb geprobeerd om mijn tempo vast te houden met mijn hamstrings ging het nochtans goed zulke dingen gebeuren

4775249 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4775250 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4775251 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4775252 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4775253 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4775254 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4775255 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4775256 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations

4775265 i know you think you know and perhaps you may know a little bit about japanese culture youve probably seen some anime and read some manga but this is different this is an event entrenched in history and protocol there are many things about comiket that even japanese people dont know so what im going to do is try to set you up with someone who can show you around make sure they can answer any questions you have and help you get the story you need ok

4775275 i learned early on to be in two different realities
4775276 we look at the people down below literally from up in the mountains they have to get up at a certain time in the morning they have to pay for everything with money which they have to earn doing things for other people

4775280 kerry brings more money and name recognition to the table than any other name on the obama list so far americans do tend to love a comeback kid and this would be the most amazing political comeback since richard nixon came back from the dead forty years ago obama suffers from being a new face on the political scene but kerry warts and all is well known to the voters and in 2004 he did draw more votes than any democrat ever has web site funded by kerrys political action committee kerry would eagerly assume the role of attack dog allowing a nominee who prefers to float above the fray to minimize the amount of political hardball he has to play

4775282 this is a recurring problem states have during every recession
4775283 there is good support for fiscal relief by several key members of congress such as rep john dingell d of michigan
4775284 but it all depends on whether congress does a second fiscal stimulus package and that is looking increasingly doubtful with president bush saying he would veto any more fiscal stimulus
4775285 you can define who to cover and how to set rates
4775286 many doctors were forced to stop seeing new medical patients or in some cases existing ones
4775287 the reimbursement rate for a regular 15 minute visit was 24 which is below the cost of providing care
4775288 that means an adult making 14 500 a year the equivalent of the minimum wage would not be getting healthcare
4775289 some of the rural hospitals are on the edge of bankruptcy
4775290 i had one rural hospital with 40 beds 39 of them for long term patients tell me they can go two more weeks before they have to shut their doors
4775291 some would have to cut back services others would be forced to close their doors
4775292 in the past it is my understanding the unions have been quite successful at blunting cutbacks
4775293 this is a case where the traditional foes the institutions and the workers are together on the same side and it multiplies the influence
4775294 its amazing how hard it can be to come up with 25 when everything is going up in price

4775305 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether these things were so

4775311 rule number 1 for practicing practice what you dont know
4775312 on the web the participants are often sober and they spare no pains to offend and insult one another even when there is nothing at stake i nearly wrote nothing but prestige but prestige in whose eyes who is watching the strange weightless intimacy of online communication has enabled complete strangers to hate each other passionately within minutes this has had measurable effects in the real world in the us for instance the breakup of the anglican communion has already resulted in some huge and juicy lawsuits and will certainly result in many more as conservative parishes try to remove their churches from the liberal central body the schism could never have happened without the internet which allowed each side to see exactly what the other was up to and then deliberately to misunderstand it

4775319 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4775320 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4775321 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4775322 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4775337 we really went quite far in phase ii developing some very advanced systems but many of them are already quite mature and ready for pre deployment validation
4775338 it is almost seamless the picture might freeze for a frame or two but you do not need to reconnect the call or to use a password or anything like that
4775339 the problem with tv over copper wire the telephone network is that you get bursty noise that can result in lost frames or a frozen image it is okay for data because the system can just resend but it is not good enough for video
4775340 many of the iptv services offer time delayed viewing where you can watch something after it is first broadcast
4775341 so we developed a cache system in the access network closer to the home it saves bandwidth on the metro network
4775342 there are lot of companies working in bilateral arrangements to validate many of the technologies we worked on
4775343 intelligence in the access network in particular responds to current problems faced by the telecoms companies and service providers i dont think it will be too long before some of these enhanced services are deployed
4775344 other areas are more long term and work continues on almost every aspect of muse but ultimately it will mean better broadband access and services for europe and the system is designed to evolve too so it should be able to keep pace with new developments

4775401 se tornassi indietro non firmerei il contratto con la juventus perch a verona io giocher per soltanto a causa dellindisponibilit di zidane ma nel caso in cui zizou recuperasse per la partita successiva tornerei in panchina so bene che ancelotti ha in mente unaltra squadra della quale fanno parte del piero e inzaghi ma io non mi sento inferiore a loro
4775402 nella juve nessuno mai stato al suo livello e se in futuro ci sar qualcuno che lo superer lo ammetteremo a malincuore
4775403 la societ deve comprare gente forte che ci permetta di continuare a vincere altrimenti
4775404 a parit di bravura scelgo chi mandare in campo facendo unanalisi del suo segno zodiacale e della situazione delle stelle in quella giornata la regola comunque sarebbe questa pu giocare solo uno scorpione per volta perch altrimenti c il rischio che se ne metto due contemporaneamente giocano soltanto tra di loro li metto insieme solo quando la situazione disperata
4775405 ricapitolando domenech ha la passione dellastrologia uso non convocare gente dello scorpione per esempio pir s e domenica stato tradito proprio da uno scorpione come david trezeguet il quale manco a dirlo era stato anche il pi penalizzato da monsieur raymond durante questo mondiale ascoltando i consigli di henry che ama molto giocare da unica punta e che ha un rendimento nettamente migliore senza di fianco lo juventino domenech aveva scelto di rinunciare a trezeguet poi nella sera decisiva usciti henry e zidane gli toccato nei rigori affidarsi proprio a lui che da scorpione vero ha sbagliato
4775406 cerano dei contatti con il barcellona squadra dove mi sarebbe piaciuto andare perch gioca un gran calcio poi per mi ha telefonato capello e mi ha chiesto sono finite le motivazioni o questione di soldi gli ho risposto che la juve mi aveva fatto una promessa lui mi ha richiamato qualche ora dopo tutto risolto
4775407 mi piace che la gente parli di me per quello che faccio in campo io sono uno sportivo non un personaggio pubblico vivo cos questo quanto mi interessa tanti me lo rimproverano anche la stampa francese i giornalisti dicono che non so vendermi ma va bene cos non faccio le cose perch altri mi dicono di farle mi gestisco alla mia maniera sono rimasto quello che giocava nel platense in argentina io vado in campo gioco mi diverto e poi torno dalla mia famiglia

4775418 very very few people came across the release by reading about it on my site
4775419 the effects are largely reliant on how much word is gotten out i think
4775420 anecdotally a number of people have told me that they bought under my roof after reading move under ground for free
4775421 and a couple of newspapers have given under my roof some good ink it seems after hearing about it through the publicity surrounding move under ground
4775422 what happens when everybody releases their work through a creative commons licence then its no longer newsworthy and while it will certainly continue to make my work more accessible to people who already know of my existence it certainly wont lure in any new readers the way the blindsight campaign has done its a niche strategy in other words it only works as long as most artists arent doing it and as long as thats the case id certainly consider releasing my future books under a cc license
4775423 doctorow has set all of his stuff free with tors blessing
4775424 granted there had been some inconsistency in tors perspective in the past back when cory was offering his first novel under a creative commons license tor was absolutely forbidding me to do the same thing and in fact they even tried to stick a clause in my contract stipulating that i couldnt even post excerpts on my website of more than 1700 words
4775425 it works much better when the source being opened up is more easily adjustable as software is for books stuff the nerd crowd likes sf and fantasy will work best also various experimental texts may also work i wonder if douglas rushkoffs exit strategy which involved reader generated footnotes would have been more successful had it been made totally open to remixing something short but very open ended a choose your own adventure book with an infinity of choices would likely be very popular cced
4775426 and when the novelty wears off ill just have to find some other way of getting attention perhaps i could get some fan to climb up a clock tower and start shooting random pedestrians all the while shouting peter wattss
4775427 i dont care its my life im entitled to live it in a suboptimal way

4775478 non lo voglio pensare giusto un destino con una fine cos faticosa e sento una rabbia che monta sayoro mentre tu suoni verso le stelle contro le stelle suona sayoro se puoi

4775484 how do you find a poem when you know only the title or first line
4775485 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4775486 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4775487 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4775488 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4775489 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4775490 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4775491 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4775492 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4775493 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4775494 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm

4775511 ik ben kwaad en ik ben zeker niet van plan om af te koelen voor ik terugkeer naar het atletendorp ik had misschien meer wedstrijdritme nodig maar dat is geen excuus ik had misschien meer moeten trainen en lopen ik heb geprobeerd om mijn tempo vast te houden met mijn hamstrings ging het nochtans goed zulke dingen gebeuren
4775512 na die vroege uitsluiting moesten we niet te veel nadenken maar reageren
4775513 ik heb geprobeerd er niet te veel bij stil te staan dat ik in zon sterke reeks zat maar toch
4775514 ik wist dat nesterenko zich deze morgen ingehouden had dus we waren met vier voor drie plaatsen dan heb je nog wel die ene snelste verliezende tijd maar met de wind die hier constant draait kan je daar niet op rekenen ik heb geprobeerd mijn eigen ding te doen ook in de laatste meters het belangrijkste was dat ik gefocust bleef op mijn eigen race maar ik verwachtte wel dat nesterenko naast mij zou komen voor morgen zal het afhangen van in welke halve finale ik zit daarmee moet je echt geluk hebben
4775515 iljo had echt geen spanning op de spieren dus bij elke inspanning voelde hij het
4775516 hij heeft wel enkele keren geprobeerd maar als hij echt goed is dan pakt hij veel makkelijker die ronde hij hoopte dat hij een man of vijf zes zou meekrijgen om zo aan een ronde te geraken maar hij kreeg er bij zijn eerste poging slechts eentje mee met twee tegen een jagend peloton is het natuurlijk ondoenbaar hoe het komt weten we niet hij had de laatste dagen wat last van zijn maag en hij heeft ook wat diarree gehad wat natuurlijk ook krachten wegneemt maar of het nu daaraan ligt morgen doet hij een recuperatietraining en maandag trainen hij en kenny de ketele nog eens samen om dan hopelijk dinsdag klaar te zijn voor de ploegkoers
4775517 it was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them turn from your fierce wrath change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people 14and the lord changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people
4775518 i present to you some important matters to present to the people as practical present truth there is no need to dwell upon subjects that are not light and truth we are to think of those things that will give spiritual nourishment
4775519 special truths have been adapted to the conditions of the generations as they have existed the present truth which is a test to the people of this generation was not a test to the people of generations far back if the light which now shines upon us in regard to the sabbath of the fourth commandment had been given to the generations in the past god would have held them accountable for that light those who died before the light was given upon the law of god and the claims of the fourth commandment were not guilty of the sin of violating the seventh day sabbath the wisdom and mercy of god in dispensing light and knowledge at the proper time as the people need it is unsearchable previous to his coming to judge the world in righteousness he sends forth a warning to arouse the people and call their attention to their neglect of the fourth commandment that they may be enlightened and may repent of their transgression of his law and prove their allegiance to the great lawgiver
4775520 he has made provision that all may be holy and happy if they choose sufficient light has been given to this generation that we may learn what our duties and privileges are and enjoy the precious and solemn truths in their simplicity and power we are accountable only for the light that shines upon us the commandments of god and the testimony of jesus are testing us if we are faithful and obedient god will delight in us and bless us as his own chosen peculiar people when perfect faith and perfect love and obedience abound working in the hearts of those who are christs followers they will have a powerful influence light will emanate from them dispelling the darkness around them refining and elevating all who come within the sphere of their influence and bringing to a knowledge of the truth all who are willing to be enlightened and to follow in the humble path of obedience
4775521 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
4775522 lay it all on me i will take your sins i will give you peace banish no longer your self respect for i have bought you with the price of my own blood you are mine your weakened will i will strengthen your remorse for sin i will remove
4775523 lay it all on me i will take your sin i will give you peace destroy no longer your self respect for i have bought you with the price of my own blood you are mine your weakened will i will strengthen your remorse for sin i will remove
4775524 who knows the lord may be gracious to me and the child may live
4775525 faith is real the bible says substance when i pray and find gods will i receive that thing or way and there is an exhilaration that is equal to or more satisfying than if i had it right now because i have jesus whatever he gives is precious
4775526 is faith an emotion faith as a meaning making affective process an example from breast cancer patients
4775527 having cancer isnt a death sentence as everyone is on the road to inevitable it just means that i am more likely to know what is going to kill me than others it also has given me a stronger desire to live life as full as i can and to tell as many as i can about jesus and his grace
4775528 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
4775529 als ich den letzten zug machte dachte ich ich h tte verloren

4775540 the latest strike force has been in operation for near on two years
4775541 the original investigation meanwhile kicked off in 1999 and included a painstaking nationwide manhunt for a man who probably never existed
4775542 a lot of them passed on their best wishes to me and i appreciated that the reaction to janes death is a true indication of how people felt about her she was an inspiration to so many it is hard though when people say theyre sorry for what happened its nice i know theyre being kind but it brings it all back
4775543 the kids are coping well though they get upset about jane when theyre tired and cranky
4775544 she was a great mother and very protective of the kids she thought the bush was a dangerous place for them but i took them there and they were happy
4775545 james and holly enjoyed their time out there by having wonderful adventures i have a deep love for the outback and plan to spend more time there with them
4775546 i want janes memory to be a celebration of her life
4775547 when you think about it she wasnt in australia for all that long it was only a few years really but the impact she had on the country was special
4775548 when i was on the property after janes death rotary were holding a fund raising rally from brewarrina to nyngan and they stopped off at the property for a barbecue lunch
4775549 i hope that our pensioners seniors and working families who are not able to book their flights over the internet will not be unfairly hurt by these new arrangements
4775550 today due to increased security screening it costs us more to process a bag than its owner

4775552 a wages bill is a wages bill and this is information the government itself provided
4775553 teachers police firefighters ambulance officers are all fighting tooth and nail just to keep their heads above water
4775554 the premiers priorities are obviously a little out of whack
4775555 dieser song erinnert mich ganz stark an die olympischen spiele in turin 2006
4775556 wer hat schon so viele trends geschaffen wie madonna ich habe achtung vor
4775557 was frauenpower angeht habe ich von madonna mehr gelernt als von alice schwarzer ich
4775558 man muss nicht fantastisch gut singen um gute musik zu machen ich finde es toll dass
4775559 madonna ist die unumstrittene k nigin der neuerfindungen und die absolute
4775560 ich finde es sch n wenn es eine frau wie madonna gibt die 50 jahre alt wird so
4775561 die freude ber silber berwiegt auch wenn man sich ein wenig ber den knappen abstand von nur einer hundertstel rgert
4775562 die hatten angst wegen der erotischen anspielungen aber sie haben gezahlt sind abgehauen und das wars
4775563 das ist eine sensationelle sache ich kann keinen herausheben es war eine hervorragende teamleistung
4775564 ich h tte mir das nie verziehen wenn wir nicht noch das finale erreicht h tten ich h tte mich umgebracht oder w re ausgewandert
4775565 i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
4775566 unserer meinung nach war sein verhalten auf dem podium und w hrend der siegerehrung nicht angemessen
4775567 sein verhalten widerspricht dem olympischen geist und zeigt keinen respekt f r athleten kollegen
4775568 jegliches fehlverhalten ist eine beleidigung f r andere athleten und die olympische bewegung
4775569 oh war das knapp mir sind mehrere steine vom herzen gefallen ich war am herzkasper
4775570 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4775571 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4775572 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4775573 i know scott wanted to sign and im disappointed it didnt work out for him in the same regard we are all excited he is returning for his senior year in my opinion we have the best pitcher in the southeastern conference returning for his senior year
4775574 im excited about the opportunity to return to ole miss and play baseball
4775575 there is nothing like pitching in front of rebel fans and i am ready to get back out there and do that for another season
4775576 the last mile or last kilometer is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer usually referred to by the telecommunications and cable television industries it is typically seen as an expensive challenge because fanning out wires and cables is a considerable physical undertaking
4775577 what happens i think is when we talk about that i end up back in the middle of that violence and when im in the middle of that violence im really vulnerable and i cant do anything
4775578 i think when we together as two countries say no more its a much stronger stance and i can see the people from canada just being buoyed together by the people from mexico and how in understanding that we share this there can be a new strength and thats exciting
4775579 if its just about talk about this issue we have failed
4775580 the goal is action the goal is to make a difference and that we dont just talk about this and theorize about why or what but when we go back to our corners of the world on monday the world will look different
4775581 we have to start bringing awareness about racism and then how racism is intersected with sexism
4775582 when the two intersect thats when we have brown skinned women the bottom of the link things can happen to them and people dont really care and they can blame them for it happening and it is not acceptable in any vision of the world for that to happen
4775583 i just know that we need to talk about misogyny because this was not a part of our way as aboriginal people and it was not a part of the way of white people if we dont talk about it then we cant change it we cant do anything about it and we need to stop blaming each other as men and women and find a way to be able to get past that for our children
4775584 when my daughter didnt return home i knew something bad had happened
4775585 its been a long struggle and we still dont know her whereabouts
4775586 i spent a long time searching for her i went to bars dance places restaurants and i couldnt find her
4775587 you have to know who is killing these women and why they are being killed and why the people who kill them are not caught
4775588 everything is so secure you have a lot of security in these streets you can walk the street if you dont stop this violence everything is going to go down
4775589 i can look at mirror every morning and say i am in peace with you i have to live with what i know how to do
4775590 i believe you have to change things for the better
4775591 you have to tell society that things are happening its the only way to prevent them from happening again
4775592 if they can do it without punishment they will do it again and again and again
4775593 you have to have zero tolerance of all crimes thats the only way
4775594 i loved robert webbers ancient future faith in it he offered rich resources for contemporary worship mined from our heritage in the ancient church in journey to jesus webber does the same thing in the realm of disciple making its a groundbreaking resource for those of us who are engaging in evangelism as process in our emerging postmodern context the book now in video form encouraged me and stimulated my own creative thinking i kept scribbling notes in the margins with applications for our own church webber is initiating a desperately needed conversation about how churches can make authentic postmodern disciples what a contribution

4775599 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4775600 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4775601 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4775602 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4775603 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4775604 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4775605 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4775606 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4775607 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4775608 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4775609 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

4775614 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4775615 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4775616 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4775617 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4775618 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4775619 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4775620 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4775621 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4775622 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4775623 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4775624 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4775625 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4775626 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4775627 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4775628 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4775629 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4775630 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4775631 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4775632 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4775633 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4775634 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4775635 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4775636 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4775637 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4775638 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4775639 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4775640 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4775641 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4775642 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4775643 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4775644 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4775645 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4775646 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4775647 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4775648 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4775649 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4775650 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4775651 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4775652 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4775653 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4775654 a current summary of the latest content from some of our favorite payments and banking blogs based upon their rss feeds
4775655 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4775656 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4775657 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4775658 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4775659 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4775660 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4775661 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4775662 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4775663 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4775664 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4775665 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4775666 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4775667 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4775668 this is a planning took where all things are going
4775669 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4775670 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4775671 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4775672 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4775673 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4775674 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4775675 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4775676 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4775677 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4775678 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4775679 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4775680 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4775681 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4775689 was sie auf dem foto als bigfoot bezeichnen sieht nicht nat rlich aus
4775690 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4775691 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4775692 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4775693 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4775694 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4775695 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4775696 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4775697 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4775698 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4775699 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4775700 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4775701 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4775702 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4775703 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4775704 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4775705 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4775706 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4775707 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4775708 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4775709 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4775710 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4775711 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4775712 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4775713 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4775714 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4775715 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4775716 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4775717 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4775718 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4775719 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4775720 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4775721 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world

4775729 pastor rick feels that a lot of these debates produce more heat than light and he wanted to give the candidates the opportunity for more long form answers
4775730 when you try to do a middle ground youve got enemies on both sides
4775731 i dont know whats going to happen with the evangelical vote nobodys ever predicted it correctly and i certainly wouldnt try to do that
4775732 its always been misunderstood to be a monolith it isnt
4775733 these rains could produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides

4775737 when we were involved in combat actions as part of the peacekeeping operation bridges were our targets indeed but now when there is peace why should we blow up bridges it is us who would have to restore them we are working hard there

4775754 the league of women voters is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential debate scheduled for mid october because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter
4775755 it has become clear to us that the candidates organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign trail charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions
4775756 the league has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the american public
4775757 neither barr nor nader are currently qualified to participate according to rules set out by the commission on presidential debates a private non profit corporation that has organized debates in the last several presidential election cycles the cpd requires that to be included in their debates candidates must appear on enough state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority of electoral college votes and must be winning at least 15 support in national public opinion polls before the debates
4775758 this election will be won in the political middle and independent voters are the major prize up for grabs it looks like independents want a full debate this fall to get a wider range of views and voices out onto the table

4775841 we did have an incident which took place with a small number of people but the majority of people who have come here today behaved impeccably
4775842 we responded quickly and efficiently and they were not successful in creating the barricade
4775843 and yes but what a shame what a shame the poor grooms bride is a whore
4775844 havent you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door
4775845 some of you might have heard that were developing a web based version of joost well its coming and were excited about it
4775846 this doesnt mean that the joost web service will be available by november 1 only that the company has announced definite plans to develop such a service
4775847 joost the streaming video service from the founders of skype for which users have had to download its client software said itll make a web based version available soon and begin streaming more live content
4775848 that product web based version is weeks away from launch ceo mike volpi tells us
4775849 were told the new web based version will launch later this summer
4775850 this doesnt mean that the joost web service will be available by november 1 only that the company has announced definite plans to develop such a service
4775851 joost will announce a web based viewer by november 1 2008
4775852 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4775853 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4775854 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4775855 its very good that were getting it because up until now if we had a family where somebody was in a wheelchair we had to carry them in
4775856 we had that happen like three weeks ago with a woman who couldnt get up the stairs so this will be something very good for everyone
4775857 coming to the center it can be traumatic anyway but when your mommy cant come in with you its even worse
4775858 we dont set them once a month once every six months once a year if theres a need and we can get out the people to do it we do it
4775859 when something like this comes up its a no brainer
4775860 any other projects we may do are based off the needs in our communities so each one has a certain area like oak grove or purvis
4775861 but these abuse prevention centers those are the focus for all exchange clubs
4775862 the favre foundation paid a lot of money to help get this house
4775863 i think there is a bit of a shock here at how strong we are
4775864 everybody kept asking can they move up another gear have not they peaked too soon now we showed that we could move on and that is a bit of a shock to the other teams i think
4775865 the condition of the patient could not be defined until he is in a coma i can only say he has suffered a heavy brain trauma
4775866 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4775867 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4775868 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4775869 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4775870 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4775871 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4775872 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4775873 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4775874 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4775875 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4775876 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4775877 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4775878 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4775879 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

4775883 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4775884 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4775885 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4775886 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
4775887 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4775888 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4775889 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4775890 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4775891 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4775892 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4775893 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4775894 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4775895 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4775896 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4775897 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4775898 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4775899 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4775900 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4775901 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4775902 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

4775909 many traditionally male industries are beginning to see the value of a diverse work force so women are beginning to be hired more frequently
4775910 unfortunately male coworkers often view these women as affirmative action hires and they have to prove themselves to their male collea
4775911 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4775912 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4775913 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4775914 if its rain if its snow we can still have a race lightning is too dangerous
4775915 i think well be able to deal with it but well see

4775920 yesterday we left stanford at 7 30 heading to paolo altos and then off to la on the highway
4775921 there were a lot of conspiracy theories and there still are understandably in that part of the world
4775922 i said to the pakistanis you are all going to think this is sabotage but i do not have evidence of that we think its mechanical failure we have looked at the records of the us air force we have found a number of failures maybe 20 or 30 where c130s behaved this way
4775923 we cant wait for a plane to drop out of the sky
4775924 initially i thought maybe it was benazirs brother but no one has ever taken credit for it and those things are not the kind of things you do by yourself pakistan is not the kind of place where those things do not come out
4775925 it seems there was a mechanical failure for a c 130 in colorado and the same thing happened a c 130 had gone into gyrations in the air over colorado it was not as close to the ground they pulled it out
4775926 it was the steering mechanism is the way he described it to me it did not crash but it went through these gyrations up in the air and the pilot pulled it out i had always thought c130s were the workhorses of the air i was quite surprised when the air force described to me what they had discovered
4775927 these pilots did not have much experience flying c130s and they flew so low
4775928 the use of a chemical agent to incapacitate the pilots and thus perpetuate the accident therefore remains a distinct possibility

4775931 any commercial agreement or association with the eec was a threat to finlands peaceful foreign policy
4775932 is not a story of russian aggression but of us imperial expansion
4775933 unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome
4775934 regime change becomes the first requirement for any movement on any front this will be putins refrain in the coming days he is counting on europe to pressure saakashvili to resign and or flee to give peace a chance
4775935 non interference coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of great power spheres of influence is still a roughly stable basis for international relations
4775936 the democracies are making their usual mistakes ignoring even recent history interpreting the facts in the way most favourable to moscow the way the kremlin wants them to choose
4775937 what started out as a neutral role became a front for pursuing neo imperial russian objectives had we pushed for real neutral peacekeeping forces we might have prevented this war
4775938 in spite of this the west never had a plan to shield georgia from the possible fallout
4775939 president bush has on several key occasions failed to raise our commitment to georgia in meetings with putin including right after the nato summit
4775940 some eu leaders profess the need to stay neutral in the conflict while georgia is being destroyed
4775941 the response was that he might want to go sooner and that september might be too late
4775942 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
4775943 time is never wasted when youre wasted all the time
4775944 it came out well i was able to achieve the gold medal which i have wanted for a very long time
4775945 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4775946 if i am ready to swim and win in an olympic final with the best swimmers in the world
4775947 then i am ready to tackle the media the difficult part is behind me i gave up a lot of things to concentrate on my training so easier things are before me im pretty much ready for anything
4775948 it is a wonderful beautiful medal it is something huge when you look at the level of performance in these races it is not any worse than the 100 meter gold it is the same value
4775949 a little bit lower than what i was able to do today
4775950 i havent achieved the time i am looking for the rest is a secret when i reach it ill let you know
4775951 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4775952 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4775953 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4775954 i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4775955 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4775956 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4775957 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4775958 but im taking what i got and im very happy
4775959 i almost won the gold and if you ask me the clock does not lie
4775960 if you ask me it should be accepted and we should move on
4775961 ive accepted defeat and theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4775962 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4775963 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4775964 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4775965 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4775966 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4775967 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4775968 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4775969 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4775970 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4775971 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4775972 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4775973 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4775974 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4775975 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4775976 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4775977 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4775978 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4775979 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4775980 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4775981 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4775982 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4775983 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4775984 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4775985 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4775986 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4775987 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4775988 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4775989 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4776017 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
4776018 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
4776019 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
4776020 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodlinga fact that the evidence will bear out in court

4776023 american troops would join the polish military at least temporarily at the front lines facing east toward russia
4776024 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4776025 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4776026 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4776027 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
4776028 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack by giving the usa permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
4776029 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4776030 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4776031 it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier us technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions
4776032 particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
4776033 the days of satellites and spheres of influence are behind us
4776034 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4776035 the fighting which broke out over the weekend between russia and georgia has brought israels intensive involvement in the region into the limelight this involvement includes the sale of advanced weapons to georgia and the training of the georgian armys infantry forces

4776053 vi spiller en god kamp og den bliver stj let fra os til sidst af de svenske dommere
4776054 it was our first game and i think we did a good job
4776055 it was important to win the game we were a bit nervous especially they played well with the long ball and it was not easy for us
4776056 it was not easy for us but it was very good because we wanted to win our first game and start well
4776057 i think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us because it is just the beginning of the season
4776058 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game but they are a great side
4776059 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4776060 we had a few problems down the right side and they capitalised on that but once we sorted out the problems we performed a lot better
4776061 there are a lot of positives to take from the game we dont go away hammered and go away believing we can compete in this league but there is plenty to work to do
4776062 toward the finish line i couldnt tell if i made it to the finals or not
4776063 three weeks four weeks off because of the injury after running 9
4776064 i felt like i was just starting to get into my rhythm i knew it was gonna take lot more than 61 meters and i dont think it was enough
4776065 i thought my second throw was farther than it was the last one i pepped too much and went out of the ring there is a potential for big reward but theres also a lot of risk im in good shape it was just trying to make it to that next level
4776066 i felt a little sluggish thats sometimes how you feel the first day i want to get faster each round i wanted to get in the top three and thats what i did i could have pushed for first but i just wanted to get through
4776067 i felt very good i came out hard and ran the first 200 well when i came off the curve i wanted to make sure i secured the win i never worry about time i was surprised to see 50 seconds i thought it was a 51 pace race
4776068 im very pleased with my performance today i was pleased with my time it was faster than just about every third place time i have not had a race since the olympic trials because of my knee it was doing ok but over the last three or four days my knee has become a problem ive got some swelling it wasnt until today that it started to go down
4776069 it wasnt pretty but the goal was to get over any way you can it was a lighter pole than i was used to
4776070 i dont think i was prepared i went for a little much but i guess it wasnt my day i felt like i have more experience and i learned from it the plan was to go 4 30 4 40 4 50 and 4 50 made it in it shouldnt have been that hard to do but it turned out that it was i didnt really execute any of my jumps well im coming away disappointed i wasnt prepared for all the excitement and emotion my biggest meet before this was the u s trials i went out there and gave it my best but sometimes when you go out there and give it your best and its just not enough
4776071 i struggled a little bit in the beginning i dont know what happened but each bar got better and better and i got through to the final

4776119 the picture is perhaps truffauts most visually beautiful work the soft palette nestor almendros shot the film evokes the impressionist paintings and looks perhaps deliberately a bit like the old two tone technicolor
4776120 the sun was making waves of light on the hull recounted cameraman nestor almendros
4776121 when you have a picture with light like that its worth a whole line of dialogue
4776122 fran ois truffaut was one of five young french film critics writing for andr bazins cahiers du cinema in the early 1950s who became the leading french filmmakers of their generation unlike his friend and contemporary jean luc godard truffaut remained consistently committed to his highly formal themes of art and life film and fiction youth and education art and education rather than venturing into radical political critiques of film forms and film imagery
4776123 a passionately romantic humanist like renoir truffaut was also a devout admirer of the skills of hitchcock which he attempted to emulate in several of his own thrillers he published a book of a series of interviews he conducted with hitchcock whom he repeatedly identified as his idol but temperamentally and emotionally his affinity with renoir seemed to be the stronger side of his split artistic personality
4776124 in his lesser films he tended to rely too flagrantly on sentimental charm melodramatic contrivance and romantic whimsy and an insistent fascination with the mystery of women his finest work however is precariously but deftly balanced between sympathetic involvement with his characters doubts frustration and confusion and gently ironic detachment accordingly he favoured the medium close up and medium shot linear but subtly elliptical narratives and occasionally voiceover narration literary in tone
4776125 a seminal director in the french new wave truffaut is a master at illustrating the small joys and sorrows of human existence with a particular talent for understanding children

4776158 i said to the pakistanis you are all going to think this is sabotage but i do not have evidence of that we think its mechanical failure we have looked at the records of the us air force we have found a number of failures maybe 20 or 30 where c130s behaved this way
4776159 we cant wait for a plane to drop out of the sky
4776160 initially i thought maybe it was benazirs brother but no one has ever taken credit for it and those things are not the kind of things you do by yourself pakistan is not the kind of place where those things do not come out
4776161 it seems there was a mechanical failure for a c 130 in colorado and the same thing happened a c 130 had gone into gyrations in the air over colorado it was not as close to the ground they pulled it out
4776162 it was the steering mechanism is the way he described it to me it did not crash but it went through these gyrations up in the air and the pilot pulled it out i had always thought c130s were the workhorses of the air i was quite surprised when the air force described to me what they had discovered
4776163 these pilots did not have much experience flying c130s and they flew so low
4776164 the use of a chemical agent to incapacitate the pilots and thus perpetuate the accident therefore remains a distinct possibility
4776165 i think ill put on shorts and a t shirt and play beach volleyball

4776176 het is verdiend itali en belgi zijn aan elkaar gewaagd maar wij hebben een betere mentaliteit
4776177 de ploeg was goed en ik ook ik was wat ziekjes voor de match maar dat was snel over
4776178 ik denk dat iedereen droomt van dit soort matchen de spelers hebben schitterend gereageerd op die vroege rode kaart
4776179 we waren de beste ploeg in de tweede helft en gaven na de rust weinig weg
4776180 de groep was de uitblinker met tien tegen elf italianen bij wie verdedigen in hun cultuur zit
4776181 we willen naar de finale ja op n match is alles mogelijk dat is vandaag bewezen het wordt moeilijker en moeilijker maar het moreel is heel goed
4776182 ik ben heel blij dat de ploeg met tien man toch de klus geklaard heeft maar ik mis wel de halve finale
4776183 ik ga niet moeilijk doen over die kaart ik heb de beelden gezien er was contact de ref kon de bal zeker op de stip leggen
4776184 daarna heb ik met veel trots naar de ploeg gekeken ik was verbaasd toen ik plaatsnam in de tribunes en er 1 2 op het scorebord stond

4776194 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4776195 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4776196 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4776197 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4776198 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage

4776213 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4776214 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4776215 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out friday will definitely be a much better day this week but we want to keep building on the momentum
4776216 i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
4776217 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4776218 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization
4776219 you still have to keep in mind that if you take a chance and dont finish a race that youll lose a lot of points and the 10 bonus points for a win you thought you might gain for the chase wont happen either
4776220 you have to do the same things that have gotten you to victory lane in the past you cant afford to take too many unnecessary chances
4776221 my brother kurt moved up to michigan years ago to run in the craftsman truck series and he went to a michigan game
4776222 he bought me a michigan sweat shirt and sent it home for me i never really paid attention to college football until then but i became a michigan fan

4776224 there is a lot more stress in making the chase than there is in the chase itself most of these tracks in the chase you have been to once already this season and have a baseline of what to expect there are good tracks for us in the chase like lowes motor speedway and talladega

4776234 the georgian south ossetian conflict issue was considered during a meeting of the russian security council and the president informed those attending that he had just signed the plan based on the six principles
4776235 we are somewhat bewildered by the fact that the document signed by saakashvili differs from the document worked out by the presidents of russia and france so the issue is still to be specified via diplomatic channels
4776236 the wealth of technical talent we find here has allowed us to expand this quickly we also are able to bring world class talent here from both the east and west coasts

4776254 there will be a physical conversion of the building twice a year
4776255 they have had their eyes on that building for many years
4776256 when coran bought the building there were talks with the opera company
4776257 but everything on everyones wish list was a budget buster
4776258 were all very excited about the prospect of moving to the jefferson and not having to deal with mud and heat
4776259 its just a small basement and crawl space right now
4776260 but it will have a simple elegance already contained in the original design
4776261 after the first 10 minutes i want to go home and scr after the first 20 minutes i never want to scr again
4776262 i have to give props to the 10th and page neighborhood
4776263 we were surprised by the push back we hadnt anticipated wed have that sort of visceral over the top reaction
4776264 this is a community already burdened and is in a nip and tuck battle with street crime drugs
4776265 the trash on 10th street is deplorable i mean were talking glass condoms
4776266 it became clear we would not have a favorable outcome
4776267 i think there would have definitely been a vote against it
4776268 with a special use permit which is something over and above the norm you need to do your work with the neighborhood
4776269 its our business so we wanted to find a temporary venue local acts like sons of bill and sparkys flaw have outgrown the small ones weve looked at so many buildings but there are not a lot of options
4776270 after the first 10 minutes i want to go home and scr after the first 20 minutes i never want to scr again
4776271 im very happy to be acquitted but i dont agree with the decision
4776272 i do not agree that rick krial or the company are guilty
4776273 that the people of the city of staunton have spoken on behalf of their friends and neighbors and spoken out about how they feel about this stuff
4776274 ive never seen a verdict like this when the acts in the movies were so close in context
4776275 the jury felt that the tape that didnt contain multiple partners was not obscene
4776276 it seems to me thats a lot of why the jury decided the way they did
4776277 my best guess is they drew a line with sugar britches since it was all one on one
4776278 particularly that the prosecution brought the child pornography theme into this that prejudiced the jury and i feel its reversible
4776279 has no pubic hair no breasts and an angular body type typically this is someone whose body has not yet fully developed sexually in most industrialized countries this occurs at the age of 12
4776280 and that the jury will find it equally if not more gross
4776281 you know my father always said matt keep an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out
4776282 the defendants gambled they came into this town and thought that no one would care well someone did mr robertson cared and now he gives this case to you
4776283 this country is all about individual rights in a community in 2008 not 1958
4776284 if i put a picture from playboy on a billboard along route 250 that would exceed community standards but if i choose to purchase one of these dvds take it home and watch it in the privacy of my home no reasonable adult would say thats unacceptable under the circumstances
4776285 they collect money for that license if nothing else thats proof that the community accepts this material thats like you getting your drivers license driving home and then when you get there they arrest you because they say youre not allowed to drive what the hecks the license for
4776286 there was a guy having sex with a girl in her vagina and another guy having sex in her anus
4776287 there were two guys with their penises in the same vagina six times a man pulled his penis out of a womans anus and put it directly in her mouth if were influenced by what we see what do you think that does to a town
4776288 if you want this stuff go buy it where they dont care about morals and decency but dont turn staunton virginia into las vegas
4776289 staunton may be a small light shining in the darkness these days but dont put it out let it live and let it maybe be the first domino that reverses this junk
4776290 the last chapter in this book has yet to be written thats for sure
4776291 after the first 10 minutes i want to go home and scr after the first 20 minutes i never want to scr again
4776292 im here as a politician representing one of the worlds oldest democracies to show support for one of the worlds newest we are absolutely right to stand by a country its democracy and its territorial integrity when it has been violated in this way
4776293 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4776294 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4776295 when david cameron matches his tough talk on expanding nato more quickly with a pledge to double defence spending or introduce military conscription perhaps then we could take him seriously
4776296 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4776297 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4776298 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4776299 police were called to the premises at 7 48pm on thursday august 14 where they found the body lying on the remains of a bonfire in the grounds
4776300 police are treating the death as unexplained at present and are hoping that the results of the post mortem forensic tests and other available evidence will enable them to focus the inquiry in a positive direction
4776301 i just didnt stick to my race plan and got pushed about a bit
4776302 there was a bit of a flat period in the third quarter other than that i was pretty pleased with the players
4776303 the discipline was good the boys were getting very frustrated out there there were hands on the ball the 10 metres was non existent at times and it was hard to get any momentum
4776304 were getting confidence yet we know there is a whole lot more in us
4776305 im still trying to work out why we got a man sent to the sin bin im very frustrated with that we really didnt get a chance
4776306 he was respectful but there had been trouble at this party
4776307 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4776308 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4776309 after the first 10 minutes i want to go home and scr after the first 20 minutes i never want to scr again

4776331 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4776332 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4776333 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4776334 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4776335 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think liverpool will close the gap this season as well
4776336 it will be interesting to see how arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4776337 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4776338 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4776339 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4776340 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4776341 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4776342 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4776343 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again
4776344 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4776345 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4776346 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups in scotland and doing well in the champions league
4776347 i am looking forward to the challenges here and hope to play my part in further honours
4776348 get an education do well in class get a well paid job get married have kids work to earn a living to feed the kids buy house buy car work work work buy better houses buy better cars work work work
4776349 i hope your voice keeps going after so many takes
4776350 so this is it this is my proclamation im not saying this to impress anybody im not saying this to brag im not saying this to make people feel sorry for me im saying this for reasons of accountability todays august 15 2007 and i will not be accepting any applications until august 15 2008 and i want you to know that why because ive made this kind of commitment before and ive backed down on it right now i have around 310 friends on myspace i think at least 80 will read this and i want you to absolutely ridicule me if i fail im making this commitment to god today in front of you please keep me in check

4776413 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do

4776454 july 15 1952 this is for the africans site by the way link at the end of the post
4776455 if a valuable asset a grazing field say is held in common each individual will try to exploit as much of it as possible
4776456 if too many people own individual parts of a valuable asset its easy to end up with gridlock since any one person can simply veto the use of the asset
4776457 if we all go for the blonde and block each other not a single one of us is going to get her so then we go for her friends but they will all give us the cold shoulder because no one likes to be second choice but what if none of us goes for the blonde we wont get in each others way and we wont insult the other girls its the only way to win its the only way we all get laid
4776458 in this the time and age people love to watch black verse white good verse evil it gives us hope
4776459 i cant wait to get home and talk to my friends and get a pat on the back its awesome i love it
4776460 its awesome to have a famous family member and hopefully now ill become famous too
4776461 im a nervous person and cant keep still when shooting so i walk around a lot it helps me calm down ive only had a handful of shoot outs before and lost as many as ive won i tried to focus on the positive side and keep focused
4776462 to have a chance against him i knew i needed at least a 25 and maybe even a 26 in the 25 target final
4776463 then he gave me one that i wasnt expecting so we got the shoot out he won it hes a great shooter and a great friend
4776464 i dont see silver as failure it was an inspiration for me to have the king and queen behind me watching

4776466 the term cancer covers a wide range of conditions with variable presentations variable rates of biological progression and varying complexities of diagnosis and treatment
4776467 there are those which may progress to patient detriment within this 62 day target and those that will not
4776468 for patients with squamous carcinoma of lung and a potential doubling time of less than two weeks a 62 day target is clearly inappropriate
4776469 the initiative however does not provide the most appropriate measure of cancer care and has serious flaws particularly in the damage it has done to clinical audit of treatment and outcome
4776470 these demands are clinically unnecessary and current timelines could be relaxed
4776471 an interval of six to nine months would still allow timely monitoring and simultaneous collection of data for both clinical audit and waiting times without unnecessary duplication of effort
4776472 now is the time to refocus attention to quality of care and clinical audit rather than waiting times
4776473 its written by clinicians who are actively managing patients with cancer and these are our clinical concerns

4776480 look i am not a moron i know that apartheid politicians klan leaders and bigots of all stripes have always defended their intolerance on some perceived biological difference between people of their fair skinned races and those of the darker i realize that what has helped uphold this argument is the caricature of the black man as an uncivilized buffoon hardly more evolved than the gorillas but i am not that person ive read satire ive made my living as a writer i know things and i know that this caricature is unfair therefore i shall adopt this persona satirically in order to undermine the untenable viewpoint i put forward in my article

4776485 so it is very useful and precious to have a like minded person to talk with st seraphim said if you want to put yourself into disorder talk with another man of another turn of mind and experience shows this to be true sometimes speaking with another person is simply a rest while speaking with another is heavy it is close to a quarrel there is little to say one is thinking how to get away as soon as possible

4776529 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4776530 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4776531 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4776572 the five hotels are getting together to merchandise del mar as a brand location and raise its profile
4776573 traditionally the hotel community is against increases in tot hotel taxes that dont identify funds for marketing
4776574 when you raise tot and you dont dedicate money to marketing or even a portion you can lose market share from that standpoint you are not as competitive
4776575 if you look around you see solana beach just to the north has passed a tax at 13 percent and it certainly doesnt seem to be out of line to me
4776576 it was their idea it helps them and helps the city

4776580 as of information we have right now he is the mastermind of the blasts and this network is the brains behind the blasts
4776581 we were on his lookout for the past several days ever since we were tipped off about his presence in uttar pradesh
4776582 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4776583 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4776584 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4776585 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4776586 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us
4776587 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down for another night out there so we got prepared to stick through another tough night
4776588 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm
4776589 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking oh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried
4776590 and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break
4776591 it was amazing yesterday morning to again hear the sound of a helicopter we heard it fly over the back of the ridge
4776592 as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again
4776593 we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up
4776594 finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility when it did finally see us everyone was just jumping up and down cheering
4776595 they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4776596 having designers in house is not cheaper than hiring an external firm
4776597 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner of nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4776598 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4776599 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want we are not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4776600 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4776601 the deployment of the new missile defense forces in europe is aimed at russia so fairy tales about deterring some rogue states with the help of these facilities do not work

4776605 nak ambil segelas air dan dua genggam garam bawalah kemari biar kuperbaiki suasana hatimu itu
4776606 coba ambil segenggam garam dan masukkan ke segelas air itu
4776607 segala masalah dalam hidup itu seperti segenggam garam tidak kurang tidak lebih hanya segenggam garam banyaknya masalah dan penderitaan yang harus kau alami sepanjang kehidupanmu itu sudah dikadar oleh allah sesuai untuk dirimu jumlahnya tetap segitu segitu saja tidak berkurang dan tidak bertambah setiap manusia yang lahir ke dunia ini pun demikian tidak ada satu pun manusia walaupun dia seorang nabi yang bebas dari penderitaan dan masalah
4776608 tapi nak rasa asin dari penderitaan yang dialami itu sangat tergantung dari besarnya qalbu hati yang menampungnya jadi nak supaya tidak merasa menderita berhentilah jadi gelas jadikan qalbu dalam dadamu itu jadi sebesar danau

4776614 the fact that 10 member unions have signaled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4776615 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signaling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4776616 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4776617 this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited and the tournaments commercial partners it also ensures that future development investment initiatives in the game worldwide can continue to be underwritten by the tournament and planned accordingly

4776619 5 11 08 while the normal timestamps appear in the format
4776620 i know diego is really crucial for us in terms of how we want to play especially coming out from the back through the midfield hell be missed but reidys a really superb passer of the ball anyway and very experienced
4776621 hes always looking forward always one step ahead hes another one who hasnt had much game time either over the past couple of months so we just have to assess how he goes as well
4776622 but hes a very good professional and does everything asked of him and more so it wont be a problem hes a fighter and thats going to be extremely important
4776623 weve tried him a couple of times in midfield and just feel that hes quite young and just a bit raw to go in there at this point in time but certainly hes played most of his football as a left back so he shouldnt have a problem
4776624 maam i cant quite see the connectors can you shine a little more light back there and move the camera in just a bit closer
4776625 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4776626 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4776627 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4776628 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different the most important thing is the actions during the game
4776629 we feel we were a fraction short last year by not much
4776630 we want to show we can get the four points which made the difference last year between us and the winner
4776631 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4776632 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4776633 we learnt an important lesson out of the petero civoniceva incident and were determined to do everything in our power to make sure the misbehaviour of a few does not ruin things for the vast majority of fans
4776634 weve identified a number of people who are known for unacceptable behaviour and in some cases we have banned them for extended periods
4776635 the message is clear if you misbehave you will be caught and action will be taken
4776636 ive often said we have the best fans in the league and through their actions they continue to prove it
4776637 we want our home games to be a place people are comfortable coming to and i believe were very close to ensuring that
4776638 passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really very poor game skill wise
4776639 it was an a grade game tonight not a first grade game
4776640 defensively were miles ahead of where we were at the start of the year
4776641 thats come through hard work and a great attitude from the players and i guess tonight really showed that and won us the game
4776642 defence won the night and it was great from our boys
4776643 we dropped a little bit of ball and so did they but particularly earlier in the year if we hadve done that we had tries scored against us and tonight we didnt which goes to show the attitude from now compared to then
4776644 im surprised im not sure what the problem was to me thats the sort of thing thats been happening since 1908
4776645 it is really increasingly financial suicide to consider using avid
4776646 film and tvs next generation is growing up on apples cheaper platform
4776647 apples model conflicts with our business plan which is to charge our customers several times for the same software
4776648 apples model conflicts with our business plan which is to prevent the user from owning software theyve already paid for
4776649 apples concern for the iphones battery life and customer experience conflicts with our software which was designed with the assumption that background applications would be supported and that our customers value our software more than battery life
4776650 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 per cent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4776651 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4776652 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4776653 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4776654 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4776655 he wont play tomorrow and his next target is our first home game with bolton wanderers next weekend
4776656 its a tough target but one we are hoping he will get to
4776657 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4776658 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4776659 we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic
4776660 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4776661 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4776662 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4776663 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4776664 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4776665 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4776666 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different
4776667 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4776668 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4776669 what if i said something or did something really bad or inappropriate and the wrong person overheard or saw it
4776670 thank you i think if you liked them that is

4776675 the term cancer covers a wide range of conditions with variable presentations variable rates of biological progression and varying complexities of diagnosis and treatment
4776676 there are those which may progress to patient detriment within this 62 day target and those that will not
4776677 for patients with squamous carcinoma of lung and a potential doubling time of less than two weeks a 62 day target is clearly inappropriate
4776678 the initiative however does not provide the most appropriate measure of cancer care and has serious flaws particularly in the damage it has done to clinical audit of treatment and outcome
4776679 these demands are clinically unnecessary and current timelines could be relaxed
4776680 an interval of six to nine months would still allow timely monitoring and simultaneous collection of data for both clinical audit and waiting times without unnecessary duplication of effort
4776681 now is the time to refocus attention to quality of care and clinical audit rather than waiting times
4776682 its written by clinicians who are actively managing patients with cancer and these are our clinical concerns

4776693 the response of the west to russias invasion has been to dress up in tough rhetoric a helpless message
4776694 those who confidently predict a containable and deterrable nuclear iran should consider the suddenly not so deterrable nuclear russia and ask themselves whether such confidence is warranted
4776695 that is where iran comes into play the ayatollahs are glued to their television screens waiting to see how the west responds after all in recent years moscow has stood by irans side in the face of mounting western pressure russia has been supplying iran with materials for its nuclear program and the kremlin is planning to ship advanced anti aircraft systems to the iranians that are aimed at making it harder for israel or the u s to take out their nuclear installations
4776696 as the obama camp was quick to point out mccain opposed legislation that would have forced the u s government to buy american made motorcycles

4776700 in that last couple of strokes i thought we had it but im really pleased to have come away with something
4776701 it was hard out there i was very calm before todays race i didnt think i was ready for it but as soon as i pulled on a skinsuit something kicked in
4776702 coming into a distance race like this and with it being my only individual event i was nervous beforehand this means a lot

4776704 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4776705 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make

4776708 absolutely i would absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation absolutely i would i think people first need to ask forgiveness and then earn trust back over time can trust be re earned absolutely but it takes time

4776714 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
4776715 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them

4776798 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4776799 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4776800 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4776801 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4776802 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4776803 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4776804 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4776805 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4776806 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4776807 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4776808 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4776809 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4776810 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4776811 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4776812 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4776813 this event has turned into one of the highlights of my year
4776814 i cant think of a better way to spend an october day in nashville than riding motorcycles in the afternoon and playing guitars and singing with some buddies at sundown everyone has been so supportive and im really proud of the money weve been able to raise for vanderbilt over the last few years
4776815 its so befitting of michael to do it like that i won a race by a hundredth of a second like he did and im not giving my medal back
4776816 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4776817 this thing michael did is probably going to spur a lot more life into me
4776818 i was going to be trite and say to him and ask him this question what was the most difficult race and when did you know you had a chance to win seven gold medals
4776819 i dont have to it was tonight and it was epic
4776820 i think hes got a real future in our business
4776821 the biggest problem was landing the surveillance pod was slung under its belly so the spy drone had to flip on to its back to avoid damaging the equipment on landing but too many crash landed and bits fell off
4776822 41 road projects which had been calculated to cost 4 45bn will now cost taxpayers 8 12bn a rise of almost 83 per cent one stretch of the a14 between ellington and fen ditton in cambridgeshire had risen from an estimated 490m in 2003 to 1 2bn improvements to a stretch of the a46 between newark and widmerpool in nottinghamshire will run to more than three times the original costing of 82m the highways agency is criticised for basing its inflation predictions on the retail price index which tracks the prices of household items at a time when high global demand for building materials means inflation in the construction industry is much higher
4776823 take the yngling sailing event for women at which great britain won gold in 2004 only about four crews at present compete in the uk with fewer than 100 competitive crews on the planet why because it costs more than 20 000 to buy a decent boat you may as well include formula one in the olympics in rowing sailing and equestrianism there were 186 medals on offer at the last olympics not one was won by an athlete from a low income nation
4776824 58 per cent of great britains gold medal winners at athens in 2004 went to independent schools in the past three olympics 45 per cent of medal winners went to the non state sector given that only 7 per cent of children attend independent schools and assuming that sporting talent is spread evenly this is a striking demonstration of how olympic success is driven by wealth as well as by ability either way the 93 per cent who attend state schools are chronically under represented
4776825 1 2 3 is a hit 1965 song written and recorded by len barry
4776826 it was never considered pop material but it somehow got passed on to us and we fell in love with it immediately
4776827 john had a semi acoustic gibson guitar it had a pick up on it so it could be amplified we were just about to walk away to listen to a take when john leaned his guitar against the amp i can still see him doing it and it went nnnnnnwahhhhh
4776828 the first time i heard bob dylan i was in the car with my mother listening to wmca and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody had kicked open the door to your mind
4776829 wild theories vitriol and dogma have called into question his credibility
4776830 you may remember corsi for his sober allegations that hillary clinton is a lesbian that john kerry is both a jew and a communist and his allegations that muslims actually worship satan you may remember jerome corsi for his recent book attacking the liberal myth that oil is a finite resource since he jerome corsi has learned how to make new oil

4776838 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4776839 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4776840 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4776841 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4776842 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4776843 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4776844 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4776845 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4776846 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4776847 a statment is not hearsay if t he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross examination concerning the statement and the statement is one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person
4776848 although norrid claims it is not entirely clear the trial court applied the correct analysis in deciding whether this showup was suggestive the courts decision states it does seem to me that the setting was suggestive in that the defendant was in handcuffs and he was surrounded by police and there was a spotlight shining on him and no other options were presented to the victim the court effectively decided this showup was suggestive however that decision does not end the inquiry which then turns to whether the identification was unnecessarily or impermissibly suggestive the trial court examined the reasons why the identification was conducted in this manner citing law enforcement concerns about apprehending the right person as quickly as possible so if there was a perpetrator still at large norrid could be released and law enforcement could pursue the perpetrator similar reasons have generally sufficed to support a decision an identification was not unnecessarily suggestive
4776849 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4776850 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4776851 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4776852 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4776853 it used to be the term stayat home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4776854 to the mall the playground play dates to target just to go somewhere
4776855 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4776856 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4776857 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4776858 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4776859 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4776860 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4776861 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic dificulties
4776862 we are not staying home with our children by default
4776863 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4776864 often theyre the ones in charge of household ffnances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening

4776890 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

4776892 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4776893 our party has been a no majority party for a long time the fact is that the democratic party is made up of lots of different people
4776894 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white excuse me in the republican party
4776895 it is disappointing to see howard dean trying to use gender and race to divide voters his comments are insulting inappropriate and have no place in this election
4776896 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue
4776897 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4776898 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

4776900 the chief executive of the company behind the guitar hero video game franchise has hit out at warner music after the label said higher royalties should be paid for use of its songs
4776901 in a sign of increasing tensions between the two companies robert kotick chief executive of activision blizzard said warner music had failed to acknowledge the benefits to music sales from guitar hero
4776902 mr kotick told the financial times that edgar bronfman warner music s chief executive had made one sided comments that were not respectful of how much we ve done to bring new audiences into the market
4776903 activision recently merged with vivendi s games unit vivendi owns universal music the world s largest music publisher
4776904 mr kotick said there was a direct link between artists featured in guitar hero and sales of their music
4776905 oh wait your product is doing well i should have asked for more
4776906 it reminds me of where i grew up on long island
4776907 i cant emphasize enough how important staging a home is
4776908 buyers have to be able to see themselves in a property if they cant they move right on
4776909 the most important aspect of staging is editing and reducing clutter buyers will automatically assume that if the house cant hold your stuff it wont hold theirs either
4776910 they must smell well but not like an overwhelming deodorizer that is trying to decoy other smells pets can be a problem there is nothing worse than an a house that smells like dogs except a house that smells like dogs and french vanilla
4776911 of course austin is a dog friendly town so you can leave them if theyre very friendly and wont attack the buyers
4776912 add an element of warmth and natural beauty to any home but its important to not have too many plants because it can overwhelm a buyer and the plants should be in perfect shape if not move em out
4776913 also you want a variety of things on the bookshelf so that you can appeal to as many buyers as possible while i would love a shelf full of books some buyers might be intimidated by it they also make huge generalizations and assumptions like this home isnt for me because i dont like to read makes no sense but it happens all of the time
4776914 have to remember that if they really want to sell their house they have to be as universally appealing to as many buyers as possible
4776915 i once had a seller that refused to take down his hunting trophies including many taxidermied animals
4776916 they were his pride and joy but no one looked at his house the animals even freaked out buyers looking at the photos

4776918 if fidel is a communist put me on the list hes got the right idea
4776919 the sign was part of the campaign by the party and by fidel to prepare the population for communism which most knew little about the idea was that since fidel had already made his name synonymous with the cuban messiah he must be right about communism
4776920 five or six days later in the wee hours of the morning they came to my house my mothers room was closest to the front door so she heard the knock and got up to see who was there when she opened the door the men pushed her out of the way and rushed into the house i awoke with a machine gun against my temple
4776921 until fidel castro dies there will be no changes in cuba fidel will not permit it the terror imposed since 1959 continues today and ra l will not dare make a single change as long as his older brother is alive
4776922 but those moments are unpredictable which is why he cannot be seen in public or on live television even for a minute
4776923 more repressive as my group the plantados refused to accept rehabilitation everyday they tried to come up with new ways to torture us
4776924 all repressive methods and tactics have failed to force a certain group of counterrevolutionary prisoners into accepting political rehabilitation
4776925 they must have thought the plan and the planners were simply crazy so they never even bothered to come for us
4776926 we felt that the world had turned its back on the prisoners of conscience in cuba
4776927 he was very nice to me at first because he didnt realize who i was
4776928 eighteen years after i was jailed there were already thousands murdered tortured boitel had already died
4776929 i told the spanish ambassador congratulations your report is very good
4776930 castro is still there because the world envies the u s and all that hatred for the u s has gone to support fidel castro
4776931 the old guard will try to maintain the status quo but there are many young officers who do not have blood on their hands and who wont want to fight for a system that has failed and is dying

4776938 living in a foreign language a memoir of food wine and love in italy
4776939 the greatest way to transition from new york time to umbria time is to go to my favorite butcher ugo here in our little village and order essentially a quarter pound of his prosciutto
4776940 he very very slowly slices this prosciutto artfully beautifully twenty or twenty five minutes later you get your quarter pound of ham but you also have arrived in italy youre on italian time
4776941 all the rooms old and new have these wonderful shutters
4776942 after breakfast you close the shutters and the house keeps quite cool in the evening when the sun dips down behind the mountains and the breeze picks up you reopen them
4776943 thought we were crazy but we had to have that shower
4776944 but there was a lot less to choose from because the building rules are tighter here they really dont let you develop anything
4776945 when we started it was inhabitable but it had a few flaws
4776946 we discovered when we were digging that the old house didnt have proper foundations
4776947 fixing that cost something like 3 000 more so it wasnt a tragedy we came in plus or minus 5 000 on the original budget which i admit is rare
4776948 we used all local handmade terra cotta tiles wherever we used new tiles on the roof and the floors
4776949 for the new exterior stone work the stone all comes from the local san terenziano quarry
4776950 this is where the heavy questioning comes in we have to find out where that girl is
4776951 we believe that the network of simi was behind the blasts
4776952 today is a big day for the gujarat police who have been able to crack the ahmadabad blasts case
4776953 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4776954 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4776955 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

4776959 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements

4776979 president bush is guiding u s relations with russia in a decidedly confrontational direction evoking memories of cold war bitterness
4776980 its a marked turnabout from the sense of his soul epiphany the president had seven years ago when he declared that vladimir putin was a trustworthy partner on the global stage
4776981 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming said janusz bugajski director of a new european democracies project at the center for strategic and international studies in washington
4776982 putin is the only world leader who landed the bush reward trifecta visits to the presidents texas ranch the camp david retreat in marylands catoctin mountains and his parents summer home in maine
4776983 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4776984 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4776985 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4776986 they signed a ceasefire but saakashvili can start bombing us again any minute
4776987 look how many people died here we can never join georgia after this well cope on our own
4776988 half an hour before the tanks began firing the georgian peacekeepers disappeared from the base
4776989 they left their food uneaten and abandoned their kit then the shooting began
4776990 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
4776991 i dont think thats the way to defend the wheel lazos a great pitcher im sure the game plan was to throw right at his head it bounced up and hit him on the eye no game of baseball is worth that
4776992 most of us here would give anything to fly a sukhoi flanker
4776993 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4776994 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
4776995 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
4776996 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4776997 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
4776998 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
4776999 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors
4777000 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
4777001 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth are players that have to be protected
4777002 georgia hasnt distanced itself from nato as russia might have hoped and it also has not become closer to nato as saakashvili seems to have counted on when he gave the order to march toward tskinvali
4777003 russia is without a doubt vastly superior militarily and can bring the rebel territories back under its control but strategically it will not win
4777004 europe needs georgia and ukraine if it wants to remain independent of russias ever more monopolistic oil and gas deliveries while the west blocks iran and armenia is pledged to russia there are no pipeline routes for the rich resources of the caspian sea other than via georgia or via russia oil once again plays an important role in this war

4777096 the great ones jordan woods montana seem to not only win but win in the most dramatic fashion blending excellence with great theater add michael phelps to that list
4777097 the word that comes to mind epic what you did tonight was epic
4777098 im just happy to be in the same sentence as those athletes carl lewis mary lou retton jesse owens and mark spitz all those guys are great olympians and they will always be great olympians
4777099 the great ones jordan woods montana seem to not only win but win in the most dramatic fashion blending excellence with great theater add michael phelps to that list over the past week the 23 year old has won in every which way possible hes dominated setting four individual world records hes done it with his eyes closed overcoming a faulty pair of goggles to win the 200m butterfly in the sprint relay he had to rely on his teammate jason lezak to deliver and tonight with the stakes raised even higher michael phelps an eye blink from defeat in the 100m fly took one last half stroke reached for the wall and somehow reached another milestone he couldnt have won by a smaller margin and he couldnt have scripted this piece of olympic history any better
4777100 hes magical he is superman i dont know how he did it
4777101 i was just talking to janet 10 minutes before the finals started i asked her well what do you think she says its going down it really is going down even the great janet evans thinks that
4777102 not quite i knew shawn was going after me and we were going head to head basically this entire year and i knew it would come down to the last performance and that point i was just happy i had given all my effort i knew i had nothing to regret so you know i was really happy with how i did today but i knew shawn was still after me and i was just cheering her on because i knew we had a chance to go 1 2 and i hoped thats how it would come out
4777103 by then i didnt care about the score or anything i wanted to go out and hit the routine of my life and finish this olympic experience as best as i could i have no regrets i take nothing back i had a great time and i am so honored to be wearing the silver medal
4777104 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
4777105 results from tests on genetic material from alleged remains of one of the mythical half ape and half human creatures made public at a news conference on friday held after the claimed discovery swept the internet failed to prove its existence
4777106 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4777107 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4777108 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4777109 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4777110 world class entertainment centres museums resorts upscale residences and business centres are currently being built on the natural island
4777111 no belief is like modesty and patience no attainment is like humility no power is like forbearance and no support is more reliable than consultation
4777112 we demand the upa government that they bring in reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in all private educational institutes in the country
4777113 it is unfortunate that the supreme court has exempted higher educational private institutions from implementing quota
4777114 it is necessary for us to ensure that there is a common united struggle of all the oppressed sections in the society to bring in a change in the societal structure
4777115 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4777116 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4777117 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4777118 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4777119 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4777120 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4777121 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4777122 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4777123 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4777124 in 1985 there were 14 500 banks in the u s and now theres 7 200
4777125 for the past 23 years six of them went away each week the big universal banks might get hit but they stay in business and come out with a bigger share of the market than they had before
4777126 i have been going to the dentist here for 3 years ever since i moved to the city
4777127 you cant get any better than this for the price
4777128 im one of the locals i like to call this place my second kitchen i guess you can also call me one of the unofficial babysitters
4777129 oh its excellent we love it thats why we keep coming
4777130 when its over i want to say all my life i was a bride married to amazement
4777131 when its over i dont want to wonder if i have made of my life something particular and real
4777132 after you walk through this you can see this is going happen forever and ever and ever
4777133 that was something that we used to trudge around and mess around as children when we worked the fields
4777134 what were trying to do is to just show to the people that have taken to look at this
4777135 whats above the stream from those residents that live down on the 113 corridor highway 113
4777136 i was told about it 50 times from 50 different people
4777137 but until you see it you cant imagine what its like in here the speed of the water that must come down through here and the power pure raw power no comma and destruction
4777138 these floods are so severe that theyve essentially enlarged what we would call the flood prone area here
4777139 enlarged probably three or four maybe five times in some areas
4777140 these are all friends of mine that live down this creek
4777141 theyre all friends of my families and its just sad to see it and to know that it keeps happening to them i have no confidence anymore none
4777142 you just get so much bang for your buck if you do i 85
4777143 its such a lifeline for daily commuters and for statewide commerce
4777144 workers in the united states are putting in more hours than anyone else in the industrialized world
4777145 the ability to accept gods unconditional grace and ferocious love is all the fuel we need to obey him in return
4777146 you know you struggle with sga when you respond to news of more gay rights with joy and then think oh wait im against that
4777147 i feel like im on the verge of something big something that will be extremely significant not just for me but for others as well
4777148 theres close calls every time i go out but being aware of what i can do with my bike and being aware of the traffic thats around me i can mitigate those close calls and keep them just that close calls
4777149 a lot of people can get on a motorcycle buy a motorcycle and get on one and get it going down the road straight but theyre not prepared theyve never learned the proper technique for taking a corner and doing it properly
4777150 forty four percent of motorcycle fatalities happen in a curve with only a single motorcycle involved thats just simply the motorcyclists fault for not being able to negotiate the curve
4777151 all it takes to get on the road is to get a motorcycle license if people were to go out and hit the safety courses as part of the license processes i think there would be fewer accidents
4777152 ring the alarm about diverting so much of our food to our fuel supplies
4777153 the food wasnt too bad the shumai was good but when we got the bill they added items we never had to get a few extra bucks they did it to the table next to us too
4777154 i didnt shoot a gun im not responsible for this and im very sorry it happened
4777155 you can go this far but going past that is not my best for you
4777156 but isnt that exactly what must happen your love has to change to be only a friend love thats change in my book

4777164 we shouldnt dismiss either bid out of hand but these rumours come at a quiet time of year
4777165 i would say a potential vodafone takeover is more feasible and would create considerable restructuring of carphone ultimately it would probably lead to large scale closure of carphones uk retail outlets and rival operators would be forced to review their relationship with the group
4777166 a bid from best buy is feasible as it already has a small shareholding in carphone warehouse and could be interested in establishing a strong european presence but i would say the chances of either group launching a bid is only 50 50

4777181 it turned out to be a ddos attack dont know who or why but my guess is that it was a goof on the attackers part they just mistyped an ip address and mistakenly flooded my server instead of the georgian embassy or something anyway it gave me the opportunity to learn a bit more about firewalls and apache modules before the flood suddenly stopped monday morning a little mopping up and everything is back to the way it was

4777204 squatting in a way is an active participation of a non stop critique of the city itself as a capitalist structure
4777205 the act of squatting is also an act of criticism
4777206 whenever there are squatters its kind of understood that this is going to be a really big kind of criticism of everyday life within the ecological constructs
4777207 its moving into spaces that arent being used that have been abandoned and that are being wasted
4777208 it is too idealistic to think that you will never need money
4777209 theyll be out at the g8 meeting hear about a protest up in copenhagen and go there the next day
4777210 they really focus on global issues but only because they want to absolutely disassemble globalization and part of it is disassembling modernization so its just supporting localism
4777211 you have to be inclined to squat in a certain way or need it those are the factors
4777212 its something i do i think its part of activism and i have called it a lifestyle in the past but i call it an active critique of everyday life its always with me almost like a religion its something that i cant always get but its a dream for me

4777234 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4777235 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4777236 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4777237 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4777238 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4777239 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4777240 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4777241 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4777242 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4777243 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4777244 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4777245 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4777246 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture

4777249 this is a shameful day for the upa government three political parties belonging to the upa rjd samajwadi party and ram vilas paswans ljp have supported simi today it is clear that simi was behind the blasts this shows that the intentions of the government in fighting terror are suspect
4777250 for the past two years a series of blasts have been organised by terrorists in different parts of the country investigations in these cases have yielded very little due to weak laws we take this opportunity to appeal to the central government to bring about a pota or mcoca like law to fight terror

4777253 we have burnt our hands once with the independents and there is no chance of our party siding with the jmm we prefer to go for polls rather than experimenting with new formations

4777372 in the absence of a word that specifically means time passing confucius simply compares the passing stream with passing away what passes is both that which we call time and life itself in another passage from the analects shi is used explicitly with reference to the passage of time the days and months pass by shi but the harvest is not given to me xvii 1 in classical chinese days and months were also literally suns and moons and so they could also be said to pass by in a literal sense in later texts shi is used as a conventional euphemism for death or dying just as we speak of someone passing away shi is not however passing on which carries the implication of another world where one goes after death

4777456 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4777457 the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4777458 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example

4777893 we had been operating a damned murder inc in the caribbean

4777896 i dont think we ought to discuss suspicions because theres not any hard evidence that oswald was directed by a foreign government or that his sympathies for other governments could have spurred him on in the effort but he was quite a mysterious fellow and he did have connections that bore examination on the extent of the influence of those connections on him and i think history will deal with much more than we are able to now

4777931 already when we started with this album it felt obvious that this album would be called just backyard babies
4777932 this record feels most like backyard babies it was about time that we finally make an album that has all the ingredients that a classic rock album should have
4777933 we aimed to give our listeners and fans an early christmas present like no other we feel that we have made good albums before but that we havent been able to take the songs to the next level the last couple of albums have felt so close but not been able to make it to the finish line we managed to get a hold of our self confidence on this album already in our rehearsal studio the songs felt more clear and straight prouder and cockier more rock and more roll then as it turned out jacob hellner and backyard babies were like nitro and glycerine a very demanding producer with a very vengeful and keen band proved to give result

4777948 if mutu were an english player he wouldnt have paid any damages and he would only have been fired by his club this discrimination might affect the relationship between the european community and fifa

4778016 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4778017 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4778018 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4778019 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4778020 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4778021 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

4778025 and it opens up the whole topic of how little research there really is on the food safety impacts of what cattle are fed basically land grant universities that do most of the research on livestock issues are not very likely to criticize or even fully examine modern or more efficient techniques of raising cattle especially what they are fed

4778027 it will be a beautiful day when the masses look at the paper and truly realize they have lost their own country

4778031 american politics has often been an arena for angry minds
4778032 simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy that i have in mind
4778033 is the constitutional grant of authority to ban mere possession the obama overreach refuting a few of corsis smears by re writing history zogby poll majority want libertarian bob barr included in presidential debates the harley davidson vote the candidate with the fern sounding name
4778034 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4778035 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4778036 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4778037 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4778038 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4778039 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4778040 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4778041 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4778042 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4778043 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4778044 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4778045 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4778046 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4778049 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4778050 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4778051 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4778052 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4778053 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4778054 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4778055 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4778056 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4778057 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4778058 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4778059 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4778060 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4778061 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4778062 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4778063 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4778064 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4778065 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4778066 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4778067 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4778068 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4778069 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4778070 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4778071 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4778072 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4778073 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4778074 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4778075 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4778076 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4778077 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4778078 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4778079 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4778080 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4778081 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4778082 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4778083 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4778084 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4778085 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4778108 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore

4778111 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4778112 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4778113 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth

4778121 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4778122 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4778123 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4778124 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4778125 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4778128 the information was clearly unreliable and it was difficult to tell what was true or false

4778161 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4778344 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4778345 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4778346 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4778347 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4778348 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4778349 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4778350 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4778351 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4778352 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4778353 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4778354 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4778355 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4778356 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4778357 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4778358 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4778359 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4778360 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4778361 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4778368 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4778369 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4778370 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4778371 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4778372 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4778373 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4778374 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4778375 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4778376 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4778377 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

4778400 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4778401 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4778402 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4778403 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4778404 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4778405 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4778406 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4778407 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4778408 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4778409 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4778410 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4778411 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4778412 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4778413 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4778414 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4778415 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4778416 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4778417 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4778418 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4778419 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4778420 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4778421 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4778422 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4778423 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4778424 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4778425 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4778426 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4778427 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4778428 keep possession and pass it fastly enough so that spaces start to appear
4778429 hey we can do that too lets break up some businesses
4778430 investing in stocks that have low price to earnings ratios
4778431 a devotee therefore should execute his devotional services with full energy endurance and confidence he should perform his scheduled duties he should be pure in heart and he should serve in association with devotees all six of these items will lead the devotee to the path of success one should not be discouraged in the discharge of devotional service failures may not be detrimental they may be the pillars of success
4778432 we should always be enthusiastic to try for shooting the rhinoceros that way if we fail everybody will say never mind nobody can shoot a rhinoceros anyway and if we succeed then everyone will say just see what a wonderful thing they have done
4778433 so i dont think there is any cause of discouragement
4778434 do not be depressed all along my godbrothers gave me only depression repression compression but i continued strong in my duty so never mind there is some discouragement continue with your work in full enthusiastic krishna consciousness attitude of service
4778435 there are fundamental and compelling problems with the guru institution as it presently exists in iskcon
4778436 in all spiritual affairs ones first duty is to control his mind and senses unless one controls his mind and senses one cannot make any advancement in spiritual life everyone within this material world is engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance one must promote himself to the platform of goodness sattva guna by following the instructions of rupa gosvami in the first verse of upadesamrta and then everything concerning how to make further progress will be revealed
4778437 you know you should be really careful about what you say around mahakrama he reports everything back to satsvarupa maharaja you should know that
4778438 here we are supposed to be the reform party and we think we can save iskcon but we cannot even trust each other how will we be any better
4778439 the root of all problems now facing iskcon is that we the disciples of srila prabhupada have not yet established proper vaisnava relationships among ourselves while prabhupada was here with us we did not enjoy such relationships and our spiritual master plainly told us that our greatest fault was our tendency to quarrel with each other
4778440 a society of devotees in which proper vaisnava relations are not yet the norm is called a
4778441 he strays from the path of devotional service but his peers do not help him
4778442 spiritual immaturity often leads a kanistha adhikari to identify spiritual advancement with organizational advancement he thinks that attaining prestige power and the perquisites of office is evidence of spiritual advancement lacking the assets for real spiritual achievement he substitutes organizational elevation which he can attain through his cunning or political prowess he therefore competes intensely with others for high office and he comes to believe implicitly that one achieves a spiritually elevated state only by becoming victorious over others in this way material competition becomes institutionalized in kanistha adhikari societies
4778443 furthermore when a neophyte devotees has risen to the madhyama platform sadhana is absolutely necessary to maintain him in that position if he becomes slack in sadhana he rapidly reverts to the neophyte condition therefore the essential prerequisite for both creating and sustaining a madhyama society is intense common commitment to sadhana
4778444 one special advantage to this revolutionary project for the regeneration of iskcon is that it need not wait on the action of the gbc
4778445 any devotee who wants to institute reform must begin with himself the prerequisite for coming to the
4778446 therefore every devotee who wants to help in the reformation of iskcon must first carefully review his own spiritual condition and his personal devotional practice if he is careless in observing regulative principles and slack in
4778447 by this effort a devotee may quickly remove all his accommodations to sense gratification and undertake the deliberate dismantling of his false ego
4778448 having undertaken whatever personal reformatory measures are required the reforming devotee should then undertake the rectification of his relationships
4778449 he is conscious that many of his associates have made accommodations sometimes quite extensive to sense gratification
4778450 nor can the devotees work together effectively because they have no way of working out the inevitable differences that arise in any collective effort
4778451 under these conditions a great stockpile of resentment builds up in time and the atmosphere is filled with sullen undercurrents of hostility and mistrust relieved only by periodic outbursts of anger in this uncongenial climate devotional relations become more and more burdensome and materialistic people start to seem relatively nice the devotees find themselves living in deepening isolation from one another each enthroned in a well fortified ivory tower of false ego they learn to get along by avoiding each other these are some local conditions that arise in the milieu of fratricidal strife
4778452 the next step in the expansion of iskcon ending the fratricidal war
4778453 dandavats for your preliminary proposal for iskcon at last some hope
4778454 we need solid research to understand what should be the role and position of guru with that paper we can push on strongly for real change iskcon as prabhupada set it up has changed radically and the primary cause is the serious mistakes being made regarding the position of guru how can we establish the importance of sadhana in our movement when the majority of gurus give the worst example in this regard
4778455 bhaktisiddhanta sarasvati thakura at the time of his departure requested all his disciples to form a governing body and conduct missionary activities cooperatively he did not instruct a particular man to become the next
4778456 one who thinks himself lower than the grass who is more tolerant than a tree and who does not expect personal honor but is always prepared to give all respect to others can very easily always chant the holy name of the lord

4778566 i think its good because you have to compete with the chinese the normal chinese who are playing in china but now we also have to compete with chinese players even for austria all countries have three or four
4778567 you have so many good trainers possibilities to be a good player in china
4778568 its like in football if its a brazilian player theyre always good if its a chinese player hes always good
4778569 when i was playing for china i wanted a medal a gold medal representing the u s i want it too but i know the chances are slim
4778570 it still feels like coming back to the motherland a lot of the fans support us and we feel its like coming home it gives us strength
4778571 everyone who watches pingpong knows that were not young athletes
4778572 were ok but our abilities are much lower than the chinese team
4778573 i represented china in the past and after i retired i went to the states so they can understand that they have a lot of good players so it doesnt matter
4778574 i think its good because you have to compete with the chinese the normal chinese who are playing in china but now we also have to compete with chinese players even for norway finland austria all countries have three or four
4778575 you have so many good trainers possibilities to be a good player in china
4778576 its like brazil in football if its a brazilian player theyre always good if its a chinese player hes always good

4778579 drew didnt want to talk about it too much and i didnt want to ask him
4778580 i think hes feeling all right now tomorrow who knows
4778581 i didnt want to know what the options were with putting other people in the boat
4778582 its always in the back of your mind knowing you might break down
4778583 but as much as possible just let it all go not being fearful of it
4778584 the big fella just kept chugging along setting up the perfect rhythm
4778585 the standard of football at the olympics has never been higher
4778586 i think the number of yellow cards says everything about the game
4778587 the movement of athletes across the globe is more prevalent these days so i do think its going to be more commonplace
4778588 the question is how we value the country of our birth and whether its important that athletes compete for a country other than their birth country
4778589 hes really honored to do it and we feel pretty good about letting him be flagbearer for us
4778590 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
4778591 this rule is not against a nation or against china as some say
4778592 georgia brings for me the opportunity a very very big opportunity
4778593 brazil has many many teams in georgia its my chance its now
4778594 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
4778595 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4778596 obviously he will miss the start of the 2008 09 season but the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season
4778597 we have water issues golf courses and farmers are seen as big users right now its more politically popular to get golf courses to cut their usage first once thats done well go after the farmers
4778598 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4778599 would you offer him a job in an obama administration

4778601 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4778602 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

4778607 having the time to train for three sessions a day and find someone outside the sport would be almost impossible
4778608 everyone is traveling around the world together and everyones together all the time its easy it just goes that way
4778609 weve learned a lot more about ourselves through this sport
4778610 we feel very lucky to be learning lifes lessons through the language of the triathlon it takes a lot of dedication and its a lot better to have someone who understands to share it with
4778611 you have to have someone who is like minded and knows the sacrifices involved in it
4778612 i think having somebody who understands what youre trying to do really helps out
4778613 the movement of athletes across the globe is more prevalent these days so i do think its going to be more commonplace
4778614 the question is how we value the country of our birth and whether its important that athletes compete for a country other than their birth country
4778615 hes really honored to do it and we feel pretty good about letting him be flagbearer for us
4778616 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
4778617 this rule is not against a nation or against china as some say
4778618 georgia brings for me the opportunity a very very big opportunity
4778619 has many many teams in georgia its my chance its now
4778620 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4778621 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4778627 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4778628 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4778629 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4778630 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4778631 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4778632 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4778633 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4778634 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4778635 who are open to doing something on the production side
4778636 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4778637 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4778638 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4778639 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4778640 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4778641 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4778642 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4778643 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4778644 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4778646 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4778647 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4778648 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4778649 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4778650 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4778651 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4778652 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4778653 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4778654 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4778655 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4778656 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4778657 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4778658 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4778659 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4778660 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4778661 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4778662 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4778663 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4778664 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4778665 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4778666 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4778667 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4778668 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4778669 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4778670 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4778671 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4778672 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4778673 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4778674 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4778675 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4778690 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4778691 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4778692 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4778693 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4778694 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4778695 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4778696 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4778697 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4778698 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4778699 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4778700 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4778701 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4778702 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4778703 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4778704 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4778705 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4778706 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4778707 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4778708 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4778709 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4778710 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4778711 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4778727 its my escape from myself my salvation and despair happiness and boundless longing for the unhappened its like expectation as well
4778728 there are two kinds of stones as everyone knows one of which rolls
4778729 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4778730 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4778731 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4778732 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4778733 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4778734 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4778735 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4778736 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4778737 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4778738 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4778739 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4778740 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4778741 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4778742 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4778743 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4778744 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4778745 we applaud our students for their commitment to higher education and our faculty practitioners for their dedication to helping todays working professionals advance or change their careers
4778746 why do you think you take such risks irene certainly you are aware of the things you do you make conscious choices you even seem to take pleasure in them
4778747 tell me how things are going with you and niles
4778748 niles tries so very hard i cant fault him one bit im the obstacle here ive just thought there should be more for a long time now
4778749 i dont know maybe i never would be thats a frightening thought isnt it
4778750 it could be if at some point you dont begin to realize that no one gets everything they want in life thats not the way life works you are a very fortunate woman
4778751 i dont feel so fortunate i dont feel cherished or desired or appreciated or even needed ive done what i was supposed to do emily ive been the model wife and the model mother now i want the things i want i deserve them
4778752 but no one should overlook or discard the treasures that have been bestowed
4778753 you mean the grass always seems greener well maybe it is
4778754 at any cost i want a man to make me laugh to arouse me with a glance to set me on fire with a touch i want a man to sweep me off my feet is that so wrong
4778755 not at all but is it realistic given the choice you made in marriage partners
4778756 you might say that i got the surprise of my life last tuesday afternoon
4778757 mmmmm surprises can certainly add a great measure of pleasure to an otherwise ordinary day
4778758 christ i didnt know what to do i just left the house again and drove around for a long while
4778759 well they are of the age of consent but you would have been well within your rights to confront them on the occasion you speak of did you confront them
4778760 no i i couldnt have it just wasnt something i had ever expected to happen not in our home and certainly not with a black man who is so much older
4778761 look were not prejudice emily and we didnt raise kelsey to be either i felt out of place in my own home and im guessing that niles would have felt as i did had he been the one to discover them
4778762 of course it was blatant disregard and it should have been addressed why do you think it is that you didnt
4778763 walking in on something like that it just takes your breath away whatever i would have said would not have come out the way it should have
4778764 i understand you could still do it in a one on one conversation with kelsey i think that you should consider it to reaffirm your limits and make your expectations known
4778765 what if i told you that none of this happened last week that it happened last summer
4778766 well thats not so very long how did it begin between you
4778767 and im going to give you a taste of what you want
4778768 he knew he could have me anytime he wanted and he knew it crazy huh
4778769 crazy is simply another point of view but you do know the magnitude of the risk youre taking the longer this goes on the harder it will get to stop it you do want to stop it dont you
4778770 i know the correct answer here i know what you expect me to say the truth is though that i dont know that i want to stop i need what jackson offers me

4778822 as a painter i consider egg cartons as two and a half dimensional objects which offer me remarkable possibilities for imagery the waves of the egg cartons limit the viewers perception they also make him aware of his positioning towards the image the intentional limitation in subjective perception gives room for imagination and recall the process of occlusion by a fusion of direct and indirect perception conventional imagery is overtaken at first sight this leads to a physical and mental incompleteness that forces an integration which can only take place within the inner experience apart from time and space

4778844 sciences not even the hardest ones are not purely objective nor arts are purely subjective
4778845 to fool others you need to fool yourself first thus becoming a fool
4778846 a failure is not that awful if you learn something from it
4778847 the first step to understand people is to accept them as they are
4778848 he believes that our universe was created by a higher civilization
4778849 even when moores law has increased the speed of computers amazingly our ability to program them hasnt i
4778850 more computing power does not necessarily mean better predictive abilities to the point of being able to predict or simulate a planet let alone the universe
4778851 moreover if you had a simulation of the universe it would need to be inside our universe so it would need to be also simulating itself russells paradox
4778852 if you create a new universe wouldnt it be inside ours
4778853 how do you keep it from interacting with our universe
4778854 how can you prevent heat death from invading the new universe
4778855 well if we decide to change the meaning of universe all that there is around us
4778856 1 everything in existence ever anywhere 2 the region we inhabit plus everything that has interacted or ever will interact with this region 3 this region plus everything that has interacted with it by now or will at least do so in the next few billion years 4 any gigantic system of causally interacting things that is wholly or very largely isolated from others 5 any system that might well have become gigantic etc even if it in fact recollapsed while still very small 6 or nowadays the word cosmos might be used to refer to everything in existence while universe was used in a way permitting talk of several universes inside the cosmos
4778857 i do not know enough about programing languages to see a pattern in this evolution
4778858 that sounds to me not very well founded who says that on what ground
4778859 in my view it could in principle be possible to simulate an entire universe even without being able to predict it in a deterministic way
4778860 nowadays the word cosmos might be used to refer to everything in existence while universe was used in a way permitting talk of several universes inside the cosmos

4778987 at its core poker is math math cant be wrong it is truth itself to deny math is to deny your nose
4778988 total all the dollars youve ever bet playing poker the large majority of those dollars should have been bet from late position only a small percentage of your total handle should have been bet from up front
4778989 fold more when the pot is small compared to the bet size than when its big
4778990 play big pots with big hands and small pots with small hands

4778992 i remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base
4778993 due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find
4778994 that is what she has said many many times and on one occasion she misspoke
4778995 everyone else was told to sit on their bulletproof vests

4778997 joins a growing list of instances in which senator clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking
4778998 this is something that the obama campaign wants to push cause they have nothing positive to say about their candidate
4778999 oh the other phone place offers me this and that
4779000 no thanks il leave it im off to the other place
4779001 in the course of his two terms in office bill clinton met with corresponded with and took pictures with literally tens of thousands of people
4779002 it would be very difficult for her or the clinton campaign publicly to pair electability with reverend wright because its so inflammatory
4779003 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
4779004 the reverend wright attacks wouldnt even look like swift boating its just putting his comments out there
4779005 i think the clinton campaign has to show leadership and sensitivity here this cannot become part of the mix with the drug stuff and the south carolina stuff

4779052 elastra has made faster and more manageable what is normally a complex process of deploying and managing clustered scalable relational databases and theyve allowed us to derive significantly more business benefit from cloud computing systems elastra has enabled our team to focus on our core business goals and application innovation
4779053 elastra gives our company the scalability required to accommodate bursts in our computing demand without having to waste money and over provision our data center resources additionally elastras meter based pricing allows us to pay only for what we use freeing our capital for other company differentiating investments and projects as elastra continues to develop its solution to include additional industry standard application components we plan to expand our use of their cutting edge technology to provide us with a strong competitive edge
4779054 the big impetus for building elastra cloud server was the realization that if hardware has really become something software can manipulate our customers can now have applications that they design be deployed scaled and managed by software processes that connect to compute clouds which provide a pool of virtual hardware resources we wanted to pick up where utility computing left off to go beyond the vm and toward virtualizing complex applications that span many machines and networks
4779055 virtualized hardware alone is not enough for companies to realize the true value of the cloud a managed automated way to architect deploy scale and maintain software which supports applications in virtualized environments is needed along with infrastructure software that enables organizations to actually use the cloud to its fullest potential this software should follow the same utility based service model that the underlying virtualized hardware ascribes to
4779056 with these enhancements cloud computing is set to fundamentally improve how businesses of all sizes build and deploy applications and consume infrastructure both software and hardware
4779057 if you want to do what you want to do today then i suggest that you do what you know you should
4779058 for over two years amazon web services has provided infrastructure services that help companies of all sizes from small startups to larger enterprises realize the cost time and scaling efficiencies of cloud computing we believe that cloud computing will continue to grow into a large industry with companies providing a range of different services
4779059 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
4779060 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts
4779061 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
4779062 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand
4779063 stuff it nice part we are too grouchy to be interested in your niceyness go be reassuring somewhere else we want no pleasantry here
4779064 maybe you can get a side of nanny with your vicodin
4779065 het is al jaren geleden dat ik nog op vakantie ben geweest
4779066 elastras products help our company configure deploy and manage the infrastructure we need so that we can concentrate on our product paygo saas knowing that we can launch servers and clusters with ease and scale our it operations at any time has allowed our company to focus on what we do best and thats building solutions for independent retailers
4779067 we are pleased to see companies like elastra further enable enterprise class applications to be architected deployed scaled and managed in our leading web scale computing platform
4779068 elastra has gained significant traction with customers from many walks of life web 2 0 companies isvs and enterprise it overall we have had great response to our first product set and component offering the on demand cloud server and rdbms component and our approach to cloud computing customers do want turn key scalable on demand systems customers do understand that software that makes cloud computing useful is not just a bunch of scripts that launch machines but is instead a tapestry of software components that bring the benefits of virtualization to their entire application stack

4779299 our deepest calling is to grow into our own authentic self hood whether or not it confirms to some image of who we ought to be as we do so we will not only find the joy that every human being seeks we will also find our path of authentic service int he world true vocation joins self and service as frederick buechner asserts when he defines vocation as the place where your deep gladness meets the worlds deep need buechners definition starts with the self and moves toward the needs of the world it begins wisely where vocation begins not in what the wold needs which is everything but in the nature of the human self in what brings the self joy the deep joy of knowing that we are here on earth to be the gifts that god created

4779314 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4779315 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4779316 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4779317 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4779318 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4779319 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4779331 i know theyve had some talks and i know its moving along whatever that means it sounds positive to me though
4779332 i want what every parent wants for their children i want a home of our own so that when i die they can remain together a safe and reliable car and all their needs met i also want them to remain happy and healthy

4779342 the only time a true friendship ends is when one stops fighting to keep it together
4779343 but what if i dont want to fight with you because i just want things to remain the same
4779344 a fight doesnt have to consist of yelling just arguing the point of what that person matters to you can make someone realize how important of a role they play in your life
4779345 solitude brought out the worst in me it gave me time to brood over the nature of things i wondered how some people could be such a necessary part of ones life one day and simply vanish the next isnt it supposed to last but im not unhappy i dont think any of us are we got what we needed out of it its kind of like going on a vacation you plan everything out but one day you make a wrong turn or take a detour and you end up in some crazy place you can never find on the map doing something you never thought youd do maybe you feel a little lost while its happening but later you realize it was the best part of the whole trip
4779346 manipulating real facts giving unsubstantiated hearsay credibility and turning all this into negatives that suit your politics is ugly it serves only to characterize the perpetrators as mindless desperate and bigoted and anyone who can think through a proper logical argument should be able to see it all for what it is malicious and irresponsible defamation of character in the guise of reportage

4779348 without the money to go to the international school that most expatriate children attended i went to local indonesian schools and ran the streets with the children of farmers servants tailors and clerks
4779349 i came here to barack obamas elementary school in jakarta looking for what some are calling an islamic madrasah like the ones that teach hate and violence in pakistan and afghanistan ive been to those madrasahs in pakistan and this school is nothing like that
4779350 attacks on obamas elementary school are laughable given the moderate form of islam practiced in indonesia especially in those days the effort to slime barack obama has begun in the slimiest possible way
4779351 obamas stepfather was not a muslim extremist among other things he worked for shell oil obama attended public school for two years in indonesia in addition to the two years he spent in catholic schools although as obamas staff points out indonesia is a muslim country so the public schools undoubtedly reflect the dominant religious culture
4779352 theres evidence he got in trouble in koranic studies for making faces
4779353 you have already paid through september 1st so any extra time you need after that will be prorated 13 day
4779354 eh well whatever this has been planned for a couple days
4779355 when i first competed in worlds i did not know what the british parliamentary format was like i have never encountered such a phenomenon before
4779356 its not discussed in our editorials not written about in our student papers there really wasnt anyone or much of anyone to debate with
4779357 its a shame because in many prominent universities abroad debate is the ultimate academic activity
4779358 you have to prove yourself all the time and more often than not youll lose its a high pressure highly competitive environment
4779359 students are apprehensive to debate because they dont have the linguistic abilities to be able to convey ideas
4779360 people dont like watching debates in general because they think its just for smart alecks and pilosopos who are good at using big words without even believing what they say
4779361 a lot of people think we are serious that were bookish in reality we do tend to talk about things that are more serious than a lot of more mainstream topics but id like to think that we are still a very healthy well rounded group of people who also have fun and are exposed to various things
4779362 a lot of the debate topics revolve around politics economics social issues so even if there are topics like pop culture or even sports and local events the perception of non debaters is that everything in debate is abstract
4779363 one can learn the skills involved in debate so the important thing is that youre really interested in discussing the issues
4779364 you have to work doubly hard to make an impact in one worlds tournament then youll be gone for three years and all your efforts would go to waste
4779365 its difficult to compare because each university and country has a distinct style but philippine debating can definitely match up with everyone elses
4779366 weve hosted the worlds weve consistently done well at worlds so someone who goes to worlds
4779367 i expect ateneo to win over a yale or a princeton or a harvard
4779368 they speak really well fluently they dont have problems grasping for words
4779369 but in terms of content we can be at par with them its really a matter of delivery and engagement
4779370 the issues we discuss and the ways we tackle them tend to differ from the way they do
4779371 the biases dont even need to be explicit like the things that judges from europe would look for would be different from judges from asia would look for sadly some judges do have explicit racial biases you can complain but you cant lobby to overturn the decision in your favor
4779372 you can feel it while youre inside the room because its as if theyre whispering what are they doing here
4779373 we dont change the way we think but we try to adapt by for example trying to give examples familiar to the adjudicators in other words by being able to fit their description of a good debater
4779374 the majority of the adjudicators are fair but sometimes if you face biased adjudicators its simply bad luck
4779375 i really think that the community would grow and that smaller institutions would become more established
4779376 the differences in skill between manila and non manila based teams is getting smaller and smaller and manila institutions would have to contend with many more provincial teams
4779377 even if we dont win the world championships overnight hopefully we position ourselves well because thats almost half of the battle being able to position yourself as one of the top tier schools
4779378 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
4779379 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
4779380 1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus 2 and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him 3 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife 4 for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her 5 and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet 6 but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod 7 whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask 8 and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger 9 and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her 11 and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother 12 and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus
4779381 1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus 2 and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him 3 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife 4 for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her 5 and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet 6 but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod 7 whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask 8 and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger 9 and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her 11 and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother 12 and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus
4779382 1 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
4779383 1 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth 2 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband 3 so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man
4779384 21 and if a man shall take his brothers wife it is an unclean thing he hath uncovered his brothers nakedness they shall be childless
4779385 4 for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her
4779386 6 but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod
4779387 some kind of rapid motion a shameful exhibition of lewd dancing
4779388 because of its physical appeal dance lends itself to erotic purposes and has been practiced to these ends by both sexes
4779389 unbridled lust wanton acts or manners including filthy words indecent bodily movements unchaste handling of males and females
4779390 aidos would always restrain a good man from an unworthy act
4779391 29 and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him 30 and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me 31 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father 32 and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah 33 their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord
4779392 1 when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry 2 and came even before the kings gate for none might enter into the kings gate clothed with sackcloth 3 and in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes 4 so esthers maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it not 5 then called esther for hatach one of the kings chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was 6 so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the kings gate 7 and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the jews to destroy them 8 also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people 9 and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai 10 again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai 11 all the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days 13 then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews 14 for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this 16 go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish 17 so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him
4779393 1 now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house 2 and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre 3 then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom 4 and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him 5 then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared 6 and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed 7 then answered esther and said my petition and my request is 8 if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said 9 then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai 10 nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife 11 and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king 12 haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king 13 yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the kings gate 14 then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made
4779394 1 on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king 2 and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the kings chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus 3 and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this then said the kings servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him 4 and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into the outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him 5 and the kings servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court and the king said let him come in 6 so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself 7 and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour 8 let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head 9 and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour 10 then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken 11 then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour 12 and mordecai came again to the kings gate but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered 13 and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him 14 and while they were yet talking with him came the kings chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared
4779395 29 say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i will render to the man according to his work
4779396 17 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men 18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord
4779397 9 not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing
4779398 1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus 2 and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
4779399 5 and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet
4779400 20 for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly
4779401 6 but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod 7 whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask 8 and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger
4779402 8 but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself
4779403 10 for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ
4779404 quando tu guarderai il cielo la notte visto che io abiter in una di esse visto ke rider in una di esse allora sar per te come se tutte le stelle ridessero tu avrai tu solo delle stelle che sanno ridere
4779405 e quando ti sarai consolato sarai contento di avemi conosciuto
4779406 im not going back to the fifties i never left
4779407 we always tried to make games that anyone could pick up and play they may over time reveal a lot of structural and mechanical complexity
4779408 but the first mission of more or less any rockstar game is very easy and engaging for a reason because new people playing the game have to be gently led into the world of 3d action games or open world racing games or whatever this is the way we try to cater for a mass market
4779409 good games will usually sell and be popular bad games will struggle of any type or genre or style
4779410 you can take the mask off the lone ranger and put it on someone else but it aint the lone ranger
4779411 lavrov ha declarado que rusia pondr en pr ctica el acuerdo fielmente
4779412 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4779413 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement
4779414 the president informed participants of the russian national security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan to end hostilities
4779415 that bridge being gone effectively results in the country losing east west railway communications for how long i do not know
4779416 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4779417 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4779418 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4779419 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4779420 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4779421 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4779422 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4779423 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4779424 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4779425 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4779426 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4779427 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4779428 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4779429 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4779430 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4779431 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4779432 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4779433 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4779434 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4779435 con las mismas personas y las mismas pol ticas los gobiernos socialistas han llevado a la crisis a nuestro pa s en la primera mitad de los a os 90 y ahora de nuevo bajo el mandato de zapatero
4779436 da prioridad a unas comunidades aut nomas frente a otras
4779437 plantearemos el debate una a una para que el gobierno diga por qu no las acepta pero desde luego la oposici n est cumpliendo con su obligaci n ha hecho propuestas y adem s le ha ofrecido colaboraci n en este asunto
4779438 con las mismas personas y las mismas pol ticas los gobiernos socialistas han llevado a la crisis a nuestro pa s en la primera mitad de los a os 90 y ahora de nuevo bajo el mandato de zapatero
4779439 a nadie se le ocurre poner bombas por estar en contra de un proyecto
4779440 now i can harness my pain and only use it in dire circumstances i hate violence now its a last resort id rather punch a wall than someone else because i dont want to do time
4779441 id recommend tomorrows people to anyone although they sometimes lay it on a bit thick if you know what i mean
4779442 in june 2007 my 19 year old nephew was working in the prestigious presidential guard when fighting broke out between the fatah and hamas factions last summer he was pinned against a wall by hamas gunmen thinking he was going to be assassinated he began to murmur there is no god but allah and mohammed is his prophet hamas accused him of not being a true muslim and stripped him of his uniform and his job he spent ten days at home weeping to himself utterly defeated there are few things for fatah supporters to do here especially for angry young men so he joined the al aqsa martyrs brigade a fatah affiliated militant group the israelis shot him dead in beit hanoun earlier this year you ask me what you should focus on for your gaza project we cant even focus ourselves there are so many issues here so many problems where does one start i dont know what else to tell you
4779443 i watched it live with my family it was difficult my mum was a little bit rattled my brother and i just talked about it it was a little bit upsetting
4779444 but there is no point dwelling on it you just have to move on
4779445 people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4779446 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4779447 if they are sitting down and talking about one aspect of their lives they might as well work out lifestyle clauses as well
4779448 it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4779449 its amazing how many people come in and say i dont know how i am going to broach that with my partner but you have got to talk about wills and death and thats not very nice either
4779450 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4779451 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4779452 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4779453 it is appalling that people would recklessly endanger childrens lives in this way
4779454 they are a reminder to motorists who think they can ignore the rules of the road and recklessly endanger childrens lives that they will get caught
4779455 police will continue to enforce school speed zones until the message gets through to all road users that this kind of irresponsible behaviour will not be tolerated
4779456 speed limits in school zones are there for a very simple reason to protect our children
4779457 we dont want to see a senseless tragedy occur outside one of our schools so i urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit
4779458 until a review of additional hours allocation by the parties to this agreement is completed and agreed
4779459 from our point of view there should be full time teacher aides in prep
4779460 im going for a shower and to think about this
4779461 wrestling physical conditioning encyclopedia published by the athletic press pasadena ca in 1974
4779462 there is no shortcut to strength development as there is none for the development of skill agility or endurance in an athlete no amount of fancy gimmicks or equipment or adoption of alleged time saving fads will substitute for a long term program of hard work that is required to develop the quality of strength needed by an athlete for optimum performance in his specialty greater progress in track and field during the past 15 years has been the result of harder work by the athletes not by resorting to shortcuts and less work
4779463 thats great for us theyre going to have to come to us for workers
4779464 new employees come to agriprocessors mainly through word of mouth
4779465 as a result many of agriprocessors new employees found their jobs through family members already working for the company
4779466 theyre just trying to reconstruct the migrant labor supply that was blown to pieces by the raid
4779467 i didnt want to uproot someone and them be treated poorly
4779468 they were people that came up here looking for a handout
4779469 there are not that many opportunities for work here and the opportunities there are are low paying
4779470 i dont think theyll be able to go back to undocumented workers because theyre being scrutinized so much
4779471 i knew sooner or later it was going to catch up with them

4779475 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4779476 people are more savvy these days perhaps they have less expectation that their relationship is going to last forever
4779477 the finance part is the binding part but many people think they might as well work out lifestyle clauses
4779478 it wouldnt surprise me if fidelity or weight was a clause it depends on the personalities involved and the relative positions of those involved
4779479 we just thought it makes good sense that in the event of a separation not that we think its going to happen that what we bought into the relationship is protected
4779480 this passion for aviation aerospace has been with me as long as i can remember its something ive been focused on for a very long time

4779487 when steve set off the epirb emergency beacon i realised it was critical i thought what if we dont get out i want to live my life im too young to die ms landon said
4779488 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just get buried and completely suffocate us so one of us had to get out and dig it mr cole said
4779489 it was just impossible to get a helicopter into the area where the beacon had been activated constable greg sutherland said
4779490 it was terrible we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night mr cole said
4779491 you could see the chopper but it was searching not in the right area and when it flew away we lost heart i felt myself go down and i thought is this it
4779492 aspirational is used by people outside western sydney with the same kind of moral undertone that was used with westies without an understanding of why people live the way they do
4779493 you can have a big house in the eastern suburbs and youre not greedy but if you have a mcmansion and a 4wd in western sydney youve become greedy
4779494 theres a different morality so the big house car and big plasma screen become items of ridicule
4779495 people think those living in the western suburbs are ferals who just breed and take money from the government

4779505 the introduction of the internet means everything needs to be more updateable on the retail sense the range has to come out quicker and people are really impatient these days they dont stick around so much hartmann said
4779506 there is also the easy ability for us to be financed these days in our grandparents day they saved then purchased now we purchase and pay later
4779507 young women have more and more disposable incomes and so they are very skilfully targeted by the marketers and the designers to entice them into buying must have products from iphones to shoes zinn said
4779508 for me it is an addiction jesrocca posted on vogue
4779509 it is similar to other addictions where those with shopping addictions feel a high after purchasing followed by feelings of shame and guilt carmon said
4779510 culturally we find it a very pleasurable experience buying and accumulating stuff and we aint going to give up on our addiction to that experience easily she said

4779577 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4779578 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4779579 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4779580 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4779581 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4779582 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4779583 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4779584 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4779585 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4779586 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4779587 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4779588 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4779589 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4779590 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4779591 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4779592 topless modeling contest that among other things involves a section with a banana
4779593 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4779594 because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation
4779595 i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency
4779596 sen mccain has been very honest about his life and about not only who he was but i think very refreshingly who he is
4779597 and the one thing i find about sen mccain is that he is a man of honor
4779598 they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss
4779599 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4779600 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4779601 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4779602 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4779603 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4779604 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4779605 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4779606 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4779607 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4779608 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4779609 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4779610 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4779611 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4779614 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4779615 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4779616 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4779617 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4779618 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4779619 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4779620 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4779621 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4779622 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4779623 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4779624 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4779625 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4779626 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4779627 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4779628 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4779629 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4779630 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4779631 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4779632 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4779633 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4779634 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4779635 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4779636 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4779637 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4779638 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4779639 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4779640 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4779641 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4779642 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4779653 makes for depressing reading on the one hand the americans and israelis claim that they want to help palestinians the reality as we know is all too different what a calamity of justice and decency has confronted this young palestinian seeking to come to the us

4779691 they loved it out there it was good just to get away from things
4779692 youre 160km away from anywhere so it was good to have space and come to terms with everything
4779693 the key message wed like to get across is that if you try and claim the grant ineligibly you will be caught
4779694 we understand that circumstances change if youve claimed the grant and you believe you shouldnt have its best to contact the state revenue office sooner rather than later
4779695 caused by blood clotting caused by factors related to taking the oral contraceptive pill

4779704 when we saw that chopper there was a lot of tears and screaming
4779705 i have always been aware of how dangerous it can be and how vulnerable you can be out there because i think at times im a bit invincible
4779706 but no i would never give up going out climbing or walking
4779707 i was so shocked when i heard from him he just said im safe now im just calling you to say im safe
4779708 we could see the chopper but you cant make contact or get help
4779709 then it goes away and you know it will be night time soon and were stuck here for another night

4779713 the reality is that all cities that have water shortages have to look at it
4779714 reusing treated water for drinking purposes is definitely part of australias water future
4779715 we are already the driest continent and climate change is making that worse so its very important that australia is one of the first countries to adopt recycled water and recycled water for drinking
4779716 they should be investigating the possibility of using that water to replenish our reservoirs and eventually have it coming out of our taps

4779723 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4779724 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4779725 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4779743 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4779744 im really proud of it and scott is really proud of it
4779745 the australians had a great push through the middle we pushed back a little bit but congratulations to them they definitely deserved that were very happy with a silver medal today
4779746 the club want to reinforce the central defensive department but they only want a good defender and not a second rate player unfortunately however the best players usually arent allowed to leave by their clubs
4779747 rafael marquez has the right characteristics and experience but i dont think barcelona will sell him
4779748 we are not in an emergency but the match against juve is just a friendly still we want to do well because the trophy is named after our presidents father and considering our performances in the recent friendlies we want do make a good impression against a team which is already in shape
4779749 clearly we all have faith that things will turn out very well but its true that we have to take it step by step
4779750 what we have to do is obtain a lot of points at the start and get us safe from relegation as soon as possible
4779751 after that betis more calm than in other years are ready to do big things we are a team with a lot of quality and if things go well we can show this and be well placed in the top half of the table at the end of the season
4779752 i am fighting all the time to improve my performances at betis they trust in me and i have a responsibility to return this confidence with my work on the pitch
4779753 the fans have always shown me their affection and they can be relaxed because i am going to give it everything for this club if all goes well we are going to have a very positive year at betis
4779754 it was our first game in the premier league we played well but we suffered a lot it was very important to win that game
4779755 west bromwich played very well in the second half they played the long ball and that was not easy for us but you know the mentality of the players is very good we wanted to win
4779756 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4779757 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4779758 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way

4779760 i see india winning 10 medals at the next olympic meet
4779761 indian coaches are equally capable but the problem is we dont train them in technical and other stuff
4779762 cricket is huge in this country i love cricket and though cricket is the most popular game that will not help recognise india as a sporting power
4779763 though there is no such thing at the moment i will like to certainly contribute in some way and in course of time i will think about it
4779764 i always keep myself detached from winning i just try to keep my cool and focus on my performance rather than winning
4779765 i guess they won their super bowl rings in training camp because they didnt win it last year

4779769 sociologists have emphasised that all humans are born naked and helpless and depend on others for their survival for years
4779770 a second widespread way of doubting the ideal of choice is to point out that when it comes to it almost nobody ill or healthy is any good at it it is difficult for all of us to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of one uncertain future against another
4779771 care is not a limited product but an ongoing process
4779772 consumers can help each other with their choices and they may buy as much kindness and attention as they can afford however and this is my point in one way or another a market requires that the product that changes hands in a transaction be clearly defined it must have a beginning and an end in the logic of care by contrast care is an interactive open ended process that may be shaped and reshaped depending on its results this difference is irreducible it implies that a care process may improve even though less product is being supplied
4779773 diseased bodies are unpredictable it follows form this unpredictability that care is not a well delineated product but an open ended process try adjust try again in dealing with a disease that is chronic the care process is chronic too it only ends the day you die
4779774 do not just pay attention to what technologies are supposed to do but also to what they happen to do even if this is unexpected this means that good professionals need to ask patients about their experiences and attend carefully to what they are told even if there is nothing about it in the clinical trial literature there wont be the unexpected is not included in the design of trials the parameters to be measured are laid out in the first stage of a clinical epidemiology research project if doctors and nurses want to learn about the unexpected effects of interventions they should treat every single intervention as yet another experiment they should again and again be attentive to whatever it is that emerges
4779775 the scientific tradition that is currently most prominent in health care that of clinical epidemiology has not been designed to deal with the unexpected effects of interventions tracing these requires that one be open to surprises since unforeseen events cannot be foreseen and unidentified variables cannot be counted other research methods are needed to learn more about them promising among these are the clinical interview and the case report in good clinical interviews patients are granted time and space to talk about what they find striking difficult or important the diverse and surprising experiences are carefully attended to case reports in their turn are stories about remarkable events they make these events transportable so that others may learn from them
4779776 the ideal of patient choice presupposes professionals who limit themselves to presenting facts and using instruments
4779777 i want to talk of doctoring within the logic of care engaging in care is a matter of doctoring doctoring again depends on being knowledgeable accurate and skilful but added to that it also involves being attentive inventive persistent and forgiving
4779778 good communication is a crucial precondition for good care it also is care in and of itself it improves peoples daily lives
4779779 good conversations in a consulting room do not take the shape of a confrontation between arguments but are marked by an exchange of experiences knowledge suggestions words of comfort
4779780 let us doctor and thus in careful ways experiment with our own lives and let us tell each other stories case histories public life deserves to be infused with rich stories about personal events
4779781 clinical epidemiology has developed clinical trials as research tools to inquire into the effectiveness and effectivity of treatments
4779782 some diseases can never be cured some problems keep on shifting even if good care strives after good results the quality of care cannot be deduced from its results instead what characterises good care is a calm persistent but forgiving effort to improve the situation of a patient or to keep this from deteriorating
4779783 the logic of care is not preoccupied with our will and with what we may opt for but concentrates on what we do

4779788 leider bin ich zu beginn des qualifyings von zwei langsameren fahrzeugen aufgehalten worden
4779789 das hat mich sechs sieben zehntel gekostet aber ich freue mich auf morgen wir haben ein sehr gutes auto f r das rennen vom vierten startplatz k nnen wir es wieder auf das podium schaffen
4779790 es war schade dass alex ein paar langsamere autos vor die nase gefahren sind wenn man aus der box kommt muss man einfach in den r ckspiegel schauen trotzdem sind wir zufrieden wir stehen in der zweiten reihe und werden angreifen
4779791 wir wollten hier n her an unseren teamkollegen sein oder ihnen vielleicht sogar voraus das haben wir geschafft
4779792 ich habe im qualifying sieben zehntelsekunden in der letzten kurve hinter einem porsche verloren das hat uns den dritten startplatz gekostet
4779793 das gr ere problem ist aber dass an unserem auto seit zwei tagen die vorderr der beim bremsen blockieren dieses problem m ssen wir bis zum rennen unbedingt l sen
4779794 nach unseren guten erinnerungen an le mans ist das trainingsergebnis nat rlich etwas entt uschend wir haben hier schwierigkeiten eine gute balance zu finden
4779795 das auto schluckt die bodenwellen nicht gut genug es gibt noch viel zu tun
4779796 dass die beiden peugeot vorne sind ist keine berraschung der abstand auch nicht
4779797 dass auch noch der aston martin lola vor uns steht ist etwas unsch n
4779798 aber unsere beiden autos sind mit frischen reifen im verkehr h ngen geblieben als sie endlich eine freie runde hatten waren die reifen schon nicht mehr optimal

4779803 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4779804 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4779805 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4779806 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4779807 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4779814 grant was always a ladies man and having two women i pick up in a bar throwing some of his ashes to the wind would be the kindest tribute i could give him
4779815 obviously youre poor if you think that place is the be all and end all of restaurants
4779816 when i die can you make sure no one puts me in a zip lock bag
4779817 that late huh where did you go what did you girls do
4779818 we tried one bar but it was closed cause they went fishing then we went to the hotel i love for cocktails then somehow we found chester there and he had a dead friend named grant in a zip lock bag and he asked us to take a pinch of grant and throw him off the railing of the patio then we were to another bar and got picked up by a fireman who wants to be a filmmaker then we went and got super drunk
4779819 he had a dead friend in a zip lock bag how fucking drunk were you that you can even joke about that
4779820 i was drunk i am serious i think grant is still under my nails ive never touched anyones ashes before i am kinda grossed out
4779821 are you fucking serious cause no way is this funny unless its true then it is fucking sick and kinda funny i have to go youre twisted

4779823 as the obama camp was quick to point out mccain opposed legislation that would have forced the u s government to buy american made motorcycles

4779825 there are a lot of processes that are not included in the models
4779826 in matsui and pielkesr 2006 it was foundfrom observations of the spatial distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere in the lower latitudes that the aerosol effect on atmospheric circulations as a result of their alteration in the heating of regions of the atmosphere is 60 times greater than due to the heating effect of the human addition of well mixed greenhouse gases
4779827 was the 2003 european summer heat wave unusual in a global context
4779828 how should the result of a climate model run be presented
4779829 the unknown consequences of this added co2 i completely agree with this statement and this is what our paper is about it explores the possible consequences of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on extreme maximum temperatures the result is that they
4779830 that papers which present predictions are not valid science contributions unless they are validated by predictions

4779842 we are now a nation of christians jews muslims buddhists
4779843 id see the day that id hear something like that from a presidential candidate in this country
4779844 to think our forefathers fought and died for the right for our nation to be a christian nation and to have this wannabe raghead say with pride that we are no longer a christian nation
4779845 how far will the good people of the usa let these minorities tell us what we can and cannot do
4779846 with gods help he will still take control of this nation and we can show this anti christ and all his boot lickers

4779849 he drove to the petrol station and before he got out of his car there he was met at the drivers door by mr williams who opened the door and repeatedly punched the witness while he sat in the drivers seat
4779850 i am instructed that mr williams shouted at him that he wasnt to say anything to anybody that this was just a start and there would be more for him and his family undoubtedly and mr fowles understood it referring to the beating hed just received
4779851 he received threats and the threats were such that he paid what he could and then interest was demanded of him and every time that he paid more money was demanded and the situation for him simply spun out of control
4779852 what also played on his mind was the question of how steve williams apparently could have known he was first of all going to be at the holden hill magistrates court that morning and secondly of how he could have known he was to appear later that day for a questioning hearing at the acc
4779853 as far as mr fowles was concerned his appearance at the acc was supposed to be confidential that is what he understood but he was left in no doubt that mr williams was aware that the acc examination was occurring
4779854 your refusal to answer meant that the examination had to be adjourned indefinitely
4779855 this has resulted in opportunities to investigate serious organised crime being lost
4779856 the investigation in question related to but was not limited to illicit drug importation manufacture trafficking and supply
4779857 i dont want to overreact but i want to be prudent
4779858 so what i think were going to do in the short term is look at the reserve funds eventually
4779859 that saves a considerable amount of money about 800 million
4779860 everybody knows we had 4 gas in the last quarter and that inflation has been creeping up

4779865 id been looking at it theology while i was doing my circus degree and there were a few reasons to study
4779866 the biggest one was i got very involved with multi faith and inter religious dialogue and working with people with other faiths and that really made me look more into my own faith
4779867 it was really like this is the real path of my life circus was good but it wasnt my mainstream
4779868 i have no regrets everyones just been so supportive it really feels like this is where im being called
4779869 i was often questioning where god wanted me in life and asking questions and looking around at different things
4779870 then as soon as id made the decision everything in my life seemed to fall into place
4779871 they love it they think its really exciting ive taught some of them some human pyramids and even if they cant do it they enjoy looking at it
4779872 there are many people out there in the world who are celibate because they have to be because of their circumstances in life
4779873 their partner dying or moving on and there are many people in really horrible situations were a bit of a reminder that some people had to live like that without a choice
4779874 these days many more young people train to be teachers nurses doctors or social workers and serve the people in that way
4779875 once these works were done by religious orders because fewer young people were able to go to university for professional training
4779876 we believe the anti corruption branch and ministerial investigation provisions are at a level they need to be
4779877 i am confident that there are provisions in place to deal with public officers who abuse their official position for private benefit

4779881 like many other people he may be vindicated by the use of dna evidence which was not available at the time of his trials
4779882 it will be crucial to have the cricket bat and have it tested
4779883 if we can establish mr radford suffered a concussion or that a blow to his head caused him to behave in an autonomic or unconscious state he would be entitled to be set free
4779884 the extreme interest in this case is in relation to the involuntariness involved and that a man who may be innocent has spent so long in jail
4779885 we also need to locate the nurse who treated mr radfords head injury at one tree hill and take a statement
4779886 we will be arguing he was struck with the bat and as a result suffered a concussion which put him into a dissociative state at the time of the shooting this caused his behaviour to be involuntary like someone sleepwalking or acting unconsciously
4779887 the rtbu has been arguing that these free shuttle services have placed an increased workload on the operators as they are exposed to a higher risk environment from operating through the busiest part of the cbd for extended periods of time
4779888 with the extension occurring towards the end of next year or early 2010 there is going to be further exposure to that high risk environment
4779889 we are basing this claim on the increased flexibility transadelaide are asking for and productivity that we believe we have delivered transadelaide
4779890 we apologise to the public for the disruption to services but it is now unavoidable
4779891 they want to remove conductors because its a free service
4779892 we have said who is going to handle wheelchairs or advise passengers who might be from out of town even if they are not selling tickets they are still performing a service role and other duties

4779905 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4779906 have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4779907 a malicious attempt to unjustifiably dissuade others from dealing with iranian banks
4779908 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks

4779916 i was in high school when she hit it big
4779917 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4779918 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4779919 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4779920 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4779921 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4779922 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4779923 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4779924 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4779925 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4779926 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4779927 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4779961 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4779962 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4779963 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature

4779974 albers in the conclusion of fifty years of linear algebra you wrote i am inclined to believe that at the root of all deep mathematics there is a combinatorial insight i think that in this subject in every subject the really original really deep insights are always combinatorial and i think for the new discoveries that we need the pendulum needs to swing back and will swing back in the combinatorial direction i always thought of you as an analyst halmos people call me an analyst but i think im a born algebraist and i mean the same thing analytic versus combinatorial algebraic i think the finite case illustrates and guides and simplifies the infinite some people called me full of baloney when i asserted that the deep problems of operator theory could all be solved if we knew the answer to every finite dimensional matrix question i still have this religion that if you knew the answer to every matrix question somehow you could answer every operator question but the somehow would require genius the problem is not given an operator question to ask the same question in finite dimensions thats silly the problem is the genius is given an infinite question to think of the right finite question to ask once you thought of the finite answer then you would know the right answer to the infinite question combinatorics the finite case is where the genuine deep insight is generalizing making it infinite is sometimes intricate and sometimes difficult and i might even be willing to say that its sometimes deep but it is nowhere near as fundamental as seeing the finite structure
4779975 one of the conditions of the coastal commission involves the subterranean parking garage where well have to dig out several thousand tons of dirt
4779976 the commission didnt want any of that dirt to end up in the creek so they said we have to wait until spring after the rains are over to start that
4779977 that will give us time to get everything sorted out and be ready to go
4779978 i think i have a better project today than i had before
4779979 the coastal commission staff in santa cruz did a fantastic job it was a very good experience dealing with the coastal commission i enjoyed it
4779980 id like to publicly thank the city council members for all their help

4779982 the more educational programs successfully completed for each six months confined the lower the recidivism rate
4779983 im so and so and im an adult child of an alcoholic and a dysfunctional family
4779984 we citizens have come to feel isolated uneasy with other people especially authority figures so we became people pleasers even though we lose our own identities in the process we citizens often mistake any personal criticism as a threat
4779985 we citizens took on another compulsive personality such as a workaholic we live life from the standpoint of victims we became reactors rather than actors letting others take the initiative
4779986 we citizens became dependent personalities terrified of abandonment willing to do almost anything to hold onto a relationship in order not to be abandoned yet our country keep choosing insecure relationships
4779987 as citizens we learn to keep our feelings down and bury them deeper year after year we confuse love with pity tending to love those we can rescue even more self defeating we become addicted to excitement in all our affairs preferring constant upset to workable relationships
4779988 we did some research and found women prefer a light ale with a wedge of lime in the neck of the bottle she said
4779989 so we decided to take it to the next level to make a type of shandy with fruit instead of lemonade
4779990 and we made it a mid strength beer at 4 4 per cent rather than the normal 4 9 per cent
4779991 and instead of a six pack we put the bottles into a four pack she said
