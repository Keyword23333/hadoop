6300000 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
6300001 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
6300002 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
6300003 grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation in georgia
6300004 it is clear that the conflict has now expanded in other areas than only south ossetia
6300005 regrettably i have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground within the council on a draft statement to the press
6300006 the first thing that has to happen is that violence has got to stop and that foreign forces will have to be withdrawn
6300007 russia somehow thinks it is exempt from all the calls to cease violence from all the calls to withdraw
6300008 first of all we need to remove 1 000 guys from here within 96 hours after that the rest of the guys
6300009 the unplanned redeployment of georgian forces will have some impact in the near term however as with any change in force structure we will make adjustments to ensure sustainment of coalition operations
6300010 we do not anticipate their departure will result in a significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
6300011 they want to go home as soon as possible and help
6300012 we have the same situation in our home as here though the territory is different we have no desert

6300068 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6300075 this morning i woke up to a huge nyc sized cockroach in my bathroom sink for the first time ever forget that 10 years thing im a real new yorker now
6300076 i can look around the city and know every single site someone i know has lost their life
6300077 my confidence level is pretty high and my own ability to preserve my own life but i think about those person or persons that you know and search your heart and soul for what maybe you could have done to prevent those things from happening
6300078 workers will have empathy for the worker killed or hurt
6300079 since i love writing and were in the publishing business ive created what i hope will be a really fun site for young writers it may be basic to many of my online writing friends but may be helpful to new writers out there
6300080 it was such a tough match their serves were so strong but we wanted to win and we won the match
6300081 experience in beach volleyball comes into play in those big matches where fatigue sets in
6300082 i will pretend that the crowd was cheering for us
6300083 im excited to win the silver medal we did our best in the match and i think we played very well im proud to present such a wonderful match in front of the large audience
6300084 i hope beach volleyball will have a faster development in china through our success at the beijing games
6300085 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6300086 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions

6300088 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6300089 which conferred on mr warren the right to promote mr calzaghes next three fights
6300090 mr warren told mr calzaghe that he wanted him to sign a new promotion contract and a new management contract
6300091 during that meeting and in order to persuade mr calzaghe to sign a new promotional and management contracts mr warren told mr calzaghe that no broadcasting company other than setanta was interested in the kessler fight
6300092 setanta had reluctantly agreed to broadcast the fight but only on condition that it also had the right to broadcast mr calzaghes subsequent fight
6300093 the implication of this was that if mr calzaghe refused to sign new contracts setanta might refuse to broadcast the kessler fight which in turn might result in the cancellation of that fight
6300094 there was no agreement whether oral or in writing made between the claimant and mr calzaghe on 15 january 2008 or any other time whereby the claimant was retained to act as promoter for mr calzaghes fights after the hopkins fight

6300100 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6300101 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6300102 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6300103 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6300104 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6300105 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6300106 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6300107 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6300108 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6300111 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6300112 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6300113 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said

6300123 the townhouses did not come down until july so we just filled in the hole to make it look nice
6300124 each year we get a list of faculty that are planning to retire or leave the university at the end of the year
6300125 we then begin our search for the people that will fill those positions
6300126 these are national searches we are looking for great teachers and great scholars we look for people who like teaching in a university such as ours
6300127 someone who is interested in teaching at a liberal arts university with our relation to the church and our sense of community
6300128 i feel the new faculty can serve the university as a benefit new faculty brings in new perspectives and possibilities
6300129 they will have a full day interview during the day they will give presentations on research for the faculty group and meet with students majoring in their particular department
6300130 no i dont hit too many theyre few and far between

6300146 nothing specifically is scheduled at this time though i envision it being used during the all tlu reunion lunch on the library and chapel lawns during homecoming
6300147 hauling out the trailer several times each year to serve as a temporary stage created a considerable amount of work for our facility services crew
6300148 in addition to bringing out the stage and setting it up they had to run electricity to it many man hours were required at the expense of addressing other maintenance needs on campus the permanent stage will have the electric source immediately adjacent to it which is safer than having to run electric cables out to the temporary stage
6300149 the library lawn is used for a lot of student organization and other university activities each year
6300150 its a beautiful green open space in the center of campus and we thought the addition of a permanent stage would enhance its use and functionality the small grove of trees in the southwest corner of the library lawn provides a very nice natural backdrop and shade for the stage
6300151 during summer school i saw them building the stage and was confused why we needed a large concrete block in the middle of tlu
6300152 i dont understand why after trying to move all campus events over to the party barn that they built a stage on the library lawn
6300153 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children

6300155 it just didnt look anything like an aircraft it was horrific everything was burnt

6300157 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6300158 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers

6300163 a bicycle expedition was chosen to be our fund raising event for heart of borneo because it fit well with the conservation and environmental message we are trying to promote the bicycle is a non polluting mode of transportation therefore it is good for the environment it does not use petrol and as a result will help conserve our precious energy resources for future generations we hope using a bicycle will gain wider acceptance as the alternative mode of transportation there are staff members from hsbc and the government already setting an example by cycling to work regularly
6300164 are upperclass students who live within all tlu housing areas they are carefully selected and trained to assist residents facilitate programs and activities mediate conflicts and encourage students to make the most of their residential experience
6300165 the ra staff is in charge of programming for their areas working to resolve any roommate conflicts and work order request
6300166 they are also a resource to the students in their areas and help the students adjust to college life ras also hold desk hours for residents to stop by and check out a vacuum ping pong equipment brooms etc
6300167 resident assistants go through a two to three step process
6300168 in the spring we open up to applicants they must have a minimum of a 2 5 grade point average we then put them into groups and theyll do things like come up with a program out of 25 items on a table theyll then do an individual interview
6300169 some of the topics were expectations motivation ethics petty cash forms check in process scavenger hunt report writing programming emergency procedures behind closed doors endangering behaviors first aid cpr training tips training listening skills assessment and evaluation fire extinguisher training with the seguin fire department and they also meet with the intramural international and auxiliary directors
6300170 area coordinators are live in residence life professionals who manage the daily housing operations they supervise the paraprofessional staff manage the facilities administer residential programming and handle conduct and disciplinary matters
6300171 the ac staff provides an on call service to the university throughout the year

6300176 the leg feels good i have been in rehab getting it to where it was but of course it is not going to be a hundred percent even though i feel its getting better every day
6300177 it was definitely a grueling process as i had to do rehab and then get surgery three weeks later ive taken it slow but it is still a process every day
6300178 it really did not teach me anything but i saw things last season that i wanted to change being a quarterback people look to you as a leader so watching some of my senior teammates struggle last season just broke my heart
6300179 we went 2 8 last season so that plays a lot with my mental psych to get beat by some of the teams last year alone just gets me mentally prepared and ready to come out this season and do so much better
6300180 returner wise there was not much of a change we lost some players but that is something as a team we can not dwell on too much
6300181 i feel he will be very effective as i expect him to gain even more yards this season
6300182 its looking good some players to watch are dwight bonner jarrad mcadams and adam franklin who was out last year due to injuries but is back this season
6300183 i feel i had an advantage as coach parker was a coach at my former high school so the same intensity we had there is the same coach parker and the rest of the coaches have here

6300195 the basis of the co op came from ruben duran who is the director for new congregations in the elca
6300196 ruben challenged us to do bigger things some members of intermission wanted to be a part of this new idea and some didnt we realized that some of us had different callings
6300197 we have ministries in seguin and san marcos and extend our likewise activities as far as austin
6300198 were pursuing two movements 1 to find a deeper more holistic spirituality 2 follow jesus into the world doing likewise hoping to live out the dreams of god in the world

6300200 this is a surveillance detection and early warning system to provide information to the japan defense agency and to the u s government
6300201 israel will have no direct access to the data gathered by the system and can only hope the american operators will pass on the information as and when israel needs it for self defense rather than when it suits us interests
6300202 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

6300205 she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6300206 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6300207 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6300208 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6300209 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6300210 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6300211 christy myxs father has asked me if i have any stories from the war to tell
6300212 my role in the war was to work for us military intelligence and i spent most of my time behind german lines
6300213 our job at one stage was to gather as much information as we could about german activities in czechoslovakia and report them to our superiors there were two of us working together myself and
6300214 since we were the two with the best spoken german we were chosen to go like among the locals near pilzen and to find people who we could coerce into giving us information
6300215 this worked several times for us until we spoke to a particular farmer by the name of nekovar though i cannot remember his first name
6300216 nekovar was a funny man who told some great jokes and often made fun of the different german soldiers no matter how much he hated them i got on particularly well with him as he made me laugh all the time
6300217 my colleague however was more practical and he was growing impatient with our meetings with nekovar since he wouldnt have any serious information we could use
6300218 so one time instead of visiting his house he asked him to join us where we were staying for some beer and whiskey we got him so drunk that he would have had to stay with us for the night and my colleague started asking him all sorts of questions getting quite angry when he refused to answer
6300219 eventually he started slapping him and pushing him around i guess i was being the good cop and i did want to know what he could tell us but i could not help feel sorry for him as he was clearly a good man who cared about his family above all else
6300220 and so we went on and on asking him to give us something we could use when finally he told us all about the operations of some german soldiers who used his land for military exercises he was able to give him the names of the generals he dealt with and what kind of exercises they were doing
6300221 once i thought he had told us enough i told my colleague to leave him alone and i said to nevokar it was ok to go on up to bed and that he could sleep in my room for the night i would bunk downstairs
6300222 in my bedroom there was a pipe running across the ceiling the next morning we found nevokar hanging by the neck from the pipe he was either sure that the germans would know it was he who had given the information or afraid we would never let him go until he had told us more
6300223 i didnt witness anywhere near as much death as most did during the war but finding nevokars body is a moment that will never leave me
6300224 we think thats a tremendous shame because we see that as our role to get those exhibitions but they are very expensive and that is where some of the cuts would come
6300225 theyre not going to be stopped altogether well just do them in other years one or two at a time
6300226 even setting aside the efficiency dividend the costs have increased more than 50 per cent in the last four years of activity to the level now where weve taken a decision to reduce the quality of collecting in that area
6300227 our electricity bill would be 500 000 this year with no appropriation to make up for that
6300228 you cant show the collection in darkness and you cant turn off the air conditioning to preserve a 3 3 billion collection
6300229 people would be horrified if a painting or some relic were stolen and it turned out there was one person on duty or something like that
6300230 if you go to archives for example and wish to get some information you were charged a fee and some fee is reasonable but the pressure on those agencies is to increase those fees
6300231 and the war memorial presumably will be under some sort of pressure to charge fees for additional services
6300232 but to be perfectly honest weve had this arrangement efficiency dividends now for over 20 years
6300233 it has got increasingly tighter for no good logical reason other than a revenue raiser
6300234 are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to health care to trying to send your children to college keep skyrocketing
6300235 why was he speaking down to me i dont trust him hes too snooty and stuck up he seems to think hes doing us a favor by making time to ask for our votes
6300236 supporters are calling on hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration to intervene phone 613 996 4974 or email
6300237 to support jeremy call or email hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration and ask her to intervene in this case phone 613 996 4974 email
6300238 a ctions demonstrations and pickets will take place in cities and towns all across canada
6300239 the density of it is too great for that area
6300240 all the amenities that go with that that make up a liveable community go out the window
6300241 you dont need to have an engineers degree to know the amount of pressure it puts on infrastructure
6300242 i am very confident that well be able to allay any fears that people have or any concerns that some people may have
6300243 the solution should serve the interests of cypriots and not of turkey the foreign powers should encourage turkey to display a positive stance on the cyprus issue
6300244 of course turkeys stance will be judged when negotiations begin he said referring to the direct negotiations which will start september 3rd between president christofias and the turkish cypriot leader turkish cypriots should be given the chance to negotiate freely and ankara must support a solution that will reunify the island
6300245 should follow a clear stance and support a solution for one state in cyprus
6300246 we want an agreed solution and not an imposed one a solution that will serve the interests of both sides who will in the end have to live with that solution but this does not mean that turkey is absolved of responsibility
6300247 has always been the position of the greek cypriot side and should not surprise anyone when expressed in public
6300248 practical ways of cooperation and coordination of efforts to support overseas cypriots
6300249 full support of the greek prime minister the greek foreign minister and the whole country to the initiatives of president christofias to achieve a solution to the cyprus problem
6300250 am i speaking to tushar same tushar who writes on india pr blog
6300251 many people believe so you are not the only one anyways go ahead what was so urgent
6300252 well i know i can dance i am a good dancer i told my employer before i joined them that i can really dance well and they were pretty impressed with the fact that i can dance they felt that dancing is critical to the job i am going to perform
6300253 listen to me completely i told them that i know dancing i can act as well and they felt it was an added advantage i further told them about things i need to learn to become a complete fit in the organization i told them about need for direction and support from the superiors and colleagues on a regular basis before i become a complete professional in the field they promised all because they felt that dancing is the critical to the job i am going to peform
6300254 i started dancing was trying to do other things as well initially they liked my dancing but later on started feeling that dancing is not everything i reminded them about the commitment they gave me about providing me proper learning experience and guidance to perform as a professional in the field they said you need to learn on the job when i started showing some new dance moves amp innovative steps they said its not required you just do what is required of you dancing can be one of the requirements but not everything
6300255 the issue is that they hired me because i can dance well and now they are saying dancing is not everything and i cant dance so i am confused what should i do should i change the employer i am learning things on my own but again i feel cheated will i be able to dance again the way i used to
6300256 its quite a common story and i am not surprised however i may have some solution for you lets see whether you can dance the way you used to after we speak
6300257 its getting really tight now for the last few places but im not feeling the pressure
6300258 i see it as a challenge and in fact im enjoying it
6300259 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s it is different in that bolt has a bigger edge than owens in his finals
6300260 bolt in a way if he maintains that in the future will bring a mark like jesse owens
6300261 cancellation of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad is a painful step
6300262 she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6300263 taking place at 500 meters from our offices this was an invitation for a nice field test
6300264 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6300265 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6300266 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6300267 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6300268 i am so happy with my level of play today
6300269 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6300270 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6300271 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate

6300289 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that
6300290 ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
6300291 my allegiance to senator john mccain becomes stronger with any assault that tries to deter my loyalty to him
6300292 i can only pray that good people see roseanne for what she is sick of mind
6300293 i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me
6300294 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6300295 creo que nuestro destino es ganar el oro los dos equipos merecen estar en la final pero creo que seremos nosotros los que terminaremos proclam ndonos campeones
6300296 tenemos mucha confianza pero habr que esperar a ver qu pasa porque argentina tiene jugadores como messi ag ero riquelme y mascherano en su equipo que nos van a poner el partido dif cil
6300297 pero ellos tampoco lo tendr n f cil tenemos individualidades de gran val a y el entrenador ha construido un equipo muy s lido trabajamos duro por nuestros compa eros y estamos formando una defensa cada vez m s compacta
6300298 s lo hemos concedido tres goles a lo largo de este torneo y creo que estamos mejorando como equipo partido tras partido en mi opini n nuestra mejor actuaci n la realizamos contra b lgica y nuestra segunda mejor actuaci n fue contra costa de marfil en cuartos de final queremos estar en nuestra mejor forma en el encuentro final y creo que lo estaremos
6300299 es una sensaci n muy gratificante una sensaci n incre ble
6300300 saber que todo el trabajo duro que hemos hecho antes y durante la competici n nos ha llevado a la final y a tener opciones de conquistar el oro es incre ble
6300301 ver lo que hemos mejorado desde nuestro primer partido y luego en cada uno de los encuentros que hemos disputado es absolutamente maravilloso hemos crecido como equipo durante este torneo y ahora vamos a pek n llegar a la final era uno de nuestros objetivos cuando llegamos aqu y nuestra nueva misi n es ganar el oro
6300302 vamos a tener oportunidades y creo que con los delanteros que tenemos vamos a aprovecharlas
6300303 tenemos unos cuantos jugadores experimentados arriba y creo que marcaremos a lo largo de la historia ya hemos alcanzado unas cuantas finales de torneos y seguro que eso nos va a ayudar
6300304 no resulta f cil motivarse para nuestro ltimo partido pero tenemos que hacerlo porque vale una medalla ol mpica
6300305 vamos a tener que jugar contra un semifinalista derrotado claro est
6300306 me habr a gustado mucho m s hacerlo contra un equipo que ha ganado pero ya nos hemos cruzado con brasil as que me alegra bastante que vayamos a enfrentarnos de nuevo brasil no fue capaz de abrir brecha en nuestro sistema defensivo y creo que nosotros nos mostramos superiores en algunas fases
6300307 en este dif cil momento tengo que mantener la calma y ayudar al equipo a recuperarse contra b lgica est bamos trabajando para conseguir el oro pero a veces las cosas simplemente no salen lo nico que podemos hacer es seguir creyendo en nosotros
6300308 a mans moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills producing thereby the ideal complete athlete
6300309 if you see that in your head you start running through all the scenarios of what can happen
6300310 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6300311 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6300312 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6300313 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6300314 he sent me an e mail in all lowercase letters with no punctuation and no photo
6300315 i dont usually respond to things like that but he said he could beat me at scrabble that was interesting
6300316 i walked in and hes in the middle of the hearing
6300317 he knew what i looked like because i sent him a photo i figured hed be the guy in the big chair wearing a black dress
6300318 he pointed his finger down at me where i was sitting in the row and he crooks it as if to say you
6300319 i always told him even if we never married i would stay with him because this is the best relationship of my life
6300320 ive been thinking about trying to get engaged to you for a long time and i cant quite seem to do it
6300321 when he repeated after judge washington it felt official it was official and he had never gone that far before
6300322 when people who love you offer to do things for you let them everything they do will make you happy
6300323 i got botox that was my crazy money 330 i only did it once and ill never do it again but it was fun having it
6300324 its unfair to compare new jerseys offer with no details attached to this final agreement
6300325 the lease will be a revenue generator for the prpa and were keeping all the vendors together 1 100 people who work there and thousands of truckers who run through there delivering food across the region and as the state of the art facility theyll attract new shipping and vendors that benefits the region and the support community
6300326 it did hit home a little for the all around
6300327 honestly i go by everything happens for a reason for some reason the judges werent giving me the normal scores that im used to but they had a reason for it if they saw something we didnt i respect that i was meant to have the silver
6300328 i was proud that she finally got a gold medal now we can both say that were olympic champions that will be really cool
6300329 i competed a full meet about five times the only gymnast on my team to do that i feel ive given everything i have physically and mentally its just the end of the road its normal to feel a little down on the last day because youve given everything and you dont have much left in you
6300330 i was making uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
6300331 i think he was getting nervous just like i was
6300332 i was doing routine after routine without hitting them the way i did in previous competitions he was getting serious he told me to stop and take a second and gather myself
6300333 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did
6300334 the pakistani army absolutely understands its priority is not india but is internal
6300335 some of the thinking in the army is in accordance with what petraeus has done in iraq
6300336 they see the need for quick impact projects such as those funded by u s army commanders in troubled iraqi districts
6300337 if there is anyone in the field that can beat me that guy is an absolute legend
6300338 hes a great guy hes obviously been to the depths in his personal life and to come back is a great story lance armstrong epic
6300339 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6300340 at the last bit i didnt know what was going on
6300341 i just wanted to lie down and have a sleep but before i knew it i was on a stretcher
6300342 i knew maarten finished well so it was important to stay with him
6300343 i need to learn to swim straight i know that sounds silly
6300344 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6300345 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6300346 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6300347 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6300348 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6300349 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6300350 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6300351 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6300352 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6300353 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6300354 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6300355 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6300356 a reunion of three artists new work and new directions

6300360 i started showing pigs when i was 3 years old in the open class at the putnam county fair i joined the delphos livestock 4 h club and started showing at the allen county fair when i was 9 my advisor john noonan gets us our books and some of our shavings and if we have questions in our meetings he helps answer them and our advisors come out to check our projects
6300361 ive learned how to take care of my pigs and have gained more experience through 4 h
6300362 im very proud of her she works really hard we make trips to the farm every night to feed and walk the pigs its her project she puts a lot of effort into it
6300363 classification is a special feature of paralympic sport although classification is also used in olympic sport the challenges associated with classifying athletes according to sex or body mass are relatively minor
6300364 classification in paralympic sport is more challenging because athletes must be classified according to how much their disability impacts on their sports performance and the range of disabilities varies enormously including spinal cord injury cerebral palsy limb deficiency brain injury and vision impairment
6300365 one of the great things about the paralympic movement and its system of classification is that it provides an avenue for people with disabilities to pursue sporting excellence regardless of the extent of that disability
6300366 the paralympic games are just a tremendous sporting event excellent competition and truly inspiring performances
6300367 for me the olympics are a great test event a sort of pre paralympic games if you like
6300368 kaj naj s tem da sem bil vnovi najbolj i igralec slovenije

6300377 winds will strengthen tonight and tomorrow with squally heavy showers
6300378 i just dont know what the fuck was wrong with me i mean this just turned out as an experiment but it ballooned out of control
6300379 this is really stupid but i want an all black gangbang

6300385 i was just in the neighborhood and wanted to say hi
6300386 kozmusu nismo dali obljub ki jih nato ne bi izpolnili
6300387 odlo no odgovarja predsednik oks janez kocijan i in zanika trditve da je napovedal finan ne nagrade tudi za etrta peta ali esta mesta na oi kar mu je o ital nosilec zlate medalje
6300388 je zatrdil kocijan i in postregel s podatkom da se je s sodelavci o tej temi pogovarjal s predstavniki komitejev sosednih dr av in pri el do spoznanja da tovrstna praksa tudi tam ni uveljavljena

6300390 a ctions demonstrations and pickets will take place in cities and towns all across canada
6300391 a key pillar of the u s strategy to pacify iraq is in danger of collapsing
6300392 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6300393 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6300394 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go bacck to zero i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6300395 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6300396 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6300397 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6300398 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6300399 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6300400 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6300401 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6300402 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want
6300403 this work is often dangerous but it must go on those who died on august 18th 2003 would have it no other way

6300406 it is important to remember what brings you together not only the differences
6300407 to negotiate a broad political deal which could then be put to a confirmatory referendum backed by all sides
6300408 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
6300409 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6300410 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6300411 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6300417 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6300418 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6300419 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message

6300423 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths

6300463 the first two weeks of practice are the most important weeks for every coaching staff but its especially important when you begin the season with a conference game
6300464 when i was at duquesne we always had a couple non conference games before we started conference play that gave the coaching staff more time to evaluate talent and correct any problem areas you dont have any wiggle room when you start the season with a conference game
6300465 our goal is to play good football across the board in every phase of the game
6300466 we want to do everything the right way and do it with intensity and effort
6300467 it would be silly to make any predictions especially since im new to the program and not familiar with the conference
6300468 i do know that the interstate conference is considered one of the strongest in class aa and this year will be no different
6300469 getting off to a good start is very important this program has had very little success over the past 20 years the key to building a successful program is building confidence a good start would really help
6300470 it was a good learning experience for both the players and the coaches
6300471 we had a lot to cover in a short amount of time we had three practices a day with the emphasis of installing a new system on offense and defense
6300472 the previous coaching staff used multiple defensive fronts we will be running the miami 4 3 they used a spread offense mainly due to their injury situation at quarterback we will be using a multiple pro offense
6300473 both mike and zach looked good in our first scrimmage against belle vernon
6300474 i havent decided who will start but both will be playing possibly both ways
6300475 we played belle vernon a class aaa team in our first scrimmage
6300476 i could have picked an easier team but that wouldnt have helped us i wanted to find a quality program that would challenge us we learned quite a bit about our personnel during the scrimmage
6300477 ira is one of three coaches who came with me from duquesne
6300478 we have a whole bunch of doubters who dont think we can do it we have to prove weve still got some good people on this team
6300479 i told the kids there are eight to 10 schools in quad a that are good enough to win it
6300480 the kids want to be back in the race for the conference and wpial titles i expect to be one of those eight to 10 teams
6300481 they were all very competitive and athletic jon brings that same kind of leadership
6300482 it seemed like we were losing a starter a week
6300483 they have a strong tradition im sure theyll be very competitive
6300484 woodland hills played a lot of young guys last year
6300485 i like to open with a very competitive schedule to see where we are
6300486 itll be a great challenge for the kids and we can see how theyll react and play in a big time environment it will gives us a good way to evaluate
6300487 everyone keeps asking us if the team is going to be good
6300488 a victory down there it would be important to prove everybody wrong its important to prove we have talent this year
6300489 even if we didnt play them seton and canevin are definitely our rivals people are talking about that
6300490 the kids get to see each other at the mall and out in public and whatnot as a coach you worry about that because you hope it stays on the field and doesnt slip out into the streets but it should be fun for everyone involved being in close proximity with your rivals is what high school sports is all about
6300491 i dont think going to double a is a bad thing
6300492 obviously well be competing against teams that have the same number of kids we were running 30 kids out on the field and opposing teams would be running 70 or 80 the numbers on the field should be about the same
6300493 the hard part is going to be the expectations of dropping down people in the community expect us to do well thats never a bad thing gong into a season though theres high hopes and the kids are all excited and ready to go
6300494 weve got to practice hard so were ready to play next week
6300495 theres no room for mistakes weve got to come out ready to play because we have to win as many games as possible
6300496 the kids like that theyve been saying i have mixed emotions
6300497 which i dont but its always nice to go home
6300498 i know a lot of people there if it wasnt for steel valley i wouldnt be where i am right now ill always be grateful but im at keystone oaks now

6300512 we scrimmage but we encourage our players to take care of their teammates ive always believed in that
6300513 some coaches believe you ought to knock the crap out of your teammates or youll get in bad habits when the games start i dont believe that
6300514 i believe were all on the same team weve got to protect each other and realize were practicing for the opponent ive always said when an army practices for the enemy they dont use live bullets in practice

6300724 kegiatan siber meskipun bersifat virtual tetapi dikategorikan sebagai tindakan dan perbuatan hukum yang nyata secara yuridis untuk ruang siber sudah tidak pada tempatnya lagi untuk mengkategorikan sesuatu dengan ukuran dan kualifikasi konvensional untuk dapat dijadikan obyek dan perbuatan sebab jika cara ini yang ditempuh akan terlalu banyak kesulitan dan hal hal yang lolos dari jerat hukum kegiatan siber adalah kegiatan virtual tetapi berdampak sangat nyata meskipun alat buktinya bersifat elektronik dengan demikian subyek pelakunya harus dikualifikasikan pula sebagai telah melakukan perbuatan hukum secara nyata salah satu hal penting adalah masalah keamanan terdapat tiga pendekatan untuk mempertahankan keamanan di cyberspace pertama adalah pendekatan teknologi kedua pendekatan sosial budaya etika dan ketiga pendekatan hukum untuk mengatasi gangguan keamanan pendekatan teknologi memang mutlak dilakukan mengingat tanpa pendekatan teknologi suatu jaringan akan sangat mudah disusupi dintersepsi atau diakses secara ilegal dan tanpa hak 3 oleh karena itu pendekatan hukum dan sosial budaya etika sebagai bentuk pendekatan berikutnya menjadi sangat penting

6300750 somewhere along the line in my youth i wore 17 the players voted to take number 30 away from nick swisher and give it to me but i said no
6300751 ive gotten adjusted and the guys here are pretty good they have a lot of fun but once the game starts they go out and play hard and play to win
6300752 it was an informal meeting just to say hello and congratulations
6300753 after i asked him if he was getting hazardous duty pay i told him if you have something for me can get something for me i wont hold you up
6300754 i knew the situation being in the last year of my contract and everybody knew pretty much which way they were going to go
6300755 if we had started off on fire it would have been different but we didnt and the result is that im gone adam dunn is gone and david ross is gone
6300756 theyre so worried about just wanting to be competitive they should be talking about winning you have to want to win
6300757 that goes for everybody front office to the players to the scouts to the fans to management
6300758 when i came back after hitting my 600th home run my reception was awesome that should be for everybody not just because somebody reached a milestone the fans should put all their energy into supporting every at bat everybody needs to pull together
6300759 usually im the one making the outs in big innings moving the game along
6300760 i enjoy it but the ultimate goal is to win a championship and if you play long enough numbers will happen
6300761 thats one of the things said about me in cincinnati about my contract situation when i never ever said anything
6300762 i told him things that were said were false and for somebody who works for the team brantley to say that wasnt right
6300763 in 20 years of chasing a baseball around i never complained about my contract
6300764 if there was one person on that team he would say something like that to it would be me
6300765 and he said the clubhouse is really quiet with me and dunn gone he said he started to yell something at me the other day forgetting that im gone

6300778 for the last part of it i was delirious i wanted it so bad
6300779 ive given it everything the stretcher at the end was a bit mad but ive got something to show for it i felt a bit violated to be honest people swimming all over me and the last lap was a real struggle

6300788 when we use drugs you have to use it at the right dose too low a dose doesnt give you the effect you want too high a dose has the chance of producing too much of an effect or just basic toxicity
6300789 its a window you try and stay within in the first case we were worried about getting too much in now were worried about not getting enough in
6300790 if youre talking about substances that you have to have because of critical medical conditions like cancer or if you have had a kidney or some kind of transplant or if youve had a previous heart attack you have to get enough into the bloodstream to produce an effect
6300791 so if you want to get the most chance of having the most consistent uniform effect what you should really do is take your medication with a whole glass of water on an empty stomach
6300792 we had expected that the drug levels were going to go up in actual fact they went down that was a bit of a surprise to us
6300793 common orange juice which is probably drunk a lot more than grapefruit juice
6300794 but im sure well find many other drugs for which this happens
6300795 because a lot of my patients and i imagine other peoples patients describe how they take their morning pills with a glass of orange juice thats how they remember to take it every day
6300796 so theyd be having their juice in the morning with it
6300797 people shouldnt panic and change their consumption of fruit juices based on this information
6300798 its not even fully clear yet which drugs it does it to and to what an extent it does it
6300799 was a real big deal because you can kill somebody with too much felodipine
6300800 there arent too many drugs where that is a real real danger
6300801 until we know more people taking certain medications should be perhaps talking to their doctor or pharmacist
6300802 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed we are always eager to get other information from different channels but when you are in a so called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed
6300803 the more things change the more they stay the same
6300804 businesses want the control and savings that windows mobile affords in an innovative and elegant package that keeps their users happy

6300806 are you tired of that same old leadership in d c
6300807 its time to win the hearts of the world back
6300808 each one of those small steps makes a difference to the bigger goal
6300809 to draw out the soul of things with a syllogism is as impossible as to draw out leviathan with a hook
6300810 i cannot agree with your characterization of an exciting movement that is taking place here in ontario
6300811 its not what mr obama expected going into his convention five points down
6300812 and it puts additional pressure on him to make a good choice
6300813 and then to define himself and mccain with a rousing speech
6300814 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games
6300815 all id ever dreamed of doing was being in the olympics
6300816 at 17 i had a sponsor and top trainers wanted to take me on i was competing with kelly sotherton who came fifth in the beijing heptathlon last week and doing really well my mums attic is full of boxes of medals
6300817 with the olympics going on its like everything has gone full circle it couldnt have been weirder instead of competing in beijing i was staring at a prison sentence i was all prepared for it i refused to buy food and went into court with a toothbrush and an overnight bag
6300818 shortly before 11pm on monday 18 august 2008 police received a call for assistance from two officers who were being assaulted at mottram towers shaw heath stockport
6300819 a patrol attended and a 36 year old man and a 26 year old man were arrested on suspicion of assault
6300820 he didnt force me he said if you want to do it you can take my zanjeer
6300821 there was no way you were a victim of what was going on in the mosque where you
6300822 the truth is as long as you could get hold of a zanjeer you were happy and wanted to do it
6300823 i did want to use it at the end because i heard somebody say this is the last session and after this the matam is going to finish
6300824 but under 16 wasnt allowed that is how he did wrong i wanted to do it but he shouldnt have given me the zanjeer thats the main thing
6300825 for a young aged boy to do it with an adult zanjeer it is very harmful
6300826 we always had our ups and downs and when we argued we argued bad bags were packed and everything
6300827 but this time wed been arguing and she came back home packed her bags and that was it she moved out
6300828 when i look back on it now its been a right farce a real joke but im gutted my whole life has turned upside down
6300829 we were going to go off just the two of us and get married in gretna green like a fairytale
6300830 then we were going to come back and fly off to spain where we had planned to live
6300831 i have been to spain before and liked it so we were just going to go on a whim and see what happened
6300832 we know that greater manchester is home to thousands of football fans so as the new football season kicks off we are urging anyone whos tuning in live to watch their team to make sure they have a valid tv licence
6300833 we netted more than 1 380 evaders across greater manchester during the three weeks of euro 2008 so we are urging people not to risk getting caught out yet again
6300834 tv licensing would always rather people get a licence than risk prosecution which is why we are making sure that everyone is aware of the need to be covered
6300835 parks should be safe places for children nearby there is a play area where any bolts sticking out from equipment quite rightly have rubber caps on them
6300836 little boys do climb on fences and im really concerned that someone could be severely injured unless hazards like this are made safe
6300837 we got a call from my mother in law to say harvey had been injured and rushed over to see him
6300838 he was very upset as well as being quite badly gashed by the bolt we got there and his chest was seeping with blood it was pretty bad he was really hurt and upset
6300839 i told them what had happened and they said they would investigate but the bolts are still there
6300840 they jag out and are at eyeball height for toddlers
6300841 little children are nosy and inquisitive and i am sure he was watching people play on the pitch
6300842 it is a council owned park that is very popular and the council have a duty to make it safe i am not bothered about any compensation i just do not want other children to be injured
6300843 harveys parents are keen to ensure that what happened to their little boy doesnt happen to other children and we are pursuing a claim accordingly
6300844 whoever did this is dangerous they may not have intended to murder the girls but that does not make them any less dangerous
6300845 we have a policy of reviewing historic cases particularly the most serious unsolved crimes
6300846 no murder investigation is ever considered closed without being detected all cases remain open in the hope further information will come to light
6300847 we would encourage anyone with any information about a crime no matter how long ago to contact the police
6300848 not a day goes by when i dont think of her i just hope we get justice for the girls if someone knows who did this please come forward
6300849 the police have not been to see me since the week of the inquest i couldnt face going it was too upsetting
6300850 i find its a good way to relax when im not flying but im not ready to retire from flying just yet
6300851 he was the same as he had been all week he hadnt slept for weeks
6300852 i had to leave him because i had to take my daughter to school we got to school and my daughter always phoned him he said have a lovely day and she said okay see you later
6300853 i noticed the doors to the stable were slightly ajar i just ran to the stables normally it would be locked
6300854 we felt that he was a low risk because he didnt have concrete plans and because he said his wife and daughter were a preventive factor
6300855 he became very agitated and worried and was clearly under a lot of stress
6300856 ive heard that he was acutely stressed with pressures relating to his work and had initially sought to get help
6300857 it was clear from the statement from his gp that there were very real concerns about his well being and it was clear also that he had considered the possibility of taking his own life although he had assured mental health professionals that he wouldnt take that step
6300858 his widow told us that as the days went by he became increasingly more anxious as he went about his day to day activities prior to april 18
6300859 i have no doubt that he intended to die my verdict is that he took his own life
6300860 it has been the most popular exhibition ever held at the museum and one of the most talked about events in the city
6300861 weve had an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests and our visitor book is full of comments which demonstrate how the exhibition has positively affected peoples lives
6300862 many people came out of curiosity for gunther von hagens work and left feeling genuinely inspired about the incredible complexity of the human body and the need to look after it
6300863 if it hadnt been for josie id have cancelled the wedding i was absolutely devastated were just lucky the priest is a family friend because he had to delay the service by 40 minutes
6300864 her mum came banging on my door in all her finery and when i got there she was just stood in the bedroom crying with the 22 inch zip gaping open
6300865 the last month was a stand out for me it was winter in south america and people were looking at me like i was some kind of crazy man because it was so cold but i hardly ever had to unpack my tent the farmers were inviting me into their homes and would not let me sleep outside everywhere i went i was given a rack of lamb and a floor to lie on
6300866 we went from vancouver to san francisco and it got me thinking
6300867 i know the charity was a great one and this seemed like a great way of making some money for them
6300868 to be honest that will probably be more difficult than the ride itself
6300869 i think it sees sarah and me as prison warders

6300881 stalking is a frightening tactic and has ended in murder
6300882 there is nothing amusing or enticing to those who are its victims who suffer its tragic consequences for the rest of their lives
6300883 theneighbours com au and thestalker com au sites were closed after a number of complaints
6300884 we decided to suspend the neighbours because it has an m rating which means the authorities had already determined it required a higher censorship than the stalker which has an l rating
6300885 people shouldnt have to be subjected to stalking and its outrageous for jim beam to treat it as a joke or a game
6300886 jim beam shouldnt be allowed to use sexist and violent behaviour in order to sell their product
6300887 to be promoting behaviour thats violent and criminal is just an outrage it shows they have no sense of whats appropriate
6300888 this ad is going to cause the victims of stalking intense anguish it might cause some people to relive the worst moments of their life
6300889 no alcohol manufacturer should stoop to this level and the fact that they did shows a complete lack of respect
6300890 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years
6300891 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6300892 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank
6300893 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6300894 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6300895 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6300896 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6300897 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans
6300898 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do
6300899 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6300900 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george
6300901 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6300905 i havent spoken to national parks and wildlife this morning dr blyde said
6300906 i have heard a lot of noise from all over the country talking about what happens to the whale down the track
6300907 but we need to take one step at a time in an emergency this is an emergency the whale needs to be feed
6300908 weve had numerous discussions with national parks and there are logistical problems with just about every option we think about
6300909 im on the gold coast as far as i know ill be going about my business as usual this morning and am just waiting to hear from them
6300910 we are there to give advice to national parks and wildlife he said
6300911 i figure the buffalo were there first the elk were there first the wolves were there first
6300912 i figure these animals should be given more the right of way to roam
6300913 our mission is also to restore the connections between people and bison
6300914 the farther out of hand the disease gets the harder its going to be to fix
6300915 for the tribes theres deep cultural and spiritual meaning there
6300916 people say oh you just want to turn the clock back and go back to the 1800s thats not the mission were not talking about millions of buffalo
6300917 were going to be watching to make sure theres continued management throughout the relocation process

6300930 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6300931 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6300932 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6300933 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6300934 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6300935 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6300936 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6300937 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6300938 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6300939 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6300940 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6300941 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6300942 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6300943 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6300944 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6300945 those terms are not the same as in the western world
6300946 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6300947 this vaccine should be able to prevent about 70 percent of cervical cancer
6300948 the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown
6300949 the real impact of hpv vaccination on cervical cancer will not be observable for decades
6300950 most of the information people have right now leads them to believe that if theyre vaccinated with gardasil theyre protected for life and thats just not true
6300951 these reports are from conditions that have occurred following the vaccination
6300952 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious

6300968 the possession of this volume of such material and the manner of its storage demonstrates knowledge by defendant of the materials contents

6300972 as christ sustains a twofold relation to believers one in the charactter of their surety bound to satisfy justice in their behalf the other in the character of their head and lord operating in them by the animating and directing influence of his spirit so he had a twofold end in his death and sufferings one the payment of a price of redemption for us to justice the other to set before us an example worthy of imitation hence his sufferings may be viewed either as satisfactory or as exemplary the mentioning of the one end does not exclude but supposes the other

6300988 the majority of researchers working with human embryonic stem cells hescs cells which produce any type of specialized adult cells in the human body use animal based materials for culturing the cells but because these materials are animal based they could transmit viruses and other pathogens to the hescs making the cells unsuitable for medical use now a stem cell scientist at uc riverside has devised a method of growing hescs in the lab that uses no animal derived materials an important advance in the use of hescs for future medical purposes

6300992 even conceding that the legislators resigned their seats before joining the bjp does it not amount to an insult to the voters who elected them in the first place

6301004 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time

6301012 if we dont do anything in ten years from now well be importing 80 and i promise you if were importing 80 oil will be up to 300 per barrel and we will be broke
6301013 now to do that i want to take the wind develop it in the great plains of the united states which is a huge asset unharvested because we had cheap oil
6301014 theres no question we cannot stand to have this much money going out of the country in ten years time the 700 billion will be closer to ten trillion 700 billion times ten of course is 7 trillion but itll be closer to ten trillion than seven because the price of oil will go up
6301015 the boy had been pranking around in the garden having a competition with his cousin when they were breaking wind and lighting it right behind him was a petrol can and that just flashed i think he must have won the competition but he will have some nasty burns now
6301016 it is a warning not to mess around with fire
6301017 this is my fourth store some of them didnt have them and some were overpriced
6301018 im already up in the 200 range just on school supplies alone that doesnt even include clothes
6301019 were seeing a need vs want retail year and people are buying the needed items the things that are needed for school versus the thrill items or some of the fashion items are getting set aside theyre not buying
6301020 its getting ridiculous this year the consumer is a huge winner for example crayola crayons they may cost us far more than were selling them for two or three times and you need to do that if youre in the game you need to do that
6301021 70 to 80 percent of items bought in retail business are impulse items you dont plan on buying them but somewhere along the way you buy it and thats what everyone is hoping for
6301022 so far weve had a pretty good back to school its not record breaking its pretty good a little bit up this year in sales profits we dont know the jurys still out
6301023 it gets a bad rap for injuries because we have people that arent doing it right
6301024 we think we have to get through it really fast and get kids throwing these skills on the floor in reality were hurting them
6301025 in the 40 years that ive been teaching ive never had an acl tear and very very minor injuries maybe two or three broken limbs
6301026 but the reason is im conditioning the body to make it strong enough to do the skills before they do the skills
6301027 and then its just being smart dont do things that are crazy
6301028 we are there to protect the athlete because we know that this is a sport that has inherent risks
6301029 i cannot dispute the fact that there are injuries in cheerleading certainly there are
6301030 but truly i do believe that the risks of cheerleading are not as great as the benefits finding out what the studies are is that going to prevent injuries no the injury prevention is going to come from coaching education proper training of the athletes giving them the right environment and the right opportunities
6301031 like torturing them sometimes and like sometimes i did that to animals i hurt animals because i didnt know how to deal with any of my past and didnt know how to tell people how i felt i held it in a lot
6301032 i knew it was getting to the point where i needed to turn my life around
6301033 when the girls first come in some are happy to be here but many of them dont want to be here up front
6301034 its made a huge difference like how much the staff care for you theyre there to listen to you there are groups that you go and help you the staff are the mains ones who help you
6301035 we really strive to provide holistic environment we work with their family their school their behavioral needs that they need and try to bring that all together so they can be at a place where they can go back to their communities and be successful and integrate back into the community
6301036 when i was 14 i was taken into foster care because of sexual abuse
6301037 it made me stronger my biggest thing right now is i want to go to college and help other teenagers like me and the staff at the abbott house really helped me figure that out they made such a difference in my life and i want to be able help some other teenagers and help them
6301038 ive actually have spoken to my dad a few times because of the abbott house helping me look at how i can forgive someone for harming me and i still see my birth parents all the time yeah i can move on
6301039 i would like to see the girls that have a hard time realize that they can have a better life if they are willing to put in effort and make it work
6301040 we all know that this issue is a very controversial and devisive issue and that this information should not be sent home in childrens backpacks
6301041 they have exclusive rights and control of all of the content of the document
6301042 and because of that increase in numbers weve seen so many of these women are moms right here in our own community as good business people we want to reach out to the people that need our help and because of the increase we saw we made the decision to purchase an ad that we felt like would reach those middle aged mothers and fathers whove possibly experienced an abortion
6301043 i wasnt sure i agreed with you about the forge but now theyve pretty well shown me that theyre totally out there
6301044 the plans for a wal mart supercenter at a closed drive in theater in monsey have been withdrawn by the prospective developer
6301045 we believe the project would have been a great success and huge improvement over the existing conditions
6301046 the concerns of the township cannot be met and the project will not be approved
6301047 and you need to have a regional solution to traffic route 59 is a two lane highway
6301048 we work very hard to raise our families the right way
6301049 and the supervisor understood that preserving our lifestyle is something thats very important to us
6301050 these are not people who were schooled in the tactics of public protesting or who even felt comfortable doing it
6301051 they never imagined they could beat a giant like wal mart
6301052 a lot of us sent the mailing back to them with the words no thanks written at the top
6301053 it was just a well organized and carefully planned grass roots campaign
6301054 we were determined to make wal mart uncomfortable because by making them uncomfortable we thought they would eventually leave
6301055 were very strong believers that everything comes from the almighty
6301056 i think the almighty realized that for our children to grow up in a beautiful community for our traditions to be preserved we couldnt have a wal mart
6301057 s ome of the civilians were hacked to death by machetes and there were reports that some were used as human shields during the violent rampage

6301071 judge karas dismissal of this suit validates the districts position and we are very pleased by his action
6301072 the district remains focused on our efforts to clean repair and upgrade the sewer system to better serve our citizens and protect our environment and all of our communities
6301073 weve gone a long way to ameliorate the problems and we will continue to work hard to fix any problem in our system
6301074 i dont know what constitutes a sewer spill or a violation from what ive seen i dont know what the judge was thinking
6301075 the results will be after the next few storms whether sewer flows out or not

6301086 town supervisor christopher st lawrence is promoting a mix of residential and retail development at a former drive in theater in monsey the 22 acres was proposed as the site for a wal mart supercenter until two weeks ago when the developer pulled out citing ramapos concerns about traffic and sewage disposal
6301087 richard lipsky of the neighborhood retail alliance who represented monsey business owners in their opposition to wal mart said union jobs also had been preserved at the nearby pathmark supermarket
6301088 obviously whatever goes there should not attract a lot of traffic
6301089 or put a burden on route 59 or old nyack turnpike

6301091 all christians are called upon to be good financial stewards
6301092 it is important for christians to pay all their financial obligations sometimes they just need a little help
6301093 it is better to pay the debt than to not pay it all
6301094 it is a wonderful alternative to bankruptcy negotiating a lower interest rate is the main way debt consolidation services work this will help to reduce the amount of money due and make the debt more manageable
6301095 the organization includes a financial management program to ensure that the person doesnt get into problems again
6301096 only for those who are in a desperate situation and their only alternative is to not pay the money owed but if there is a way to pay the debt in its entirety a christian should do so
6301097 christians should not have gotten themselves into that much trouble in the first place
6301098 they must suffer the consequences of their actions then maybe they will learn a lesson about spending money that is not theirs
6301099 to eliminate or lower legitimate debts is the same as stealing

6301119 i like it when my photos help them realize there are beautiful things to photograph right outside our doors
6301120 maybe i dont need a 6 000 pound vehicle with a global positioning system in it to get to the grocery store
6301121 it impacts how we make our movies how movie theaters present our films and how audiences experience our films

6301123 the quality and creativity of where intel is headed is light years ahead of what weve seen anybody else doing
6301124 at the moment we have members of the community and local councillors trying to access information and that information simply isnt being provided
6301125 councillors who make requests for information are forced to wait for weeks and months for a response to their requests and many times when the response finally arrives it lacks detail or any relevant information
6301126 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
6301127 we want to start writing new songs and we are really excited about the direction we have planned

6301134 it wasnt the highest need area so we initially werent as focused on that
6301135 we definitely wanted to make the program citywide so this year we really expanded our outreach efforts to include all the boroughs

6301137 we usually start in march or april and just continue to build throughout the summer
6301138 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6301139 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6301140 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said
6301141 we cant ban a folk belief but we hope to change how it is practised to ease pollution and eventually to phase the habit out
6301142 burning paper money not only pollutes the air and affects peoples health but causes so many trees to be cut down
6301143 in the past we burnt several truckloads of paper money brought by our followers in ghost month the stoves cracked after burning non stop and the smoke was terrible
6301144 it is difficult to stop an age old custom but gradually our followers are accepting the change and use less paper money
6301145 we believe that if a person is sincere his or her prayers will be answered without such offerings

6301153 piece of me para video of the year no vma 08
6301154 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6301155 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6301156 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6301157 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6301158 i am so happy with my level of play today
6301159 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6301160 to celebrate the historic participation of young americans in this years election and in support of the candidacy of barack obama for president
6301161 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
6301162 do i really need this will i end up wasting this is this an extravagance i can live without
6301163 if there is anything picked up then they will contact the night patrol and they will immediately attend to it
6301164 the problem is the police station is just office hours manned
6301165 the community was really disturbed there is no police presence around after hours and thats when the problem started
6301166 curbing sly grogging is primarily the function of the police and they cannot get on top of it because their shifts at the most go to 11 oclock at night
6301167 we are turning to big brother to monitor people by cameras and it is a privacy issue that really needs to be discussed
6301168 i think most people would be very reluctant to open wide the juvenile records
6301169 its our responsibility to make sure the citizens in this state are safe
6301170 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6301171 arsenal is known for playing technical and skillful football and has a young but experienced squad
6301172 im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6301173 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and caliber will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honors this season
6301174 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6301175 generally the report shows weve made tremendous progress as compared to three years ago or even one year ago
6301176 when you add it all up theres a surprisingly high number of people still not housed
6301177 wonderful for new york city and i believe he had the foresight to see that
6301178 the planes are still in the air people are scared and are staying indoors
6301179 we think we have the right to decide on the presidency
6301180 we dont have a dollar figure on the cost of the damage this program has done but it is far more than the cost of eliminating it
6301181 the department has been cracking down on architects and engineers who abuse the program
6301182 an investor who sells stock short borrows shares from a brokerage house and sells them to another buyer proceeds from the sale go into the shorters account he must buy those shares back cover at some point in time and return them to the lender
6301183 this isnt against us its part of a new global game
6301184 the aircraft carrier to syria is supposed to show that russia has allies and that it wants access to the mediterranean israel as a western state is merely one player in this global realignment russia is signalling in the strongest possible way that it is willing to activate its old soviet military alliances
6301185 today russias interest is to show the us and the west that it is a superpower again its back in the mediterranean its telling the west you need us in this region and you need us to deal with iran this is happening because it senses that the west is weak
6301186 as far as assad is concerned his new found russian friends could provide a deterrent against a future attack on syria
6301187 pakistan has done problematic things without any connection to arms sales to india such as the proliferation of nuclear know how to iran which has been going on for many years
6301188 we know that the pakistani government was not completely in the dark over pakistani nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khans nuclear smuggling network in this sense pakistan has been maneuvering in a way that has harmed this area irrespective of the indian connection
6301189 my spirit shall not strive with man forever because he also is flesh nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years
6301190 the dozen brookhaven units had surged by 31 percent in value since 2006 even as the median price of condos in the area plummeted 54 percent
6301191 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6301192 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6301193 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6301194 if you are a parent who was sitting with your child as they were preparing the cao form you will be aware it was filled out in the midst of an economic downturn where doom and gloom projections in construction and the roll back of it in school initiatives by government are having an impact on the student
6301195 in a sense this swift response is an indicator of students interest in digital media consuming news instantaneously online and being more aware than ever of the economic context of their continuing education in the next few years
6301196 we are not seeing the result of that yet the full results are yet to come we are only seeing the early stages of this investment
6301197 this information should have been made available before the cao forms were filled out
6301198 ultimately the report will play an important role in the nsw liberals nationals consideration of the privatisation legislation the joint statement said

6301200 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6301201 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6301202 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6301203 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6301204 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6301205 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6301206 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6301207 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6301208 many people will walk in and out of your life but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart
6301209 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said

6301212 when i was a kid i won a medal from the herald tribune as the best junior gardener in the city
6301213 its framed and hanging in the principals office over at ps 18
6301214 unless theres a glitch were working for a very successful outcome
6301215 she said to me im very scared and i just want to go home
6301216 our system can inform transport managers if vehicles are idling which could be due to poor driver behaviour it calculates if a vehicle is going at under 2km per hour for a given time but takes into account traffic and the type of operation involved for example a waste management vehicle going through a housing estate using algorithms which concentrate on changes in longitude and latitude
6301217 an overdue service means more wear and tear on vehicles our system can alert staff and managers when a service is due for example after 40 000 miles have been driven regarding mileage it can show the routes drivers take and recognises when mileage is unnecessary or unauthorised it also uses fuel cards such as those from dci or topaz to match mileage with fuel expenditure so companies can better understand what the actual fuel cost is in terms of miles per gallon
6301218 its amazing to think a driver can be thrown the keys of a 120 000 transport unit after five minutes familiarisation training coupled with better technology can really improve fuel management and anything that can interface with can bus systems makes the job so much easier
6301219 there is huge interest among transporters in any technology that can make their vehicles more fuel efficient whether its something simple to do with human behaviour or high end chip technology as fuel and labour costs combined are an enormous outlay
6301220 fuel can account for around 20pc of total operating costs fuel prices are very volatile some stability has returned to the market in terms of fuel costs but it is likely to be several months before hauliers will see the benefits of this
6301221 since 2004 weve been working closely with large civil engineering and utilities companies which have quite unique challenges in terms of managing costs we developed a product and service to allow them to monitor activity and improve the efficiency of their mobile operations
6301222 by getting real time information as to the position of vehicles and crews companies can respond much faster to changes using a web based service to make instant decisions for example a water authority might have a civil engineering firm on contract which is required to respond to a burst pipe within half an hour of a call our devices ensure the vehicle thats closest to the incident can respond within the allocated time
6301223 were looking at a 20pc growth rate in sales in the uk this year with an outlook of 50pc growth there within three to five years towards the end of 2008 we will take a broader view examining opportunities in europe and the us
6301224 we think theres enormous potential to use it as a messaging service at festivals like oxegen and electric picnic so friends can broadcast to each other which tent their favourite dj will be performing in for example
6301225 its a friendlier way of communicating rather than having an email newsletter that gets tied up in junk mail for firms it is a good way of building brand awareness and because you can only send 140 characters at a time you get concise bursts of information to people rather than too much
6301226 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates
6301227 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged 10 times thats because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
6301228 everyone understands that as a business twitter needs to make money
6301229 in the same way that people are happy that google does search ads they want twitter to make money because they are fans of the system
6301230 in one survey i read recently users were asked would they pay for the service some 50pc of people said they would pay for it because it is useful but would want a guarantee there would be no outages thats a potential captive audience of 600 000 and twitter and any mobile operator worth its salt would be mad to ignore it
6301231 i think its actually fantastic that twitter is looking seriously at its business model and saying it cant afford to handle the sms volumes its an opportunity that cant be ignored
6301232 personally i use it as a fire hose i dont have time to send one message at a time to my friends and colleagues but this way i can keep everyone up to date i also use it to share and get knowledge around 25pc of my tweets are hyperlinked to other sites i have about 1 700 followers and more of them read my tweets than my actual blog
6301233 effectively twitter allows me to gain knowledge at a faster rate than if i was just visiting websites or reading blogs
6301234 esfuerzos estadounidenses por cambiar el equilibrio estrat gico en su favor
6301235 los misiles interceptores de largo alcance que van a ser desplegados en polonia no tienen y no van a tener en el futuro previsible ning n otro blanco que los misiles bal sticos intercontinentales de rusia
6301236 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6301237 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6301238 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6301239 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic

6301245 i made one phone call to say we need this and we need that and i got six more staff to help
6301246 they understand the urgency of this reform effort we wanted to get the best people possible
6301247 i saw it as a particular challenge at markham middle school which used to be one of the best most highly touted schools in l a unified
6301248 the vast majority of our administrators would love to spend three hours in classes but the reality of the situation mitigates that
6301249 we are all instructional leaders you have to be in place half your day should be in the classroom
6301250 l a unified is very very large and school sites cant get the services that they need
6301251 i needed to make some decisions yesterday and i got the support
6301252 we already know the negatives the unknown is how well we can do
6301253 it could be theyre concerned about the change in focus or direction
6301254 it could be theyre concerned about the relationship and subordination to the mayors control it could be they prefer to be in a different environment
6301255 they allowed the principals and assistant principals to stay if they wished
6301256 everyone wants to know what its going to look like

6301261 mcus play an instrumental role in accelerating electronic innovations in automotives by making the vehicle lighter and more efficient and drivers more informed
6301262 increasing complexity in automotive electronics is amplifying the need for higher performance 32 bit mcus with more embedded memory
6301263 using more electronics in vehicles plays a critical role and mcus inside these electronics provide higher precision control and on demand capability leading to considerable improvement in fuel efficiencyand a reduction in emissions
6301264 with increasingly stringent emission regulations and higher gasoline prices the automotive industry is making strides toward cleaner emissions and better fuel economy
6301265 in the next decade we will see an accelerated adoption of fuel efficient technologies in all cars worldwide additionally we expect the revolutionary zero emission and alternative fuel solutions to be commercialised after 2015 all of these innovations will rely heavily on electronic control systems and therefore mcus

6301267 el proyecto que presentar este fin de semana el frente amplio progresista combatir la corrupci n en pemex y en el gobierno que es el principal problema no solo de pemex sino del pa s la deshonestidad imperante
6301268 yo avalo y apoyo esa propuesta de t cnicos expertos e intelectuales
6301269 no yo hasta aqu recibo la propuesta estuvieron los legisladores ellos van a hacer ya lo que corresponde
6301270 para organizarnos bien y no permitir ninguna imposici n de parte de las c pulas del pri y del pan que no quieran imponer una iniciativa privatizadora que entregue el petr leo a particulares y extranjeros
6301271 este presupuesto 2009 es muy importante estoy seguro que nuestros adversarios echar n mano de todos los recursos a su alcance para usarlos electoralmente
6301272 por eso tenemos que ponerle diques controles f rreos mayores instrumentos de fiscalizaci n para evitar el uso abusivo y el lucro pol tico de los programas p blicos especialmente los sociales destinados al campo sin afectar el ejercicio eficiente del gasto
6301273 ha habido correspondencia y actitud de responsabilidad por m xico en el an lisis legislativo ahora les toca a ellos no ser incompetentes es un problema de eficacia no permitiremos que se distraiga con falsos debates cuando es una preocupaci n que afecta a todo el pa s
6301274 el pa s se encuentra en un estado de emergencia por quienes lucran con la impunidad a todos nos preocupa la estrategia ineficaz para combatir al crimen organizado que el gobierno no ha podido corregir
6301275 la inserci n de un cintillo que se ala o que contiene la frase de presidente leg timo en este contexto y en esta propaganda pol tica no resulta denigrante ni en s misma ni en su contexto a la instituci n de la presidencia de la rep blica y no hay lesi n a instituci n alguna
6301276 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6301277 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6301278 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said
6301279 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6301280 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6301281 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6301282 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6301283 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet
6301284 we are working closely to render assistance and support needed to secure the release of the ship and crew

6301297 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6301298 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6301299 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6301300 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6301301 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6301302 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6301303 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6301304 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6301305 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6301308 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6301309 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6301310 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6301311 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6301312 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6301313 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message

6301326 we said how about if one of our staff sees a photographer on the street bearing in mind that they are professional card carriers and asked for five minute chat and said would you mind not using that one or at least pixellate my face we are in no position legally or morally to start making demands but there are welfare and safety issues and to be fair the photographers here understood that the police will be issuing guidelines to picture desks across all london papers soon nigel howard an evening standard photographer with 12 years experience was at the meeting and saw the agreement as a step forward in press police relations they don t have a great issue with being photographed they just want us to obscure their faces and we are quite prepared to do that he said police have been a little obstructive when we wish to take pictures at armed incidents but i am now pleased to say that after discussions a new way forward has been worked out for a better relationship howard said there could still a problem when citizen journalists take pictures of crime scenes using mobile phones but he admitted there was little either side could do about it relations between photographers and police were better he said after the signing of behaviour guidelines between journalists and the met last year the difficulty is that there has been a problem getting the message across to every officer

6301378 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6301379 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6301380 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6301381 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6301382 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6301383 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6301384 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6301385 they want to know what were going to do about it

6301394 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6301395 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6301396 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6301397 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6301398 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6301399 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6301400 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6301401 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6301402 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6301403 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6301404 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6301405 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6301406 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable

6301416 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6301417 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6301418 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6301419 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me

6301434 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
6301435 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
6301436 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
6301437 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
6301438 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
6301439 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
6301440 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

6301446 i told the proponents that the bill simply wasnt ever going to get through as long as there was suspicion that it was a back door way to get at roe v wade or criminalize abortion in illinois
6301447 i told the proponents just give us some extra language that will establish a comfort level for the pro choice community
6301448 they said it wasnt acceptable they said the feds didnt need those kinds of words why did we need it
6301449 it wasnt necessary the bill would have passed without it pro abort legislators needed a reason to support it in the face of mounting pressure and added those 2 redundancies to save face

6301453 given that the bottom line is that the bill has only passed when its critics are satisfied that its utterly meaningless this doesnt seem like a particularly substantive debate over whether or not he wants to kill living infants
6301454 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6301455 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6301456 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6301457 it is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men

6301465 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6301466 the response rate for the poll was 31 over a three day field period because of the unique method of collecting data for this poll the response rate is not comparable to those of telephone based polls

6301485 emas ini telah menyadarkanku akan kehidupan lain kini aku memutuskan untuk kembali ke asalku aku akan menjadi cewek yang feminim meski aku ada di cabang olahraga yang keras
6301486 bahkan aku tak pernah memiliki satu helai rok pun apalagi gaun malam yang paling aneh adalah aku nyaris tak memiliki bentuk payudara seperti halnya remaja normal lainnya
6301487 aku sempat minder dan tak percaya kalau aku nyaris tak memiliki itu tapi kini aku sudah siap menjadi cewek beneran karena semua yang ada pada diriku bisa aku banggakan termasuk tubuhku yang proporsional kata orang
6301488 itu sudah jadi komitmenku dan semua orang mendukungku termasuk orang tua dan kekasihku
6301489 aku telah menunggu lama untuk saat seperti ini aku sangat senang sekarang dan aku ingin berterima kasih pada semua orang yang telah membantuku selama ini
6301490 aku belajar banyak darinya terutama di sektor teknik tendangan ke arah kepala
6301491 aku sangat senang dan ingin merayakan ini dengan semua rekan rekan dekatku terima kasih untuk semua
6301492 aku memang seorang pelari dan teknik dasar pelari tentu kecepatan menyiapkan kaki sebagai penopang dan itu aku pelajari saat aku berusia 12 tahun sebelum aku mengenal taekwondo secara mendalam
6301493 saat itu aku benar benar tak tahu apa yang harus kukerjakan semuanya sudah kulakukan apa kata pelatih sudah kukerjakan tapi ternyata hasilnya tetap nihil aku tak pernah mendapat juara
6301494 sekitar dua tahun lalu aku merasakan itu semua meski sebenarnya motivasiku tak 100 persen lagi
6301495 no te puedo ver por qu hace mucho tiempo que no nos frecuentamos
6301496 mainstreaming the fact that major sports events need a large place online because there is an audience for it and there are ad dollars for it
6301497 the type of content were producing appeals to the casual fan
6301498 seeing the events live appeals more to the fans who are passionate about a particular sport
6301499 if programmers understand that people will watch different programs on different platforms we can stop playing the game of trying to replace tv
6301500 events look great on hdtvs whether they are sports shows or movies quick hits and short clips are great for the internet
6301501 the quality of the video from the olympics through silverlight has been some of the best online streaming content yet
6301502 gray was involved in stealing oil from the crews lease in wilbarger county and delivering it to the receiving station with a fraudulent manifest
6301503 im still not over it yet maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
6301504 saya merasa seperti ditampar ketika dia mengambil kaus dan menandatanganinya dia tenang tenang saja denagn tindakan itu

6301506 one of our board members called at 6 a m to tell me we better get the vans out of harrell park
6301507 but we learned our lessons last year this time we got things up much higher
6301508 we were better safe than sorry all we got was a little bit of water in some lower kitchen cabinets
6301509 we got water up to the door of the general store that most people remember from electricritters but luckily it didnt cover the floor

6301513 capitol briefing apologizes for the error and will be more careful as he continues to report this story
6301514 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6301515 now go out there and show em what youve got
6301516 because in some places there are nude beaches where people can go swimming without any clothes
6301517 wir sind am montag fast 80 runden gefahren konnten dabei eine menge ausprobieren und viele reifen von dunlop testen
6301518 mit der basiseinstellung sind wir sehr weit gekommen das gibt uns viel zuversicht f r den misano grand prix der in zwei wochen stattfindet nach dem sturz im rennen hat mich der test wirklich aufgestellt

6301520 the plan is to open a restaurant there but its not going to be another taste of thai for sure
6301521 its going to be something different something unique that doesnt exist in harrisonburg yet a different kind of food with asian flair and beyond
6301522 so for a good while it sat unused until the city and property owners and contractors got on the same page
6301523 once it was fixed there was a lot of interest in the building
6301524 as soon as the bridge work was completed we had the same number of calls on that building within two weeks that we did in the six or seven months before that
6301525 i think people liked it because it was a proven restaurant location spankys was successful there for a long time and people know they can make money there
6301526 this project is not one where they wash the windows sweep the floors and open up
6301527 even though that building used to be a restaurant its been there so long and everything is so old that weve got to do major upgrades
6301528 the spankys building came up and the location was just perfect right across from the parking garage
6301529 when we took a look at it once the bridge was finished we thought wow it looks totally different
6301530 didnt know that tr thanks for the heads up spitz
6301531 i think hes more of a tool rather than a
6301532 that cracked us up in my sports magazine office today
6301533 i think shes unoficially holds the title of hottest girl woman
6301534 that young man is a physical specimen he seems to embody what you want in a young athlete so the story is not just for gator fans but for everyone to get to know him
6301535 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6301536 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6301537 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6301538 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6301539 the great thing about it was when heath died those three actors came along and saved the day its now four actors creating one character the three actors were totally heroic coming in because this doesnt happen very often where there is a tragedy and very famous and successful actors come in and say ok well do whatever it takes to help to be part of that is wonderful
6301540 the ceo of the nmf mr achmat dangor has confirmed that there is no such person or position at the foundation
6301541 duh this place is pretty different than what im used to
6301542 the feeling of the majority was that the bill still created great uncertainty about whether it would compromise abortion rights
6301543 let them demonstrate what powers they have ceded to the prime minister or to the other party identify those areas and you will easily see who the stumbling block is

6301548 leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it
6301549 thats fine the next time we go camping you make the reservations
6301550 how come you never tell me what you want to do
6301551 what is the difference between a middle aged man and a backpack of cement
6301552 whatever concerns anyone may have had that this might become some clever way to undermine the rights protected under roe v wade have i think been addressed
6301553 unless someone attempts to disrupt this effort by dragging the abortion debate back into it i have little doubt that it will be passed without much controversy
6301554 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
6301555 i told the proponents that the bill simply wasnt ever going to get through as long as there was suspicion that it was a back door way to get at roe v wade or criminalize abortion in illinois
6301556 i told the proponents just give us some extra language that will establish a comfort level for the pro choice community
6301557 they said it wasnt acceptable they said the feds didnt need those kinds of words why did we need it
6301558 it wasnt necessary the bill would have passed without it pro abort legislators needed a reason to support it in the face of mounting pressure and added those 2 redundancies to save face
6301559 obama held born alive on march 6 2003 from even being voted on in committee it is also important to note from the docket that on march 13 2003 obama stopped the senate sponsor from adding the lately discussed clarification paragraph from the federal baipa to make the bills absolutely identical
6301560 obama as chairman of the committee that vetted illinois version in 2003 refused to allow an amendment rendering both concluding paragraphs identical he also refused to call the bill and killed it
6301561 illinois prosecutors and officials with the ill dept of public health are hereby enjoined from initiating any prosecution including but not limited to criminal proceedings or imposing any sanction for violation of or enforcing in any way any of certain defined the provisions of the illinois abortion law of 1975 against any physician offering or performing abortions or pregnancy terminations

6301563 every one of those three bouts were tough i was actually fighting every 15 minutes i was tired my opponents were also tired but i was confident of winning a medal through the repechage we had very good preparation maybe you were not that sure
6301564 if we get support like the athletes of leading counries like the u s belarus and russia we can also get gold medals there is no dearth of talent in the country
6301565 once i lost that first bout i knew that i would be out if i lost a match i was very keen and decided that i would keep fighting till the end
6301566 it was a tough decision but this is something that i have always wanted to do
6301567 at quan sports marketing we will work with various teams on a wide range of duties and eventually focus on a core business that will help athletes with their charitable events and foundations

6301569 we think thats a tremendous shame because we see that as our role to get those exhibitions but they are very expensive and that is where some of the cuts would come
6301570 theyre not going to be stopped altogether well just do them in other years one or two at a time
6301571 even setting aside the efficiency dividend the costs have increased more than 50 per cent in the last four years of activity to the level now where weve taken a decision to reduce the quality of collecting in that area
6301572 our electricity bill would be 500 000 this year with no appropriation to make up for that
6301573 you cant show the collection in darkness and you cant turn off the air conditioning to preserve a 3 3 billion collection
6301574 people would be horrified if a painting or some relic were stolen and it turned out there was one person on duty or something like that
6301575 if you go to archives for example and wish to get some information you were charged a fee and some fee is reasonable but the pressure on those agencies is to increase those fees
6301576 and the war memorial presumably will be under some sort of pressure to charge fees for additional services
6301577 but to be perfectly honest weve had this arrangement efficiency dividends now for over 20 years
6301578 we felt like warriors out there the pressure of playing china made it pretty intense
6301579 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6301580 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy

6301589 i need those kind of matches under my belt its good for my confidence
6301590 i had to dig deep if i can get through those kind of matches i can get through anything
6301591 the thing im most proud of this year is that ive remained consistent throughout
6301592 my goal was to break the top 50 ive done that the rest of the year is bonus for me

6301606 ive trained really hard if theres something unsafe to do i wouldnt attempt it
6301607 its much harder when we add the psychological aspect to it making it more taxing physically and emotionally

6301613 they didnt have any they said its too graphic they said my wife is too graphic because shes paralyzed
6301614 i lost my best friend last year in a car accident and i saw her in that vegetative state a week before she died and it was really offending i actually had to end up leaving work early because i couldnt handle it
6301615 i dont think theres a movie that ive been on that i wasnt sure i could direct it better
6301616 well im not going to pay money so why not
6301617 we are very confident in our ability to compete in a different space than middle east producers
6301618 a big part of our strategy is to codevelop specialty products with end market users in china
6301619 lee will be in charge of the china project as well as codevelopment of new products with customers
6301620 we are sending our head of r amp d and not an engineer to build this business this is a very different approach and we will aim to meet customer requirements earlier than they expect
6301621 the middle east will supply a huge amount of commodity polymers in 2009 but this wont matter so much in the specialty space
6301622 we want to compete in an area based on codeveloping specialty polymers with customers and meeting their requirements earlier than they expect

6301626 the escorting of the hearers into the presence of god for the purpose of transformation
6301627 the function of the exegetical escort is to embrace the text of scripture in order to usher the hearer into the presence of god for the purpose of transformation
6301628 the purpose of the preacher as a doxological dancer is to communicate the doctrinal message of the bible with accuracy and ardor so that the exuberant hearer exults in the exaltation of god
6301629 preachers who preach doctrinally must put their ears to the pavement of the text and synchronize the heartbeat of the text with the heartbeat of the doctrine of the authors intent
6301630 the authorial intention must be gleaned because a text can never mean today what it never meant when it was written
6301631 t hey must always return to the pulsating heartbeat of the texts

6301652 but that could be dangerous for the whale because if it doesnt find a lactating female its just out there on its own and theres all sorts of sharks out there
6301653 we dont want to be stressing the whale out by whatever we choose to do
6301654 the thing thats coming home to us is whatever reason that caused the mother to abandon it may be the same reason causing other pods to reject it
6301655 until then the advice we have is that unless something miraculous happens like the mother whale turning up its looking bleak
6301656 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6301657 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6301658 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales
6301659 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
6301660 we must try to save this baby whale to do nothing is not an option we are happy to build a tourism industry around these beautiful creatures and now the time has come to pay it forward
6301661 something needs to be done the poor thing is asking for help at least try wrote kanaia
6301662 the most humane thing though it is a terribly sad thing would be to put it down there is no point in prolonging its suffering in the foolish and arrogant presumption that we could save its life

6301681 burning paper money not only pollutes the air and affects peoples health but causes so many trees to be cut down
6301682 in the past we burnt several truckloads of paper money brought by our followers in ghost month the stoves cracked after burning non stop and the smoke was terrible
6301683 it is difficult to stop an age old custom but gradually our followers are accepting the change and use less paper money
6301684 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6301685 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy

6301703 the iraqi government and the u s now are able to shift focus from mainly combat to mainly building the fragile beginnings of peace a transition that many found almost unthinkable as recently as one year ago
6301704 organized resistance with the steady drumbeat of bombings kidnappings assassinations and ambushes that once rocked the capital daily has all but ceased
6301705 my expectation is that were going to present a clear choice to iran change your behavior and you will be fully integrated into the international community with all the benefits that go with that continue your illicit nuclear program and the international community as a whole will ratchet up pressure with stronger and increased sanctions
6301706 we are perhaps unintentionally legitimating the idea of the use of force
6301707 the real option is to keep negotiating be very tough on the sanctions adopt more sanctions make it more painful for the iranians
6301708 on the u s side there has been a recognition that our sanctions which have been in place for thirteen years and have increased in severity over that time have not in fact stopped iran from building centrifuges and expanding its nuclear capability
6301709 ultimately the report will play an important role in the nsw liberals nationals consideration of the privatisation legislation the joint statement said

6301717 saddam supported groups that either associated directly with al qaeda such as the egyptian islamic jihad led at one time by bin ladens deputy ayman al zawahiri or that generally shared al qaedas stated goals and objectives
6301718 with an infrastructure supporting 1 his own particular brand of state terrorism against internal and external threats 2 the state sponsorship of suicide operations and 3 organizational relationships and outreach programs for terrorist groups
6301719 evidence that was uncovered and analyzed attests to the existence of a terrorist capability and a willingness to use it until the day saddam was forced to flee iraq as part of the global war on terrorism launched by the after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001

6301723 that america disagrees with the rest of the world over dealing with the middle east and radical islam
6301724 a nation in danger of collapse the west needs to come to grips with the realization that turkey like iraq is not and can never be a democracy and any efforts to establish a democracy in these regions will prove fatal since democracy like the attempts in iraq will only be used for electing an islamic sharia driven system

6301736 threat spy allows the public to take a step away from the volumes of data showing the increasing dangers of the web and actually see the malware being blocked every day in different places around the world
6301737 we reported a 278 percent increase in malware in the first half of 2008 and this innovative map visualizes this worrying increase we hope the map will demonstrate how dangerous the threat landscape is and will prompt companies to take action
6301738 the web 2 0 environment is a dynamic one and we wanted to provide an equally dynamic map of the threats confronting todays web surfers
6301739 the beauty of threat spy is that it captures up to date detailed information on threats shortly after they are blocked this not only provides timely insight into existing new and emerging web based threats it also helps demonstrate the critical importance of real time web scanning
6301740 we are very interested in this offer because the intelligent social animals imprisoned at seaworld are

6301755 while microsoft has always been active in licence audits our recent membership survey also found that audits from adobe are on the increase and symantec have also started performing audits in the last 12 months
6301756 however the threat of hefty fines or embarrassment from a corporate reputation perspective shouldnt be the sole driver for compliance research shows that 41 percent of businesses are in fact currently over licensed which means there are significant cost savings to be gained from accurately understanding and managing your licensing position fast is here to raise awareness and help organisations become more proactive in their licence management and compliance
6301757 audits are very disruptive and the ramifications if an organisation isnt licence compliant can be significant
6301758 unfortunately many organisations still fail to prioritise software asset management preferring to take the risk rather than manage their licence positions properly senior management must take heed and prioritise compliance as a necessary business process

6301785 a change of routine was that she had changed to where she would take her son to one place and then her daughter then she would be taking her to another place but after taking her son evidently she just went into routine mode and started thinking about her work here

6301813 each tube of gc 1 thermal compound contains 5 grams of paste in a pretty standard tube as we just mentioned and as a rather nice addition to the package an applicator for the compound is also provided to help spread it over whatever surface you are applying it to speaking of applying this thermal compound it really couldnt be easier the paste itself is just the right consistency to make applying the correct amount simple and spreading it via the included applicator ensures that being left with a thin and even layer of thermal compound is simplicity itself with this in mind this gc 1 thermal compound is easily one of the best weve tested as far as actual application of the paste goes
6301814 the real problem with code of honor 2 isnt the bad graphics though those are the first thing anyone will notice poor graphics we can cope with not every game has to have huge polygon counts and procedurally generated dynamic mega texture awesomeness but good games do have to have something they have to have a hook that can draw people in and make them want to play more code of honor 2 doesnt have that utterly boring and bland and far too easy in the singleplayer game a quarter baked and shallow experience on the multiplayer side code of honor doesnt really do anything right and is doomed to soon reside in the bargain bin there are two type of games to find in bargain bins though there are old or unappreciated games that are still very much worth playing and then theres stuff that just couldnt survive in a capitalist market due to a stunning lack of worth if youve read the review this far and still cant figure out which one we think code of honor 2 is then this is probably the game for you
6301815 cyber snipas sonar 5 1 design is somewhat funky it has these flame red ear cups and the rest of the design is all black it has the same styling as the cyber snipa stinger mouse we reviewed a while back its like razer using their neon green and black theme cyber does it the other way round and uses hot rod red to fire things up a bit these headphones have a bunch of neat features for starters their 5 1 surround this means you could actually make out the difference between an enemy sneaking up behind on your or watch your dvds with all the sound effects and rumble yes thats right this headset what cyber snipa likes to call force feedback built inside

6301825 there have been no confirmed illnesses associated with the consumption of these products
6301826 a number of the affected products are part of a listeriosis outbreak investigation
6301827 a small number of sure slice packaged meat products produced at the companys bartor road toronto facility predominantly for foodservice customers have tested positive to contain low levels of listeria monocytogenes
6301828 in july 2008 routine surveillance conducted by the ministry detected a marked increase in cases of listeriosis being reported by ontario health units
6301829 as of yesterday there have been 29 cases associated with the outbreak across 17 health units of these 13 are confirmed cases and the rest are probable and suspect cases which are under investigation by the local health units outbreak associated cases of listeriosis have also been reported in british columbia saskatchewan and quebec ontario is working with the public health agency of canada and the other provinces in the investigation
6301830 first they have the same strain as the outbreak strain that has been identified in ontario and second they have been exposed to the foods that are under recall it does seem that they are linked
6301831 thats not to say that a small butcher cant make mistakes but at best hes going to kill off a few of his neighbours when you take that same mistake and you put it into a plant that serves millions the risk is vastly expanded
6301832 although the risk of listeriosis associated with foods from deli counters such as sliced packaged meat and poultry products is relatively low pregnant women and immunosuppressed persons may choose to avoid these foods

6301890 ik studeerde economie in tbilisi de georgische hoofdstad cd en moest een tijdje naar brussel voor een internationaal congres in mijn thuisland speelde ik rugby en uit nieuwsgierigheid heb ik eens uitgezocht of ik hier geen goede rugbyploeg kon vinden en ja niet zo heel lang daarna speelde ik voor watermaal bosvoorde en besloot ik hier in belgi te blijven
6301891 ik werd hier ontzettend warm verwelkomd en ik heb dan ook heel goede herinneringen aan die perio de
6301892 wat me aan brussel direct opviel was de enorme waaier aan culturen en de internationale uitstraling alhoewel ik voor mijn sport vaak naar frankrijk moet breng ik mijn vrije tijd het liefst hier door ik ben nu bezig met mijn definitieve regularisatie want ik kan natuurlijk niet voor de natio nale ploeg blijven spelen met een gewone verblijfsvergunning
6301893 het is ronduit bevreemdend om zoiets mee te maken zeker als je nog familie hebt in georgi oorlog is echt niet de weg die we willen bewandelen op weg naar een lidmaatschap van de europese unie ik vind het alleszins fair dat de media hier het conflict volgen omdat het een europees land is dat wordt aangevallen maar de oorlog moet stoppen geschillen tussen georgi en rusland kunnen niet op deze manier beslecht worden we leven in de eenentwintigste eeuw
6301894 rusland doet nog altijd zoals het altijd heeft gedaan gebieden proberen in te lijven of te controleren
6301895 ik heb zelfs even overwogen om naar geor gi te vliegen om het leger te gaan versterken maar achteraf gezien weet ik dat dat een stom idee was ik zou ook veel op het spel zetten mijn studie politieke en sociale wetenschappen aan de ulb mijn vriendenkring en mijn leven hier wel heb ik het gevoel dat we hier niet veel tegen het conflict kunnen beginnen ik geloof overigens ook niet dat georgi dit conflict begonnen is zeg nu zelf een gigant als rusland aanvallen daarvoor moet je toch stom zijn we willen bij de europese unie en bij de navo horen dan ga je dat toch niet doen maar nu weten we tenminste zeker waarom we erbij willen horen rusland zou maar eens moeten durven een navo land aan te vallen
6301896 wat me altijd aan georgi is bijgebleven is de enorme druk die op ons werd gelegd tijdens onze schoolperiode je moet weten dat we er als klein land baat bij hebben onze oorsprong en de geschiedenis van ons land grondig aan kinderen te onderwijzen dat nationaliteitsgevoel heeft ons al vaak geholpen zonder zouden we waarschijnlijk zelf geschiedenis geworden zijn maar ik merk nu pas bij mezelf hoe zoiets op mensen weegt hoe dit een persoonlijkheid kan be nvloeden ik ben georgische dat is er gewoon in geramd
6301897 in belgi bestaat zoiets niet aanvankelijk vond ik brussel dan ook maar niets maar na tien jaar heb ik me daaraan aangepast deze serene maar toch open stad met een gebrek aan karakter maar met mogelijkheden zat is nu mijn thuis geworden al zou ik het toch moeilijk hebben als ik gedwongen werd te kiezen tussen brussel en georgi mijn intellectue le leven speelt zich hier af
6301898 er waren veel georgi rs die de sovjet elite versterkt hebben en dan heb ik het nog niet over stalin die ook uit georgi kwam dankzij dat hebben we altijd onze onafhankelijkheid en onze eigenheid kunnen bewaren binnen die unie maar ja we vormden er dan ook de grens van h wat nu gebeurt is min of meer hetzelfde
6301899 omdat ons land op een geostrategisch kruispunt ligt heeft rusland na het einde van de sovjet unie steeds afwisselend geprobeerd de volkeren in de kaukasus te verdelen en te paaien telkens met als doel er voet aan de grond te houden waarom wel als de regio te onstabiel is moet de olie uit azi wel via rusland naar europa gevoerd worden en daar gaat het eigenlijk om niet om die kleine gebiedjes die door de russen gesteund worden in hun onafhankelijkheidsstreven de inzet is veel hoger het gaat over de hele regio en het is en blijft een probleem van de hele regio en bij uitbreiding een probleem van de grootmachten in deze wereld alleen zien die dat niet doet dit alles je nu niet aan de koude oorlog denken
6301900 ik ben nogal cynisch aangelegd soms vraag ik me af of veel belgen of europeanen er berhaupt van wakker liggen ik merk wel dat ik steun krijg van mijn belgische vrienden maar daarbuiten merk ik vooral onverschilligheid toch blijf ik het gevoel hebben dat ik mensen moet wakker schudden al is het alleen maar omdat het het enige is wat ik hier in brussel kan doen
6301901 this is truly an option of last resort which has to be preceded by many other moves i am confident that the market arrangements will be enough to ensure that prices develop in a normal fashion

6301907 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6301934 until this study was published scientists generally believed that when people experience stress they trigger a hormonal cascade that revs the body to either stand and fight or flee as fast as possible
6301935 its an ancient survival mechanism left over from the time we were chased across the planet by saber toothed tigers
6301936 it seems that when the hormone oxytocin is released as part of the stress responses in a woman it buffers the

6301957 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6301958 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6301959 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6301960 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6301961 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6301962 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6301963 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6301964 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6302019 jag har varit mer pessimistisk n de flesta prognosmakare vi har l nge haft en prognos p under 2 procents tillv xt i r och det r d r som vriga prognosmakare nu hamnar n r de justerar ned sina prognoser det kommer inte g s rskilt bra f r sverige men det kommer inte heller g s rskilt d ligt
6302020 det r egentligen tre faktorer som gjorde mig negativ f rutom bol nekrisen i usa och de stigande oljepriserna s har b de finans och penningpolitiken varit v ldigt restriktiv i sverige och det r egentligen det som g r att sverige har en s mre bnp tillv xt n usa vilket ju kan k nnas lite or ttvist de stora skillnaden r att i usa har man haft en penning och finanspolitik som har motverkat l gkonjunkturen medan vi i sverige snarast f rst rkt den
6302021 men n r det g ller finanspolitiken hade regeringen redan i r kunnat vara mycket mer expansiv de 30 miljarder kronor som regeringen ska satsa n sta r borde ha kommit i r n sta r borde de satsa nnu mer s g ytterligare 40 miljarder kronor penningpolitiken r knepigare eftersom det f rutom l gre r ntor ven beh vs en signal till alla som vill h ja sina priser och l ner att det inte g r f r sig i det h r l get
6302022 ja och ven utan utf rs ljningspengarna s r verskottet i r 100 miljarder kronor jag tycker att riksrevisionens ganska h rda kritik om hur regeringen f rs ker tricksa bort verskottet i st llet f r att ge oss en plan hur man ska ta ned verskottet till m let 1 procent av bnp r ber ttigad
6302023 jag tycker i och f r sig att f rslagen med jobbskatte avdrag satsningen p infrastruktur och forskning och utveckling r bra men d ru t ver beh ver vi skattes nkningar som kar efterfr gan p arbetskraft det g ller s rskilt i det h r konjunkturl get jag tror det vore bra att s nka f retagsskatterna till tminstone samma niv som europa har det r framf r allt de kvarvarande delarna av 3 12 reglerna som g r att f retagarna fortfarande betalar mycket i skatt det vill s ga att mycket av f retagarnas vinster beskattas som l n i st llet f r kapital
6302024 om man minskar en del f retagsskatter kan man f renkla administrationen och d f rsvinner mycket utrymme f r skattefusk men n r skatteverket p st r att sm f retagen fuskar mycket med sin skatt s r det en bluffutredning eftersom det de grundar p st endet p r privatpersoner som svartarbetar och d rf r enligt skatteverket borde ha registrerat ett f retag i den situationen kallar skatteverket dem f retagare och hamnar s att s ga i utredningen
6302025 ja det tycker jag absolut den r men kar man med 30 miljarder kronor i r vilket de borde ha gjort och med ytterligare 40 miljarder kronor n sta r s blir det 70 miljarder kronor och det r en rimlig stimulans
6302026 ja i sin utformning har finanspolitiken motverkat sitt l fte om regel f renkling d r tycker jag att finansdepartementet har varit alldeles f r kamrersm ssigt de borde f resl enklare l sningar p problemen
6302027 i grunden tror jag det beror p att regeringen inte har prioriterat n ringspolitiken utan att man har gett finansdepartementets synpunkter f r stort utrymme om man skulle lyfta upp n ringspolitiken som ett av det viktigaste departementet skulle det komma fram enklare och mer n ringslivsv nliga f rslag

6302067 this show offers a chance for people to discover or rediscover these plants
6302068 many of the plants youll see were kept alive by one backyard gardener
6302069 in the case of the moon and stars watermelon someone found one person somewhere in missouri who was still growing it
6302070 we will have seeds from the previous year for sale
6302071 seeds collected from this years plants wont be dry until december but the great thing about this show is the contacts visitors can meet the people growing these plants ask them questions and order seeds from them
6302072 we have approximately 45 000 to 50 000 people every year thats of course weather dependent
6302073 its basically a block party we have a lot of activities
6302074 it seems most parents were extremely happy with the process today
6302075 some of these kids are living with their grandma or grandpa or family friend just to go school in our district
6302076 they should think about doing this every two years instead of annually
6302077 but this a good thing i dont think we should be paying to educate kids who dont live in the district
6302078 its always been good for me over the years ive done quite well there
6302079 by offering jewelry and crafters that are accessible to regular people we figure most people that attend an art show are not coming to buy a large painting but they can afford smaller pieces
6302080 last year four days before the event we had all these rains that caused all that flooding
6302081 that was an absolute blessing because that was a perfect venue for the event
6302082 theyve already determined that my boats going to be the first one to sink
6302083 it ought to be a pretty ugly boat well probably wear life jackets
6302084 a phenomenal august great art great taste celebration on the north shore
6302085 its always been good for me over the years ive done quite well there
6302086 our staff is amazing so we dont necessarily need someone in parks and recreation
6302087 we have that we have the experts in that we need someone who is going to help and lead and deal with the seven person board and elected officials and get out there and do his thing
6302088 you either have it or you dont and id like to think i have the skills i think would be positive for the park board
6302089 working in naperville over 20 years i know the city certainly know people by first name and could hit the ground running and could step up and get things done and mend fences perceived to be broken
6302090 we have to become creative and tighten our belt here but we also have to meet the demands of our customers
6302091 am i a messiah absolutely not is there a lot of work ahead of me yes but i like my odds based on past successes ive had and looking at whats in place currently
6302092 as a leader or a manager of an organization if you are not creating future leaders creating people and molding people to take your position you arent a leader
6302093 id like to think if i leave here the decision will be easy for the village board to pluck someone else from within and put them in this chair
6302094 its an unusual career twist but ive had three or four different careers in my life so if it makes sense to him and to the park district then go for it
6302095 hes a good police chief and i would hate to see him go but wish him well
6302096 im supposed to feel relieved and i do a little bit
6302097 but im still troubled that this ever happened we deserve the right to express an opinion without being dragged into the legal system having been led away from my home in handcuffs after doing nothing wrong still burns a bit
6302098 thats why we went forward with the complaint i respect every persons first amendment right i dont think we should ever take any steps to curtail that this had only to do with traffic safety on a highway
6302099 you cant yell fire in a crowd and you cant hang a very large display over a highway like that its just unsafe
6302100 i took this case because i felt what happened to them was wrong
6302101 that is when martha cut me from behind with a knife
6302102 she cut my neck and stabbed me in the shoulder and in my stomach i yelled for help and people started coming out i escaped and started running toward the buildings
6302103 i tried to help martha and in return i have suffered greatly
6302104 i wish to be there for my daughter while she still is a child to help her and guide her so she doesnt make the same bad decisions i have made
6302105 i myself come from a family of alcoholics and addicts and i dont want her to fall victim to this horrible disease but to break the cycle so she doesnt have to have the life that i have lived
6302106 priority repairs have been completed except the band orchestra area
6302107 we are trying to bring the structure back to the original design or as close as possible
6302108 typically for this type of construction you are looking at a 30 40 50 year service life and often times it exceeds that
6302109 the simple answer will be 50 years but buildings can last for a long time provided that they remain functional
6302110 obviously there were some things that were not identified in those inspections
6302111 i cant come out and say that we have looked at everything
6302112 there are some things that are hidden within walls if there is no reason to believe there is a problem there are some things that arent really feasible without destroying the school we have looked at all areas of the masonry walls every stone hasnt been turned
6302113 the district is funding this we hope to recapture these funds through litigation
6302114 i just grabbed the car keys i just got the car for my son and they were going to tow it
6302115 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6302116 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6302117 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6302118 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6302119 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6302120 someday when this building is 85 years old and you are about 90 youll look back and say i was there on the very first day it opened
6302121 teachers move those classes you know how to do it
6302122 i cant pick one thing its so beautiful its so spacious
6302123 this is just over the top beautiful everything is just so inviting
6302124 the time i spent barricaded in a bedroom that morning before the police arrived was the longest scariest time of my life
6302125 many people have said at least nothing was taken but thats definitely not true i would have rather given up all my possessions in order to have my sense of security back
6302126 i came home from the gym to find vincent york gathering my things using a pair of my socks to cover his hands and using my own pillowcase from my bed to carry the items he wanted
6302127 he even helped himself to a bottle of water from the refrigerator which he left wide open
6302128 we like to think of ourselves as on the cutting edge of safety
6302129 the initial response should be going after the shooter and bypassing anybody whos injured because we have to stop further harm
6302130 it was nice to see the second team thought more tactically
6302131 it may not be correct to train that way when its not realistic
6302132 we need to make sure theyre capable of being flexible

6302158 i think it says so much about paulas devotion to this issue
6302159 when she told us shed be having a baby in september i fully expected her to bow out of the event but shes determined to be there and to raise money for turning point
6302160 this past spring tp was notified that our domestic violence funding would be cut by more than 28 percent also without a budget signed by the governor no funding can be released at all so not only do we have this permanent loss of funds but currently we are not even getting the funds that were allocated to turning point
6302161 this is our largest annual fundraiser and while times are hard all over i know that mchenry county will come through for us again
6302162 these funding cuts specifically target our childrens programs we are determined to close this budget gap and not allow our programs to be eliminated

6302172 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so
6302173 just because you have a bilingual program doesnt mean youre off the hook that program still has to provide equal educational opportunities and remove impediments to language barriers
6302174 its not just enough to throw money at it and say ok weve done our part
6302175 you have a lot of educators these days under a lot of stress
6302176 with a more punitive approach to punishing failing schools theres a lot a lot more animosity among the community
6302177 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6302178 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6302179 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe
6302180 they have had all these cuts they are so understaffed that if they were to do anything its only spot checks and only minimal things theyre able to do instead of an agency which can provide assistance and positive support they become reduced to this watchdog group
6302181 bilingual and ell english language learners programs are locally implemented
6302182 we do go and follow up to make sure each district is in compliance but the actual implementation is a local issue
6302183 the fact that there are no latino board members on u 46 indicates that the issues latino children and their parents are facing may not have a voice

6302195 lets face it the governor changed his mind a few days after the recall vote
6302196 certainly closing the prison is not something he wants to do
6302197 at the same time though the funding needs to be available

6302287 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
6302288 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
6302289 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
6302290 never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
6302291 the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
6302292 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
6302293 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
6302294 the last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs for the first time ever a non eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter of eurasian power relations but also as the worlds paramount power the defeat and collapse of the soviet union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a western hemisphere power the united states as the sole and indeed the first truly global power
6302295 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
6302296 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
6302297 for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia now a non eurasian power is preeminent in eurasia and americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained
6302298 americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability it would prompt global anarchy
6302299 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical eurasia is the globes largest continent and is geopolitically axial a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
6302300 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad this limits the use of americas power especially its capacity for military intimidation never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
6302301 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
6302302 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
6302303 henceforth the united states may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push america out of eurasia thereby threatening americas status as a global power
6302304 uzbekistan nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central asian states represents the major obstacle to any renewed russian control over the region its independence is critical to the survival of the other central asian states and it is the least vulnerable to russian pressures
6302305 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
6302306 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the u s department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
6302307 uzbekistan is in fact the prime candidate for regional leadership in central asia
6302308 once pipelines to the area have been developed turkmenistans truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the countrys people
6302309 in fact an islamic revival already abetted from the outside not only by iran but also by saudi arabia is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms determined to oppose any reintegration under russian and hence infidel control
6302310 for pakistan the primary interest is to gain geostrategic depth through political influence in afghanistan and to deny to iran the exercise of such influence in afghanistan and tajikistan and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking central asia with the arabian sea
6302311 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
6302312 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
6302313 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
6302314 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy
6302315 without sustained and directed american involvement before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene and the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of todays eurasia but of the world more generally
6302316 with warning signs on the horizon across europe and asia any successful american policy must focus on eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design
6302317 that puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge americas primacy
6302318 the most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
6302319 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
6302320 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6302321 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6302322 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6302323 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6302324 the end of the cold war was supposed to usher in a new age in which the major powers would no longer dictate to their neighbors how to run their affairs that is why russias invasion of georgia is so tragic and so potentially ominous
6302325 russia is now on watch will it continue to rely on coercion to achieve its imperial aims or is it willing to work within the emerging international system that values cooperation and consensus
6302326 moscows ruthless attempt to suborn subdue and subordinate this tiny independent democracy is reminiscent of stalins times the assault ongeorgia is similar to what stalins soviet union did to finland in 1939 in both cases moscow engaged in an arbitrary brutal and irresponsible use of force to impose domination over a weaker democratic neighbor
6302327 the question now is whether the global community can demonstrate to the kremlin that there are costs for the blatant use of force on behalf of anachronistic imperialist goals
6302328 this conflict has been brewing for years russia has deliberately instigated the breakup of georgian territory moscow has promoted secessionist activities in several georgian provinces abkhazia ajaria and of course south ossetia
6302329 these efforts have intensified since the emergence in georgia of a democratic pro western government russian prime minister vladimir putins resentment toward georgia and its president the u s educated mikhiel saakashvili has seemingly become a personal obsession
6302330 it has sponsored rebellious governments in these territories armed their forces and even bestowed russian citizenship on the secessionists
6302331 in recent weeks a series of incidents along the fragile cease fire lines that cut across georgian territory helped prompt the escalation of violence including georgias abortive effort to remove the
6302332 russias aggression toward georgia should not be viewed as an isolated incident the fact is putin and his associates in the kremlin dont accept the post soviet realities
6302333 ukraine could well be the next flash point the russian leadership has already openly questioned whether it needs to respect ukraines territorial integrity russian leaders have also remarked that crimea a part of ukraine should once again be joined to russia
6302334 the stakes are high ultimately the independence of the post soviet states is at risk russia seems committed to the notion that there should be some sort of supranational entity governed from the kremlin that would oversee much of the former soviet territories this attitude reflects in part the intense nationalistic mood that now permeates russias political lite
6302335 for the west especially the u s the conflict between russia and georgia poses both moral and geostrategic challenges the moral dimension is self evident a small country that gained its independence only recently after almost two centuries of russian domination deserves international support that goes beyond simple declarations of sympathy
6302336 the georgian crisis is a critical test for russia if putin sticks to his guns and subordinates georgia and removes its freely elected president something putins foreign minister has explicitly called for it is only a question of time before moscow turns up the heat on ukraine and the other independent but vulnerable post soviet states the west has to respond carefully but with a moral and strategic focus its objective has to be a democratic russia that is a constructive participant in a global system based on respect for sovereignty law and democracy but that objective can be achieved only if the world makes clear to moscow that a stridently nationalistic russia will not succeed in any effort to create a new empire in our postimperial age

6302345 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6302346 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6302347 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6302350 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6302351 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6302352 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6302353 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6302354 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6302357 at this point its not about a russia that is bent on an imperial conquest
6302358 i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this
6302359 and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive and we have tried not to respond in that manner
6302360 at this point its not about a russia that is bent on an imperial conquest
6302361 i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this
6302362 and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive and we have tried not to respond in that manner
6302363 there has been a constant military campaign that clearly is very difficult to achieve largely because the region is mountainous and the local population is either indifferent or sympathetic to the extremists
6302364 the algerian authorities are facing a major problem in terms of conceiving a way of dealing with this
6302365 the government is not openly dictatorial but it is incompetent and unresponsive
6302366 unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6302367 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6302368 the armed groups no longer have the ability overturn power by force and install the islamic republic for which they are fighting and killing citizens
6302369 the reader is invited to accept the notion of a quality assessment framework that is non prescriptive enough to be applied in a variety of training and education settings and brief enough to be conveniently digested from time to time by all practitioners whether they are lecturers or those who manage and support them
6302370 this is a book that can easily be appreciated by anyone regardless of their livelihood who has an interest in the education of adults for educators it will revive that sense of making a difference to the world which brings so many into teaching in the first place
6302371 most stocks are tending to enter a sort of a range because the market is entering a range so mainly the weakness yesterday was with ongc now it is heading closer to support between rs 970 980 on the upside you have resistance around rs 1 120 1 125
6302372 the way inflation pans out if it is within expectation you will see probably some further upmove in banking if its bit more again they will go into a shell so nothing is looking particularly weak or particularly strong everything is tending to now get into a range but the problem clearly remains if we dont breakout soon this uptrend will tend to loss its strength and then we may follow the other global markets on the way down which means that the outperformance may not last unless the conditions change
6302373 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven

6302389 during takeoff especially at this point in the takeoff roll the aircraft has the maximum amount of fuel its gonna have at any other point in the flight
6302390 so theres always an increased risk of fire at this point in time
6302391 theres probably growing concern at the faa at the regulators across the world of whether the economic downturn in the aviation industry may be having some effect on maintenance
6302392 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all

6302394 if we are going to see any positive reform steps from the government it will be in psu banking and hopefully that will happen when parliament goes in session i think psu banking in terms of valuation did see a huge upsurge from the lows which we saw in july and maybe if they come down a little more then there would be perhaps an opportunity to invest over there too i would take the leaders again state bank of india punjab national bank and bank of india as my opportunity to get into these stocks i think there could be a move from the government which will help these stocks to be revalued or re rated upwards

6302449 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6302450 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6302451 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6302452 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6302468 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6302469 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6302470 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6302471 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6302472 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us

6302484 while her positions would seem to be political suicide in conservative kansas she has enjoyed high approval ratings winning her last election in 2006 by a landslide sebelius has been a master at taking advantage of the schism in the kansas republican party the constant warfare between the so called conservatives and so called moderates and she has worked hard to focus on issues that have widespread appeal to most kansans such as education and health care
6302485 one hand on her job the other across the aisle
6302486 warner will likely tout his bipartisanship and bring a message that appeals both to the democratic base as well as independents it is what has made him immensely popular in a traditionally republican state and the postpartisan message worked for obama four years ago
6302487 dont expect warner to throw red meat on the republicans in denver or for him to utilize soaring poetry the way obama did

6302500 the sbc church compensation study is an important resource for churches to use as they seek to determine appropriate salaries for their staff members
6302501 our prayer is that churches will use it both as they seek to hire new staff but also as they retain existing staff to ensure their compensation is competitive with other churches and within their communities

6302525 equi lavezzi mi fa impazzire darei fiducia a vitale sogno sempre il gol promozione
6302526 avevo disputato una grande stagione con gli azzurri culminata con la promozione in serie a dopo parecchi anni avevo una gran voglia di far bene anche in un campionato molto pi difficile della serie cadetta ma una sera mi chiam il mio procuratore dicendomi che la societ mi avevano venduto al torino per circa 8 miliardi fu una doccia gelata lasciare la piazza e il calore di napoli stato difficilissimo per me resto nella storia azzurra al pari con sallustro per il maggior numero di reti siglate in una stagione una gioia immensa che porter con me per sempre sar per sempre legato alla maglia azzurra
6302527 certo il rammarico grande perch quella squadra si era amalgamata benissimo senza cambiare tecnico e senza rivoluzionare completamente tutto lo staff sia dirigenziale sia il parco giocatori quel napoli sicuramente non sarebbe sceso in serie b subito
6302528 secondo me ora completo sono state apportate le modifiche necessarie lo scorso anno zalayeta e lavezzi gi avevano fatto vedere di essere attaccanti di spessore ora con gli inserimenti di denis e russotto credo che il puzzle sia completo ritengo ci sia il giusto mix di forza concretezza e imprevedibilit che fanno si che la squadra di reja possa facilmente piazzarsi alle spalle delle big
6302529 partendo dal fatto che sono per la linea per i giovani non ritengo sia unutopia che vitale possa fare bene in questo campionato ha tutte le qualit per imporsi c da vedere per come il giocatore sappia sopportare le pressioni della piazza che essendo affamata di calcio sempre molto esigente se dovesse partita dopo partita acquisire sempre pi fiducia credo diventer la sorpresa degli azzurri
6302530 sicuramente juve e milan sono attrezzate meglio ma lentusiasmo dei tifosi napoletani potrebbe sopperire ad una leggera mancanza tecnica quindi credo gli azzurri siano nettamente favoriti dal fattore ambientale
6302531 il calcio cambiato ci sono pochissimi giocatori che possono risolvere le partite da soli per esperienza personale sono rimasto stupefatto dalle giocate di zidane che per me tra i cinque giocatori pi forti della storia del calcio
6302532 il gol pi bello lho siglato nel derby vicenza verona cross dalla trequarti e conclusione allincrocio lapoteosi invece il pi emozionante sicuramente quello della promozione in a con gli azzurri a pistoia allo stadio toscano cerano circa 6000 tifosi azzurri un emozione incredibile solo se ci penso mi vengono i brividi
6302533 senza dubbio giovinco che ha grosse potenzialit ma provo anche ammirazione per lanzafame del palermo
6302534 equi lavezzi mi fa impazzire darei fiducia a vitale sogno sempre il gol

6302544 improving sexual health is a government health priority so increasing the range of condoms available can only be good in terms of encouraging safe sex practices
6302545 condoms are already funded and always have been this decision sees a 10 per cent price reduction for all condoms which frees up funds that can be used to purchase other new medicines
6302546 morally bankrupt and an insult to people with breast cancer high blood pressure and heart disease
6302547 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms
6302548 this is simply about funding sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer or other more life threatening medication

6302558 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not

6302561 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6302562 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6302563 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6302564 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6302565 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6302566 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6302567 a person opts to go over the border their information is going to be collected and held anyway
6302568 if you dont want to go over the border you dont have to

6302579 the features of heaven as described by the messenger of allah
6302580 it was mentioned by daraj ibn abi hatim that abu al haytham adullah ibn wahb narrated from abu said al khudhri who heard the prophet muhammad saying the smallest reward for the people of heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand servants and seventy two houri over which stands a dome decorated with pearls aquamarine and ruby as wide as the distance from al jabiyyah to sana 2
6302581 the law is so obviously unjust and discriminatory it ought to at least be the subject of debate

6302595 there is a growing surge of people out there just craving
6302596 to traditional american government limited government that places personal liberty first and places an emphasis on personal responsibility and essentially gets out of the way after that
6302597 the buzz we get from supporters is that they are very eager to come to st paul and very eager to send a strong message
6302598 conventions are about demonstrating unity and purpose and showcasing the nominee they are media events made for prime time tv any distraction from the central message of the convention is not helpful
6302599 he never seemed to be an open opponent of the republican party but more about what the republicans need to get back to
6302600 this is a golden opportunity for him to do that
6302601 theyre there for their political convention to nominate their candidate were supplementing it liberty is getting short shrift right now were giving our people a place to go for those days
6302602 a clear call to the republican party to return to its roots of limited government personal responsibility and protection of our natural rights
6302603 the real action is going to be at the xcel center where one of the people who does have a chance to be president is going to be speaking and rallying the troops
6302604 when people come to st paul in september theyre not going to be focused on ron paul
6302605 the market momentum guiding the future of newspapers is especially brutal in the larger markets many have already passed the point of opportunity as it is too late for newspapers that have not successfully adopted marketing practices needed to support the core product and integrate with alternative distribution channels for those who have not made the transition technology and market factors may be too strong to enable success

6302918 teria sido melhor se n o tivesse feito o gesto de agarre me se puder na final dos 100 m quando abriu os bra os e olhou para o p blico como se fizesse pouco caso dos advers rios
6302919 o lance do bol var foi legal e o p nalti deles n o foi falta
6302920 o bandeirinha me disse que sinalizou a falta e que o jogador devia ser expulso mas o juiz n o quis dar

6302922 we believe more information can only help consumers make informed decisions and help us to make changes
6302923 priority repairs have been completed except the band orchestra area
6302924 we are trying to bring the structure back to the original design or as close as possible
6302925 typically for this type of construction you are looking at a 30 40 50 year service life and often times it exceeds that
6302926 the simple answer will be 50 years but buildings can last for a long time provided that they remain functional
6302927 obviously there were some things that were not identified in those inspections
6302928 i cant come out and say that we have looked at everything
6302929 there are some things that are hidden within walls if there is no reason to believe there is a problem there are some things that arent really feasible without destroying the school we have looked at all areas of the masonry walls every stone hasnt been turned
6302930 the district is funding this we hope to recapture these funds through litigation
6302931 that is when martha cut me from behind with a knife
6302932 she cut my neck and stabbed me in the shoulder and in my stomach i yelled for help and people started coming out i escaped and started running toward the buildings
6302933 i tried to help martha and in return i have suffered greatly
6302934 i wish to be there for my daughter while she still is a child to help her and guide her so she doesnt make the same bad decisions i have made
6302935 i myself come from a family of alcoholics and addicts and i dont want her to fall victim to this horrible disease but to break the cycle so she doesnt have to have the life that i have lived
6302936 i wonder what will happen if i pull this lever
6302937 i learned the lesson a long time ago that when youre learning something new its easier to be able to set aside your ego and be willing to laugh at yourself screwing up
6302938 o placar foi justo sa mos bem tivemos chance de matar o jogo duas vezes com o diego e o kl ber n o fizemos o inter cresceu e fez o resultado depois que o inter virou ficou com todo espa o poss vel e foi melhor foi um placar por merecimento deles
6302939 quando se perde o jogo se acha um monte de culpados eu s vi um o inter que jogou bem e virou o placar n o sou santos dumont n o vou ficar inventando desculpas os jogadores sabiam que o ndio chegava daquele jeito mas erraram o que normal no futebol
6302940 deu para perceber que tivemos o jogo nas m os com 1 a 0 contra o inter estava desequilibrado tanto que roubamos duas tr s bolas da zaga deles t nhamos que ter matado o jogo eles iam ficar desestabilizados totalmente o goleiro deles j estava at empurrando o nosso jogador depois que viraram controlaram o jogo
6302941 se o p nalti n o existiu e o gol do inter estava em posi o legal o tite est correto n o tenho que discutir o que est claro
6302942 we like to think of ourselves as on the cutting edge of safety
6302943 the initial response should be going after the shooter and bypassing anybody whos injured because we have to stop further harm
6302944 it was nice to see the second team thought more tactically
6302945 it may not be correct to train that way when its not realistic
6302946 we need to make sure theyre capable of being flexible

6302961 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6302962 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6302963 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6302964 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6302965 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6302966 the time i spent barricaded in a bedroom that morning before the police arrived was the longest scariest time of my life
6302967 many people have said at least nothing was taken but thats definitely not true i would have rather given up all my possessions in order to have my sense of security back

6302995 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished
6302996 you know touch wood there is still a lot of work to be done
6302997 the only statement i think somebody in a position like this can responsibly make is that it obviously depends on the conditions and how much risk one is willing to take
6302998 the fact is that general casey and zal khalilzad signed an assessment in december early december of 2006 that said the strategy is failing
6302999 we started putting joint security stations right in the heart of areas

6303007 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty
6303008 it is a very important document for the u s and india
6303009 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6303010 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view

6303013 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6303014 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6303015 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys

6303023 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years
6303024 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6303025 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank
6303026 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6303027 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6303028 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6303029 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do
6303030 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive

6303082 any time a leader dies its a moment of uncertainty and potential instability for the leadership here

6303084 huas death will not have a big influence now but can let us reflect on that period
6303085 he was an important transitional figure in history without him the cultural revolution might not have finished soon and we might not have reform and opening at all
6303086 how long did it take you to write wild goose chase
6303087 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6303088 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6303089 no its another president that you know that mommy really likes
6303090 certainly this is the kind of political approach we favour
6303091 every country places on the record its views but no one blocks the decision and at the end the germans as chair declare the text adopted
6303092 we will make our presentation explaining our policy restating our bottom line and answering any questions
6303093 while it would be good to do this in one sitting in all likelihood there will probably have to be a second round of discussions
6303094 in effect we only have a day and half now and that may not be enough time
6303095 it is easier to work the political side of this deal than dealing with technical level players whose attitudes tend to be more rigid
6303096 and at the end of the day that is not going to be acceptable to us
6303097 we know the u s has been extensively consulting with a number of nsg members and probably has a sheet of paper with a bunch of conditions that it will say the others want
6303098 the u s likes to have its own rules and grant waiver authority to the president so it will not want the nsg to adopt something which will make it mandatory for the u s to act in a particular way if something happens between india and another supplier
6303099 i think for them the big fear is enrichment and reprocessing equipment
6303100 they have decided they will never give it to india but if tomorrow the russians or french throw in some enr equipment as a sweetener for a reactor contract which u s suppliers wont be able to do they fear others will have a commercial advantage
6303101 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6303102 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6303103 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6303104 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6303105 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6303106 right now we are selling spaces for 20 for crafters and people with yard sale items
6303107 the sale will start at 8 a m because a lot of people who do yard sales like to go out early it will end sometime in the afternoon when most of the goods are sold
6303108 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6303109 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6303110 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6303111 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6303112 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6303113 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6303114 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6303115 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6303116 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6303117 its just a shame that the district attorneys office couldnt notify my office or ms connor prior to releasing the report
6303118 we will have a more detailed statement thursday once we see the statement
6303119 it is clear that the decedents own actions resulted in his death
6303120 the police used all reasonable measures to avoid the eventual outcome and to apprehend the decedent without the use of force
6303121 the police used commands mace and then their weapons as the decedent escalated the situation the decedent apparently wanted to be shot in what has frequently been referred to as suicide by cop
6303122 it is an unfortunate outcome particularly because it is apparent that the decedent suffered from significant mental health issues and a crack cocaine addiction
6303123 these conditions appear to have caused his irrational state of mind and ultimately contributed to his death
6303124 the evidence is undisputed that the decedent engaged in bizarre threatening and violent conduct that reasonably caused the officers to fear imminent danger of death or great bodily injury
6303125 furthermore the police had good reason to think that the decedent had committed a felony and was capable of inflicting further injury or death if he was not apprehended
6303126 while we mourn the fact that a human life was lost we are grateful for the courageous actions taken by the officers involved when they were faced with a decision that every police officer knows he she may have to make some day but hopes that day never comes
6303127 this matter quickly escalated and within minutes of the call being made
6303128 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6303129 we want to be on location there are many questions

6303131 occasionally when they get the virus they come out and bite people
6303132 were not getting big numbers in the traps but we are getting them

6303134 the 2 million for the elm street bridge was included in the final and signed transportation bond bill
6303135 the 500 000 for the chace street rotary was also included
6303136 even if it is there listed in the bond bill there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to make it eligible for state funds
6303137 the town has not received a formal commitment to get the work done a project named by a state representative in a bond bill does not guarantee that the project will be paid for the project still has to go over reviews and priority settings with masshighway
6303138 it will mean that both phase 1 and phase 2 of the bridge repair will be done at no cost to the local taxpayers
6303139 having the money in the bond bill gives the town the opportunity to secure funds for the project
6303140 no bond items are necessarily guaranteed to be authorized the selectmen know this and we will need to advocate collectively for inclusion within the bond cap
6303141 the roundabout will compete with other projects on the transportation improvement program i dont believe that masshighway has actually started the design a lot depends on how fast the design gets done with the other projects on the books it can be a time consuming process involving public hearings
6303142 i didnt see it taking off as well as it has
6303143 weve been doing about 3 000 rounds of golf a month and weve recovered a lot of the outings and functions we used to have here
6303144 we have an outing or function scheduled every week through september
6303145 the next six weeks will be better than the previous three months and its 100 percent better than its been here the past few years
6303146 as long as the greens arent frozen well keep the course open
6303147 maybe well run a sunday morning league and follow it with lunch or dinner afterwards so people can stay and watch the patriots game on our flat screen tvs hopefully we can come up with a few more creative things to keep people around the course this fall
6303148 with rounds of golfers depleting its tough to pump money back into these clubs some places used to bump up the greens fees as the number of rounds went down but we want to keep the fees low so the people will come back
6303149 we want to make it more accessible we may take a hit on the greens fees but we want to keep people on the first tee we dont want to deter the people who dont play exceptionally well because they can play and not have it cost them 50 to 60
6303150 there was a long period of hot weather with no rain and then we had a lot of rain dumped on us in a short period of time that makes it tough to fertilize the course
6303151 the course work is the key we have to get more light to the greens and try to install underground drainage its a steady general improvement the transformation from the end of february to the end of august is really something and im proud to be part of something like this from the ground floor up this has absolutely been a success
6303152 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6303153 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6303154 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6303155 in some instances the photographing has been accompanied by threatening statements
6303156 we have filed charges against unite here in hopes that the union will stop threatening and harassing our employees
6303157 we regret that this action is necessary but our employees deserve to make their own membership choices without any fear of union harassment

6303164 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6303165 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6303166 we have no records of these two names in our system
6303167 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6303168 defending the rights of the people is still such a difficult thing even 60 years after the establishment of the republic
6303169 its not over but its given jacob hope i believe this drug could potentially save his life i have great hope for this drug
6303170 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6303171 his condition has already deteriorated significantly in the past year
6303172 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6303173 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6303174 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6303175 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6303176 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6303177 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6303178 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6303179 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6303180 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6303181 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6303182 i think a shirt that says support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6303183 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6303184 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6303185 i emphasize that davis personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6303186 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6303187 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6303188 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6303189 bahkan pada mesin diesel rpm 2000 sudah bisa mencapai gigi enam
6303190 he must have decided its more important to get a speedy trial than to have all those days free to campaign
6303191 we want the verdict as far on this side of election day as possible
6303192 a defendant is only a punching bag at this stage
6303193 we cannot even begin to fight back until they begin their case
6303194 i was the one who launched the careers of john terry and zola
6303195 i think its kind of dangerous to try and link it with any long range pattern at all
6303196 when those dissimilar air masses interact thats when you get storms thunderstorms lots of rain
6303197 very very unusual thats something that hasnt happened in a long long while
6303198 you cant make a connection to the cyclical variability in the weather that we are experiencing this summer to that
6303199 weather is very variable and it does you know have its extremes
6303200 you cant take an individual event and give it a tag that says global warming
6303201 lets face it there are lot of things that we dont understand about weather and climate
6303202 it depends on a lot more variables than one simple answer
6303203 where this storm did hit it hit a heck of a lot harder than hurricane bob did

6303240 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made

6303253 it allows them to pursue their personal passion while working at american express
6303254 and it allows them to leave their legacy behind and get the next generation of leaders and experts ready
6303255 one of the things that weve really focused on is paying as much attention to the person whos transferring the knowledge as to the person whos receiving it
6303256 mainstreaming the fact that major sports events need a large place online because there is an audience for it and there are ad dollars for it
6303257 the type of content were producing appeals to the casual fan
6303258 seeing the events live appeals more to the fans who are passionate about a particular sport
6303259 if programmers understand that people will watch different programs on different platforms we can stop playing the game of trying to replace tv
6303260 events look great on hdtvs whether they are sports shows or movies quick hits and short clips are great for the internet
6303261 the quality of the video from the olympics through silverlight has been some of the best online streaming content yet
6303262 while in the midwest youve seen manufacturing and the auto industry falling off farmers are doing really well
6303263 so when youre looking at casinos you should look at them on a regional basis
6303264 we want to win so in the high end space running traditional gaming applications dx opengl etc we will win and when you take advantage of its unique characteristics and some of the more advanced techniques that it will enable it will shine
6303265 what weve said is that the first market for larrabee is discrete graphics and were out to win running traditional games and if you take advantage of the new capabilities of larrabee we think itll be highly differentiated a much superior architecture compared to anything else thats in the marketplace then weve said that were going to bring it across the market right into the volume segments of discrete as well as explore adjacent markets including things like high performance computing workstations and including game consoles we think its a pretty compelling alternative for that and wed be delighted to win some of those with it obviously no products announced or anything like that but we think its a very natural adjacency

6303272 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6303273 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
6303274 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
6303275 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
6303276 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
6303277 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
6303278 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris britney ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
6303279 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
6303280 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
6303281 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
6303282 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
6303283 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
6303284 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
6303285 hes starting a blistering tv campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism
6303286 now john you know that every time he tries to get tough he quickly runs out of gas sometimes in debates hed be exhausted by the third question he must use up all his energy in the gym he doesnt have any stamina and he certainly doesnt have our bloodlust besides you can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos
6303287 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me
6303288 that was inspired to snatch his convention away makes him look so weak listen why dont you stop in sedona on the way to denver wear a black wig and ill spirit you up to the cabin for the night ill catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you it will be an adventure

6303294 renewable fuels consumer protection and energy efficiency act of 2007
6303295 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6303296 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6303297 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6303298 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6303299 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6303300 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6303301 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6303302 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6303303 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6303304 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6303305 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6303306 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6303307 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6303308 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6303309 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6303310 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6303311 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6303312 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6303313 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6303314 the song is the second single from solanges forthcoming album
6303315 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6303316 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6303317 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6303318 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6303319 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6303320 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6303321 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6303322 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6303323 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6303324 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6303325 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6303326 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be

6303407 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6303408 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6303409 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6303410 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6303411 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6303412 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6303413 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6303414 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6303415 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said

6303430 we respected another communitys allegations initially but nothing has come forward no charges no indictments no evidence thats compelling for us
6303431 at this point its been a year and our feeling is our kids deserve their coach and well go forward with our program
6303432 im very happy for jimmy that hes back on the field its been a long year obviously the kids deserve it and jimmys done everything weve asked him to do in the last 12 months
6303433 other than to say that it is both active and ongoing
6303434 this office doesnt confirm deny or discuss an investigation in the absence of criminal charges
6303435 i was told last summer that an indictment was coming and thats why i was put on administrative leave
6303436 a year later the case has been brought before the grand jury no charges or indictment have come and im still not back on the job
6303437 now that im coaching full time all my energy is focused on the football field its been that way since last year actually i just wasnt able to get on the field
6303438 i have a personality and a way of getting points across to the kids
6303439 hes a great guy he gets the team going a lot he gets the team pumped up
6303440 it feels like the teams more motivated were going to probably come out strong for our first game
6303441 karena itu sudah selayaknya insan kreatif seperti pencinta fesyen dan industri fesyen itu sendiri berbuat sesuatu seperti penyelenggaraan fashion show ini

6303443 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6303444 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6303445 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6303446 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6303447 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6303448 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death the police dont even arrest you they just shoot you
6303449 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6303450 weve also had some reasonably good falls across the metro area including 9mm in the city and 11 6mm in the westernport area
6303451 i certainly wouldnt want to be outdoors today and especially with those bitterly cold winds blowing
6303452 its basically another cold front moving through bringing some pretty cold air continuing our wintery conditions
6303453 snow is going to happen mainly overnight as the coldest of the air move across the state were expecting it to fall as low as 500m mostly above 700m
6303454 that could include the dandenongs and a lot of the great divide
6303455 we could expect the hail in western and central areas later this afternoon and continuing tomorrow morning in central and eastern parts of the state
6303456 i would be guessing 5 15mm in the south and higher in the ranges
6303457 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6303458 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6303459 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6303460 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6303461 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6303462 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6303463 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6303464 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive

6303468 man this isnt the way i wanted to go home with a medal
6303469 i would love to have crossed the line in the third place position because i looked at the replay and i dont feel like it gave spearmon an advantage i feel like he was deserving of the third place position
6303470 i was tall when i was little says bolt in trelawny parish on the north shore of jamaica an hours drive from the vacation resorts of montego bay and ocho rios he loved to play cricket with his friends and if he was talented he was also a little lazy
6303471 good tv poor sportsmanship said nbc analyst and four time olympian
6303472 he realizes that these kind of opportunities dont come along very often
6303473 i told myself im going to leave everything on the track i did just that
6303474 get in his head collins said even before bolt won the 100 meters long time los angeles based track agent

6303477 usain is just laughing and chilling im telling you the guy is just different
6303478 thats the big difference between this race and michael johnsons race said former british olympic sprinter
6303479 michael was under pressure from ato and frankie usain was all alone
6303480 i hear he looked impressive but i didnt really get to see hes 6 foot 5 and he runs like hes 5 9 he ran 9 6 in the 100 celebrating at 70 meters and hes been a 200 400 runner in the past when he got in the 200 meters here you knew he was going to run something very fast
6303481 i was saying i look cool that guy looks fast
6303482 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6303483 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6303484 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6303485 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6303486 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6303487 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women

6303489 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6303490 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6303491 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6303492 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6303493 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6303494 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6303495 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6303496 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6303497 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6303498 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6303499 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6303500 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6303501 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6303502 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6303503 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women

6303535 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past

6303554 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6303555 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6303556 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6303557 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6303558 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6303563 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6303564 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill

6303570 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6303571 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6303572 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6303573 oprah now ive read in your book that you said if i just replaced coffee with green tea instead that i could lose 10 pounds in six weeks dr perricone absolutely oprah now really how could that what is the big deal about this dr perricone coffee has organic acids that raise your blood sugar raise insulin insulin puts a lock on body fat when you switch over to green tea you get your caffeine youre all set but you will drop your insulin levels and body fat will fall very rapidly so 10 pounds in six weeks i will guarantee it oprah im gonna do that ok that is so good whoo that is great

6303578 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6303579 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6303580 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6303581 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6303582 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6303583 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6303584 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

6303593 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
6303594 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
6303595 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
6303596 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom

6303604 they told me there are going to be resources here
6303605 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6303606 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6303607 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6303608 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6303609 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6303610 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6303611 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6303612 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6303613 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6303621 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6303622 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6303623 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6303643 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6303644 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6303645 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6303646 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6303647 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6303648 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6303664 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

6303666 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6303667 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6303668 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6303669 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6303670 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6303671 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6303672 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6303673 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6303674 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6303675 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6303676 with bad economic times and home foreclosures we are being inundated with pets

6303688 representatives of the national executive for the australian christian churches recently met with michael guglielmucci
6303689 at this meeting he read a statement indicating that his claim to have cancer was untrue
6303690 his credential with the australian christian churches was immediately suspended
6303691 i went to the hospital expecting to have some tests and got the news that i had cancer and quite an aggressive form of cancer
6303692 i walked into my studio at home and for some reason pressed record which was a good thing i just sat at a piano and began to worship
6303693 i didnt like sit down and write the verses and the chorus i just sang that song from the start to the finish
6303694 i just realised that god had given me an incredible gift and i knew that was going to be my strength
6303695 should this still be on here can someone delete it mike never had cancer its all a lie he made up its embarrassing and sad to watch
6303696 there were no fundraisers conducted however when michael left the church 18 months ago a special offering was taken up in honor of his services to the church
6303697 planetshakers church did not ask for any congregational financial support to be given to michael and we have not given him any financial assistance since

6303700 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6303701 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6303702 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6303703 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6303704 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6303705 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6303706 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6303707 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6303713 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6303714 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6303744 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6303745 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6303746 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

6303768 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6303769 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6303770 or do you think scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us

6303824 im quite optimistic that it is going to be a pro life conservative republican
6303825 john mccain is seriously considering choosing a pro abortion rights running mate despite vocal resistance from conservatives
6303826 john mccains partner should be one that would help him get additional voters and neither one of those two would bring to the table anything that would get any more votes for mccain
6303827 it would certainly create a lot of soul searching in the hearts of a lot of republicans
6303828 would there be some murmuring from some corners im sure
6303829 in the end the president is going to pick the justices of the supreme court the president is going to speak for the administration
6303830 i would not change my support of sen mccain i think sen mccain is far and away the best choice to be our next commander in chief

6303833 i dont think we should read anything into those names
6303834 they are just the top rate top flight names in the republican party
6303835 it really is what were building this convention and this campaign around
6303836 its fair to say this speech will reflect norm colemans optimistic positive vision for minnesota which will match up with john mccains optimistic and positive vision for america
6303837 the governors definitely looking forward to coming out to the convention and helping senator mccain in any way he can
6303838 they are clearly offering a graceful exit for president bush and vice president cheney
6303839 they want to introduce a new product line called mccain for president

6303858 wherein energy is produced from the motion of a magnet passing through a coil
6303859 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6303860 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6303861 an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6303862 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6303863 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and

6303870 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6303871 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6303951 the year of the 1968 olympics a world of struggle and turmoil
6303952 when you go to the games you take yourself with you and what you do and how you do it is going to have an impact

6303954 the black fist in the air was only in recognition of those who had gone it was a prayer of solidarity it was a cry for help by my fellow brothers and sisters in this country who had been lynched who had been shot who had been bitten by dogs who water hoses had been set on a cry for freedom you could almost hear the wind blowing around my fist
6303955 my raised right hand stood for the power in black america
6303956 the beads were for those individuals that were lynched or killed that no one said a prayer for that were hung tarred it was for those thrown off the side of the boats in the middle passage all that was in my mind
6303957 we as individuals have been concerned about the place of the black man in american society in their struggle for equal rights as members of the u s olympic team each of us has come to feel a moral commitment to support our black teammates in their efforts to dramatize the injustices and inequities which permeate out society

6303959 if you are one of the worlds greatest in a particular field as i was in athletics you have an avenue and you have a responsibility to use it especially if you have something to say about society and how people are treated people who are not in the position to say it themselves or who dont have the ability to say it

6303963 to be vindicated means that i did something wrong i didnt do anything wrong i just carried out a responsibility we felt a need to represent a lot of people who did more than we did but had no platform people who suffered long before i got to the victory stand were celebrated as heroes by some but were still fighting for equality
6303964 i do not like being the personification of a problem much less a problem involving a killer disease but i know i must seize these opportunities to spread the word

6303972 when we were approached about doing this show we knew right away that we wanted to be involved

6303974 both an increase and reaching a certain level of virus activity faster in the season
6303975 notorious for being focal and sporadic so finding one relatively small area that has higher transmission activity than other areas is more normal than abnormal
6303976 you put all these complicated factors together and in certain circumstances you could wind up with a situation that promotes more virus activity
6303977 so they have the knowledge to allow them to respond appropriately
6303978 it may be reassuring to know that that many people probably have immunities because they were infected in the past but never got sick
6303979 frankly this is beginning to look like its based mostly on myth not data
6303980 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies

6303986 itll keep kids out of trouble i think college kids are responsible enough to take care of themselves
6303987 they shouldnt be able to drink if theyre seniors in high school if i was allowed to drink when i was 18 i definitely would have gotten drunk every day after high school it would have been bad news
6303988 it would be much better to say youre 18 now
6303989 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6303990 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6303991 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6303992 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida

6304012 we poker players dont call poker gambling it is a game of skill craps is an absurd game of luck you may have thrilling short term wins but only madmen play craps
6304013 the moment the car stopped at mccains hotel in downtown new orleans he set out at his usual fast clip for harrahs across the street mccain is an avid gambler wes gullett a close friend who worked for mccain for years told me that they used to play craps in las vegas in fourteen hour stints standing at the tables from 10 a m to midnight craps is addictive mccain remarked and he headed for the fifteen dollar minimum bet tables
6304014 over time he gave up the drinking bouts but he never quite kicked the periodic yen for dice
6304015 only recently have mccains aides urged him to pull back from the pastime in the heat of the g o p primary fight last spring he announced on a visit to the vegas strip that he was going to the casino floor when his aides stopped him fearing a public relations disaster mccain suggested that they ask the casino to take a craps table to a private room a high roller privilege mccain had indulged in before his aides with alarm bells ringing refused again according to two accounts of the discussion he clearly knows that this is on the borderline of what is acceptable for him to be doing
6304016 in all the discussion of john mccains recently recovered memory of a religious epiphany in vietnam one thing has been missing
6304017 according to the bush administrations definition of torture mccain was therefore not tortured
6304018 in the military commissions act mccain acquiesced to the use of these techniques against terror suspects by the cia and so the tortured became the enabler of torture someone somewhere cried out in pain for the same reasons mccain once did and mccain let it continue
6304019 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
6304020 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
6304021 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
6304022 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
6304023 there are a few countries that will say told you so

6304032 of the social institutions that mould mens lives between home and work in an industrial town such as worktown the pub has more buildings holds more people takes more of their money than church cinema dance hall and political organizations put together
6304033 the only kind of public building used by large numbers of ordinary people where their thoughts and actions are not being in some way arranged for them in the other kinds of public building they are the audiences watchers of political religious dramatic cinematic instructional or athletic spectacles but within the four walls of the pub once a man has bought or been bought his glass of beer he has entered an environment in which he is a participator rather than a spectator
6304034 intimate social groups come into being there even if only to last the night benches surround the tables forcing physical intimacy between customers small groups of twos or threes who find themselves at the same or adjoining tables often make friends with their neighbours and share wine schnapps jokes and game playing the rest of the evening

6304052 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs joness medical condition declined
6304053 medical doctors and neurosurgeons from huron hospital and cleveland clinic sadly report that at 6 12 p m congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones died
6304054 she dedicated her life in public service to helping others and will continue to do so through organ donations
6304055 please keep her family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time

6304059 recounted carl burroughs of the national weather service in boulder
6304060 they want to get me some reps in a game
6304061 to hit those beams is a hang time of 5 1 5 2
6304062 its a good measure it helps you work on swinging up on the ball in here
6304063 i was hoping that wed have him for the first ball game and ive said it before i think the important thing is how he feels about it
6304064 you come off that particular surgery its a bugger its tough i think that every player ive known particularly at wide receiver bobby engram being an example youre nervous about it youre unsure even though youre running and that stuff hows it going to react when you get into a game
6304065 all those lists and things take a back seat to his ability to play and when he can play
6304066 weac has always been one of the biggest of the big players in state legislative races if theyre not the top spender in most state legislative races theyre certainly one of the top two or three and i expect that theyll spend millions
6304067 wisconsin right to life works for right to life candidates regardless of their party certainly were hoping that the current leadership remains in the assembly simply because it is a strong majority right to life in the state senate we have a slim majority even though democrats are in control but democrats are in leadership and they do prevent legislation from reaching the senate floor for a vote
6304068 the losers in all of this are ordinary citizens and voters not only are they kept in the dark about whos trying to influence elections but then when the elections are over those interest groups have an enormous amount of influence over our elected officials and they want something in return for all the money they spend on these elections our research shows that time and time again theyre getting tax breaks and pork barrel spending projects
6304069 government is now attempting to infringe on speech and we think its just plain wrong not only for our group but for any group of citizens that simply is practicing their right to address the government in the country that we live in
6304070 me i was called back in february which was like three months early and this was the priority was these potholes obviously because the news was covering it and it was top line emergency
6304071 my name is tom beyer its my first year as a seasonal laborer
6304072 were moving so quick were doing a hole were moving ahead doing more holes we cover a lot of ground within a day and we could like this block here we could just knock it out like in about 50 minutes
6304073 right any lose asphalt or concrete chunks that need to come out of the hole we try to clean it up as best as possible to so the asphalt will sit in there better
6304074 the part that makes me uncomfortable is when you have holes with a lot of debris youve got to put is on the side of the road see like he did there to me thats like you know so believe it or not what i do sometimes is i leave a note for the house and i say 286 city
6304075 and i tell you the shovel slide in there you could pretty much drop it in the hole and it would just melt in the hole real nice
6304076 you always look for anything that needs work whether its on your list or not some people may just do a couple of holes in front of the address theyre assigned but common sense tells you if the block needs it you do the block if you ride by a street thats not on your list and its real bad you do that street because it needs it our job isnt to finish our list our job is to get these streets functional smooth ride able you know
6304077 if we get a bad winter like that and this water gets in those cracks and then it comes right up and before you know it winter time youre doing it all over like next summer well be doing a lot of this all over again its very repetitive year after year so its a its job security thats for sure
6304078 its the argument that people in dorns position always make but it never proves to be true

6304081 gordon smith cant defend his record so hes resorted to attack ads that distort the facts
6304082 is the one who cant be trusted with oregonians hard earned tax dollars
6304083 the smith people must think they have hit paydirt here since they are going back for a second round of ads
6304084 the democratic senatorial campaign committee must be concerned because they are responding to it
6304085 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6304086 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6304087 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6304088 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6304089 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6304090 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6304091 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6304092 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6304093 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6304094 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels

6304100 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6304101 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6304102 we feel like kellen gives us the best chance right now
6304103 weve said that all along well play a freshman well play a senior whoever we think we can win with right now thats the guy were going with
6304104 im very thankful that the coaches have the confidence in me and feel that im ready to take over and follow the long tradition of quarterbacks at this school
6304105 i cant wait to watch him play because i think hes got a tremendous feel for the game
6304106 we just feel this guy is extremely ready to go
6304107 it just has come down to a gut feeling to tell you the truth he may have been a little more consistent then theres just a lot of instinctual things that are very hard to coach in fact i dont think you can coach
6304108 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6304109 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6304110 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived

6304114 solid performances across most its businesses with earnings for the 2009 financial year
6304115 overall the businesses we owned for the full year recorded a 15 per cent increase in revenue and 16 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax managing director richard goyder said
6304116 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but i continue to strongly believe that the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers mr goyder said
6304117 market share has been stabilising as a result it said
6304118 while retail markets are becoming more challenging as household budgets come under pressure and consumer confidence softens these actions are collectively designed to lay the foundations of change and a sustained improvement in performance it said
6304119 strong results while the resources sector is expected to be
6304120 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6304121 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6304122 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6304123 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6304124 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6304125 its a great symbol of where we are as a football program
6304126 look at the deacs with their little suites they have miniature chairs and everything i just want to pinch their cheeks and take them home with me
6304127 its almost a to scale replica of what we added to one of our end zones
6304128 i dont know if they were going for a scale replica of it or a one fourth replica of our actual suites
6304129 a lot of people said mark and i wouldnt work out then but we proved them wrong and im looking forward to working side by side with him in the enduros again
6304130 we were on pole in both races and while the results may have gone pear shaped for other reasons everything else went smoothly we had no issues and the working relationship was fine
6304131 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward
6304132 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6304133 both guys know what it takes to win enduro races and look after the car so im confident that if we get a straight run at it we can look after both of those objectives
6304134 our initiative of kiosks for citizens facilitation is the first of its kind in the country which provides multiple facilities at one place and the special award of the state government would help us replicate it in other municipal corporations
6304135 hes got a bit of a strain in his thigh
6304136 its a soft tissue one so if you do try and play and mask it with a jab or anti inflammatory injections you can do more damage so certainly weve got to look after david
6304137 its just a precaution and we want to make sure hes going to be fit for next week and by playing he might do more damage to the thigh so its important we look after him
6304138 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6304139 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
6304140 the results are quite frankly disappointing we will have to chart a new course over the coming months to get heijmans back on track this will however require outlays before benefits can be reaped
6304141 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6304142 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6304143 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6304144 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6304145 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6304146 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6304147 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6304148 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6304149 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6304150 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6304151 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6304152 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6304153 de resultaten vallen ronduit tegen we zullen de komende maanden de bakens moeten verzetten om heijmans uit het slop te halen helaas zullen daarbij de kosten voor de baten uitgaan
6304154 this purchase marks an important turning point in the development of all of our projects in sweden and finland not only is it the first concrete step towards buying what we need to develop our projects it also reinforces what we have been saying all along that there are many areas where we expect to be able to reduce capital costs and optimize the project economics through timely sourcing of quality used equipment
6304155 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6304156 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6304157 i have my son back thanks to your program your after care program is impressive
6304158 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6304159 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6304160 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6304161 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6304162 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
6304163 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
6304164 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
6304165 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
6304166 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
6304167 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
6304168 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6304169 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
6304170 wir haben wirklich eine deutsche sportlerin bei den olympischen spielen die geht
6304171 wer gehen mal ausprobiert hat wei dass man die technik nicht auf anhieb beherrscht und dass es auch gar nicht so einfach oder komisch ist wie es vielleicht aussieht
6304172 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6304173 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann w rden die leute viel mehr ahnung haben und auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand
6304174 genauso professionell wie ein fu baller tennisspieler oder 100 meter l ufer aber geher stehen nicht so im mittelpunkt
6304175 aber wenn ein weitspringer bertritt gilt der sprung auch nicht und der geher wird ja vorher auch mehrfach gewarnt
6304176 man kann so viele verwarnungen bekommen wie man will aber entscheidend sind die antr ge bei drei antr gen ist schluss die m ssen aber von drei verschiedenen wettkampfrichtern gegeben werden
6304177 wenn man einmal mitgemacht hat will man immer wieder hin die ganze welt schaut zu alle sportarten finden zusammen statt das ist was ganz besonderes man hat die chance sich die anderen disziplinen anzuschauen
6304178 im olympischen dorf muss man die olympiakleidung des landes tragen dadurch erkennt man sich das ist toll man lernt so viele leute kennen und ist nie alleine
6304179 die spitze kann zeiten gehen da k nnen wir trainieren so viel wir wollen
6304180 ich hoffe dass die gro e bombe platzt und wir unsere chance bekommen
6304181 die spitze kann zeiten gehen da k nnen wir trainieren so viel wir wollen ich kann es nicht fassen das ist einfach nur traurig
6304182 ich hoffe dass die gro e bombe platzt und wir unsere chance bekommen
6304183 die russin kommt aus einer trainingsgruppe wo die h lfte gedopt ist
6304184 wir m ssen berlegen lohnt sich das alles noch berhaupt
6304185 da habe ich absolut keine chance 1 27 stunden ist das absolute maximum was ich erreichen kann
6304186 so lange doping kontrolleure keinen diplomatenstatus bekommen brauchen solche leute gar nicht an den start zu gehen
6304187 bei olympia kann man nur von gewonnen reden wenn man eine medaille holt
6304188 the few weve quoted in the past two years have been so outrageously priced that the business owners ran screaming from the room
6304189 but if you havent been able to get insurance elsewhere it is a good thing
6304190 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6304191 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6304192 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6304193 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6304194 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6304195 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6304196 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6304197 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6304198 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6304199 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6304200 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6304201 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6304202 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6304203 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6304204 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6304205 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6304206 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6304207 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6304208 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6304209 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6304211 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6304212 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6304213 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6304214 the need to revise downwards our profit forecast for the year was very disappointing
6304215 however we are encouraged to have exceeded our prospectus revenue forecast by almost 10 per cent re affirming the scale and reach of the brierty business and the opportunity for future growth
6304216 it is also pleasing that the issues that led to the revised profit guidance were fully contained and accounted for in the 2008 financial year giving brierty a clear run at profit growth in 2009
6304217 briertys mining and infrastructure divisions in particular are well placed to capitalise on favourable market conditions
6304218 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6304219 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6304220 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6304221 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6304222 un m vil slider con mp3 gps y mucho m s de sony ericsson
6304223 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6304224 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6304225 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

6304238 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6304239 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6304240 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6304241 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6304242 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6304243 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6304244 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6304245 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6304246 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6304247 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6304248 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6304249 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6304250 this is a planning took where all things are going
6304251 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6304252 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6304253 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6304254 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6304255 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6304256 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6304257 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6304258 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6304259 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6304260 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6304261 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6304262 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6304263 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6304264 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6304265 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6304266 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6304267 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6304268 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6304269 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6304270 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6304271 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6304272 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6304273 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6304274 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6304275 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6304276 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6304277 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6304278 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6304279 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6304280 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6304281 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6304282 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6304283 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6304284 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6304285 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6304286 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6304287 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6304288 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6304289 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6304290 i am begged to wear an aids ribbon a breast cancer ribbon a marie curie flower you name it from the red cross to the rnib they send me stuff to wear to raise awareness and i dont and in those terms and those terms alone i do not and will not wear a poppy
6304291 additionally there is a rather unpleasant breed of poppy fascism out there he damned well must wear a poppy well i do in my private life but i am not going to wear it or any other symbol on air
6304292 i cant publicly promote all of the causes that i am asked to support so i will not support any of them
6304293 you see i cant come in the afternoon because im working maybe you should order some more
6304294 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6304295 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6304296 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6304297 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6304298 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6304299 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6304300 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6304301 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6304302 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6304303 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6304304 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6304305 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6304306 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6304307 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6304308 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6304309 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6304310 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6304311 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6304312 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6304313 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6304314 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6304315 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6304316 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6304317 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6304318 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6304319 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6304320 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6304321 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6304322 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6304323 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6304324 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6304325 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6304326 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6304327 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6304328 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6304329 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6304330 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6304331 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6304332 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6304333 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6304334 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6304335 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6304336 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6304337 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6304338 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6304339 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6304340 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6304341 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6304342 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6304343 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6304344 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6304345 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6304346 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6304347 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6304348 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6304349 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6304350 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6304351 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6304352 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6304353 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6304354 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6304355 you are an absolute pleasure to work with makes web design an absolute blast you are very professional but more important patient thanks
6304356 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6304357 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6304358 la lenteur de la r action du commandement et de s rieux probl mes de coordination
6304359 there appears to be a tendency for public stations to discourage music programming in favor of news talk broadcasts as a way to draw larger audiences
6304360 should balance its drive for audiences and revenues with a commitment to cultural programming and services that are not necessarily profitable
6304361 we have to fish where the fish are weve made some strategic choices
6304362 culture is still a critical part of our public service mission but how we do that is going to change
6304363 its a mystery to me why the nea isnt applauding these moves
6304364 one need not overly focus on the idiosyncracies of making a perfect final sports betting art piece but instead on making foundation work solid and easy to discern
6304365 the most thorough manner to approach sports betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
6304366 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6304367 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6304368 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6304369 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6304370 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6304371 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6304372 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6304373 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6304374 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6304375 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6304376 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6304377 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6304378 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6304379 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6304380 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6304381 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6304382 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals

6304385 most murders happen close to the killers home but not in the area directly surrounding a criminals house where crimes are less likely to be committed because of the fear of getting caught by someone they know
6304386 his concerns were at the heart of the reforms that touched and revolutionised family and social life in britain in the 1960s and 1970s the acceptance of homosexuality divorce and family planning although he also interested himself in a great range of other social issues including abortion prisons and more recently in vitro fertilisation
6304387 the politician social reformer writer and lawyer leo abse who has died aged 91 was a unique figure in the public life of our time he reflected and transmitted in grandiloquent style the paradoxes of our age along with his own egocentric capacity to express often in pyrotechnic rhetoric the contradictions and absurdities in all our lives he was a leftwing socialist with a disraelian quality of showmanship and a product of a welsh jewish idealism oft times coated with celtic imagery always laced with a jewish romanticism he sought pointlessly to disguise
6304388 abse was the first mp to initiate debates on genetic engineering the dangers of nuclear power generation at windcsale and in vitro pregnacies and he campaigned to change the law which made attempted suicide a criminal act he made a special study of the problems of delinquency divorce and counselling it was due to him that the law was changed in the divorce reform act of 1969 to allow divorce after a marriage had broken down beyond repair he despised the system of having to secure a divorce by a bogus admission of adultery or couples being compelled to remain married in name he also saw that the interests of the child were made a prior consideration in divorce settlements perhaps his best known achievements however were piloting through the house of commons the homosexual law reform bill in 1967 and sponsoring what eventually became the 1975 childrens act
6304389 abses approach was to study the relationship between politics and personality he dared to place under scrutiny the interior lives of practising politicians he insisted this had nothing to do with cheap and scurrilous probing but related to the belief that when political decision making can have such fateful consequences as peace or war for a nation the elected politician cannot claim the same right of privacy as that afforded to the electors policies for abse cannot be disengaged from the policy makers the drives and psychological needs of the politicians invade and distort the panaceas they offer to the electorates if more objective assessments are to be made of policies assessments must be made of the men and women who expound them abse himself deserved to be remembered as one of the most significant social reformers of 20th century britain

6304398 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6304399 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6304400 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6304401 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6304430 brits are simply not proactive or spontaneous during their bank holidays preferring to lounge around the house or catch up on some rest the fact that we dont do anything on bank holidays could well reflect this lack of national purpose

6304435 china will surpass the united states as the worlds largest economy in as little as 20 years
6304436 let me get out of my academic dress and come to the gym to cycle
6304437 you know the indian government has done the most senseless act by deciding to ban futures trading in a few commodities it is crazy how can you rein in inflation in your country by banning the commodity futures market
6304438 inflation affects everyone not just india we pay the same price for copper in several countries india is not getting any worse than other countries the problem with india is that your politicians are worse than american politicians you know indian politicians believe and argue that the cause for inflation is commodities trading how absurd is that
6304439 it is the same tactic that politicians have done for hundreds of years everywhere in the world
6304440 commodity prices are still up and up india needs to understand that there is no easy solution to high prices as prices go up people use less of anything and people would continue to produce more and that has always been there in the boom market
6304441 yes i am worried i have been telling this for some years that america was beginning to be hit with recession that the oil price would skyrocket that the us federal reserve does not have any idea to tackle the situation
6304442 recession hard times sliding dollar and inflation and the us fed chairman ben bernankes decision to print huge amounts of money does not help the situation
6304443 you know the current recession is the worst one that we are witnessing since world war ii
6304444 i am still upbeat on china the best thing is that the chinese understood that their market was overheated and they took action before it got into a bubble the correction is not yet over in china but i have plans to invest in chinese commodities and stocks
6304445 india is a fascinating country with the most diverse culture in the world for anyone who wants to travel to any nation i would first suggest india but as an investment destination i would say i would not invest in india for the time being the indian market is overheated and overpriced that is why it has come crashing to these levels these days and after all these years it is really stupid that foreign funds and investors cannot put in money in indian commodities added to the misery of the fact that your government goes on banning futures trading in commodities
6304446 india has the most beautiful women and the worst bureaucrats and politicians in the world
6304447 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6304448 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6304449 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6304450 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6304451 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6304452 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6304453 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6304454 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6304455 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6304456 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6304465 this is the olympics there isnt room for im not sure if you have doubt get out
6304466 this olympic experience is over and can never be mine
6304467 my bags got lost again it was a bit of a worry because i have a special olympics outfit to wear but luckily they arrived today
6304468 i settled into the chair and miss green stabbed me in the arm
6304469 when i say stabbed i mean freddie cougar has nothing on greenie
6304470 after the first stab she quickly realised she didnt get enough out of the war wound she had created and zoned in on my left arm
6304471 at that moment just as she was about to slash my left arm javier gomez one of his triathlon rivals walks into the room

6304515 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6304516 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6304517 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism

6304524 our australian and new zealand businesses remain the cornerstone of our operations in asia pacific and central to our future growth ambition for the region
6304525 having reviewed all of the options available to us through our global operations i am confident that the strategy being recommended today is the right option to meet our future needs at the same time allowing us to capitalise on the efficiencies and capability available to us from within our australian and new zealand manufacturing operations
6304526 in order to compete in the extremely competitive confectionery sector in the future we need to make changes now
6304527 when implemented these changes would reduce complexity remove duplication and improve capacity allowing us to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs
6304528 we understand that this is a very difficult time for some of our employees we have a long history of supporting our employees whenever we need to make changes to the business and if the proposal proceeds we will ensure every affected employee receives their full redundancy entitlements as well as comprehensive career planning and support services
6304529 but today was devastating walking in and seeing all the supplies
6304530 im hopeful that people will want to help the girls out and make the burden a little less
6304531 for kids to come in our building and take our supplies its a disgrace so hopefully they dont come back
6304532 while the legislature did not go as far as i would have liked to cover all children with health insurance i believe modest but solid gains were made toward that goal
6304533 a couple of lines for a speech at the democratic national convention
6304534 rather his focus as it always has been is on getting meaningful legislation passed to give 50 thousand uninsured children access to health care and provide relief to working families who are struggling because of high gas prices
6304535 if its private property take it if it dies tax it but if its american oil leave it in the ground
6304536 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
6304537 the situation here on ground is that essential commodities have started getting dried up diesel is already out of stock and petrol at its verge of end the people here are very much concerned as if the same continues for next few days there will be nothing left to eat with the people of kashmir and on the other side the army is supporting the mobs who have allegedly beaten up the drivers stranded on the national highway the drivers who were beaten up reported that they asked army to help them but all went in despair and the army people in return handed them over to the mobs the target is only the kashmiri muslims and some sources from jammu say that it is the outsiders who have come to jammu and are doing such attacks on the muslims and it is quite evident that the hindu fundamentalist groups viz bjp rss vhp etc are all sponsoring the planned attacks onto the kashmiris like it was done in gujarat here in kashmir we feel the history seems to be being repeated by the hindu fundamentalists who had earlier in 1947 killed about 250 000 muslims in jammu
6304538 this was designed to compensate for those which makes me expect that it probably is going to have more uniform results the approach to disease is becoming more and more uniform on a national level so youd kind of expect it to come out even
6304539 the expectation is that the quality of care delivered throughout the state should be excellent no matter where you are or what hospital you go to
6304540 to me the most important aspect of all of this is the whole concept of transparency in that we ought to be speaking honestly within institutions and across the country about how do we get the right care for the right patient at the right time every time
6304541 if i said a person was blond as opposed to brunette that tells you something but id have to tell you a lot more to pick him out of a crowd
6304542 weve had to make some severe budget cuts to balance this budget
6304543 if the company were to fold all of those organizations the orchestra would struggle or feel the pain also
6304544 a very serious impact on us obviously it is a great deal of money and we dont have a plan in place to offset that loss
6304545 its something wed rather not do because it adds so much to the performance
6304546 although the companys artistic leadership and product have never been better the administrative leadership has not kept pace
6304547 it is unfortunate they feel that way because both venues allow more people in the dallas area to enjoy the ballet at affordable prices
6304548 the majestic theater has consistently lost money assisting the ballet because we felt it was a better venue for them and they must have agreed because they were here for the last six years
6304549 our mantra now is to have 2 million in pledges by the middle of september
6304550 i have it by my phone to remind me of that goal every day
6304551 all i need is a kiss and thatll make it worthwhile
6304552 i didnt complain we were sneaking into an area we werent supposed to be
6304553 make use of that which is available at your disposal and bend it to suit your needs
6304554 the students islamic movement of india has been experimenting with a new concotion using hydrogen peroxide to make liquid bombs prototypes of liquid bombs were first experimented in vagamon hill resort in kerala where a simi camp was held in december 2007 to impart terror training to its cadres the camp was organised by kerala simi secretary p a shivli experiments with hydrogen peroxide were revealed in the statement of simi general secretary safdar nagori during interrogation after his arrest by the indore police on march 26 this year
6304555 but today was devastating walking in and seeing all the supplies
6304556 im hopeful that people will want to help the girls out and make the burden a little less
6304557 for kids to come in our building and take our supplies its a disgrace so hopefully they dont come back
6304558 weve been getting joe around the state and now that this groundwork has been laid hell have stronger financial support in later reports
6304559 dont forget they laughed at carol shea porter who spent a paltry sum but she had powerful issues and grass roots support on her side
6304560 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6304561 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help
6304562 the three party alliance would hold a meeting this morning to form the new cabinet as the parties have reached closer to a consensus
6304563 i am relieved that the csb heeded our call to proceed with an investigation of this tragic accident
6304564 workplace accidents are far too common and we must ensure we dont make the same mistakes twice when hazardous materials are involved today we have learned that a pressure relief system error likely caused the loss of a life which should be a wake up call to companies operating similar equipment
6304565 in texas we are grateful to the csb for their important work following the bp texas city explosion in 2005
6304566 i look forward to working with the csb leadership to ensure that they have all the necessary resources and authority to do their job which is essential to worker safety in texass chemical industry
6304567 would likely focus on the companys practices for managing inspecting and maintaining relief systems training operators and accounting for workers during emergencies

6304569 as someone who works in a medical library and as someone fascinated by search engines and who wishes well to worthwhile innovation in search i have a few suggestions for how search engines and web 2 0 entrepreneurs generally can spread the word about their tools to librarians doing so is good business librarians tend to spend hours searching they deal with the public and key players in corporate settings and they read blogs by other librarians and pass along news of what they find on such blogs via email or list servers
6304570 for instance i have had some mutually productive interactions with various search engine developers i have read about here they seem to have benefited from my free input and it makes sense to have expert eyes look at your stuff and critique it i am no expert but many librarians are very sophisticated astute analysts of search technologies after all many of the leading lights in the search world e g gary price tara calishain greg notess and mary ellen bates are either former librarians or very much listened to by librarians who attend gatherings such as internet librarian and computers in libraries consider attending those conferences either as individuals just to get a feel for them or as a sponsor of a booth you would stand out given that we librarians are quite used to seeing the old standbys such as ebsco h w wilson and gale web 2 0 is surprisingly underrepresented at tech oriented gatherings in the vendor arena
6304571 i want a corporate officer here so that it is clear what his obligations are
6304572 he shall appear here next week aug 27 at 10 oclock
6304573 there was a miscommunication today between lawsons counsel and the u s attorneys office that has been addressed and mr neri will be in attendance as requested at the next hearing
6304574 our first interest is in their physical mental well being
6304575 we have obviously the luxury of the suspects being in custody they werent going anywhere before this and now theyre certainly not going anywhere
6304576 there was a number of cuts and quite a bit of blood according to people who were there
6304577 how do i get out of here where do these keys go to
6304578 we think it was made out of a piece of allowed property that they use to heat soup and water with
6304579 the assault was going on when she stepped off the elevator
6304580 they saw her come off the elevator and they jumped her
6304581 i think they both tried to get in the elevator and an inmate went in there with them
6304582 they all got in there and wrestled around these are young scrapper guys theyre well fit and i think they must have held their own
6304583 not only did they not get off the floor they were on they had absolutely no chance of breathing fresh air
6304584 there were multiple levels of security once notified central security would stop all elevator traffic in the building stairwells are locked from the outside
6304585 what we have begged for the last four years is to increase the number of separation cells a larger cell where one inmate is kept by himself and included in that enclosure is additional square footage and a shower unit
6304586 now the use of separation cells is a very rare exception and almost a jail management luxury
6304587 when the new jail is built they will be routinely used for this type of inmate
6304588 when theyre not in those four corners of the cell is when theyre the most dangerous
6304589 we all have to look at different ways of maintaining costs we have to tell the community exactly whats going on
6304590 they will definitely spend less in the lunchroom to maintain a budget that will allow the children to do the things they want to do
6304591 everybody who participates in the food industry everyone along the line is trying to cover their costs
6304592 against wider perception pawnbroking is not overall a cyclical business and the weaker economic climate is not necessarily a driver for our business
6304593 it is undeniably one of the most desirable locations for residential property in the emirate perfect for investors looking to benefit from the ongoing dubai property boom
6304594 i think john king our chief executive and his management team have done a great job in repositioning house of fraser in what can only be described as difficult trading times
6304595 we are pleased with our performance over the six months
6304596 errorkey is the tool you need to quickly get an answer for errors you encounter we first implemeted errorkey as an in house application to help us in our work by quickly get resolution to errors after sharing it with a group of friends hackers like us we got good feedback and decided to make it available to the public
6304597 when that olympic flag is passed to london this weekend it should act as the trigger for north west companies to bid for the contracts on offer
6304598 theres still plenty of time to act and theres still plenty of opportunity
6304599 we want to work with the best of businesses in the north west large and small to deliver the venues and infrastructure for the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games and create a lasting legacy it is a challenging project and we are on track
6304600 creating a level playing field to ensure we get the best of business is an important part of this and companies in the region are showing an en couraging appetite to be part of this once in a lifetime opportunity
6304601 we have had representations from some of our members who say that the online method of bidding is unnecessarily intrusive and difficult to follow
6304602 in order to be eligible to tender for work companies need to report on gender and racial equality and offer trade union membership to employees
6304603 most smes have fewer than 10 staff and the process of acquiring all the necessary information is frankly putting them off
6304604 theres immense potential for north west companies to capitalise on the 2012 olympics but the whole process needs to be streamlined
6304605 i think that for most companies the chance to play a role in the 2012 olympics is all about the prestige of being linked to the event
6304606 we hope to play a role in the design for one of the buildings linked to the main stadium and if we were successful we would look at the opportunity of opening another office down in london and expanding our team
6304607 the contract win would obviously be a terrific help at this moment in time as the credit crunch takes effect
6304608 gt here for an overview of the forum and the participants posts
6304609 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6304610 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6304611 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6304612 on this issue we fully support russia the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6304613 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so
6304614 just because you have a bilingual program doesnt mean youre off the hook that program still has to provide equal educational opportunities and remove impediments to language barriers
6304615 its not just enough to throw money at it and say ok weve done our part
6304616 you have a lot of educators these days under a lot of stress
6304617 with a more punitive approach to punishing failing schools theres a lot a lot more animosity among the community
6304618 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6304619 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6304620 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe
6304621 they have had all these cuts they are so understaffed that if they were to do anything its only spot checks and only minimal things theyre able to do instead of an agency which can provide assistance and positive support they become reduced to this watchdog group
6304622 bilingual and ell english language learners programs are locally implemented
6304623 we do go and follow up to make sure each district is in compliance but the actual implementation is a local issue
6304624 the fact that there are no latino board members on u 46 indicates that the issues latino children and their parents are facing may not have a voice
6304625 present to the school board the perspective of english language learners of limited english students with problems in regards to services
6304626 were really looking at how its working comparing ourselves with other districts seeing if students are successfully transitioning into english classes
6304627 well certainly be interested in seeing what the u 46 lawsuits outcome is
6304628 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
6304629 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spin offs
6304630 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
6304631 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
6304632 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
6304633 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
6304634 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want
6304635 manufacturers are becoming more downbeat about forthcoming levels of activity but are still having to raise their prices due to the severity of recent cost increases
6304636 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
6304637 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
6304638 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
6304639 we would support changes to the vat system to encourage the use of sustainable materials and the repair of existing products
6304640 however we dont want companies who are unable to use sustainable materials to be punished
6304641 raising vat rates on certain materials would simply put another burden on businesses at a time when economic conditions are becoming harder
6304642 oprah now ive read in your book that you said if i just replaced coffee with green tea instead that i could lose 10 pounds in six weeks dr perricone absolutely oprah now really how could that what is the big deal about this dr perricone coffee has organic acids that raise your blood sugar raise insulin insulin puts a lock on body fat when you switch over to green tea you get your caffeine youre all set but you will drop your insulin levels and body fat will fall very rapidly so 10 pounds in six weeks i will guarantee it oprah im gonna do that ok that is so good whoo that is great
6304643 success is liking yourself liking what you do and liking how you do it
6304644 were definitely looking i wouldnt be honest with you if i said we werent
6304645 were talking to a lot of people were investigating a lot of players around the world and were going to strongly look into doing that we have something special here we have a good team chemistry we dont want to rock the boat either
6304646 we have been playing and practicing without her for the past six weeks were not going to surf into unchartered waters weve played without her we know what thats like
6304647 i think well just go back to how we were doing the last five games without jackson and what worked for us and what didnt work for us and learn from that
6304648 the last eight games are going to be big for us we have a lot to play for we are playing a lot of teams in the playoff hunt and we are in the playoff hunt so weve got to move forward
6304649 was sicher ist sie starben in einem hinterhalt wie wildtiere

6304654 hintergrund ist dass die terroristischen aktivit ten immer st rker von pakistan auf afghanistan ausstrahlen und die taliban dort ihr aufmarsch und r ckzugsgebiet haben das bereitet mir gro e sorgen vor allem mit blick auf die grenze afghanistan pakistan dort gehen in bestimmten regionen t glich 60 000 menschen unkontrolliert ber die grenze
6304655 es zeichnet sich ab dass die usa ihren kampf gegen den internationalen terrorismus deshalb nach pakistan verlagern wollen ziehen sie dabei mit
6304656 wir m ssen pakistans grenzen respektieren aber entschieden auf eine l sung des grenzproblems dringen pakistan muss den anti terror kampf st rker unterst tzen
6304657 halten sie einen isaf einsatz in pakistan f r notwendig
6304658 das steht nicht zur diskussion aber abgesehen davon ginge das nicht ohne zustimmung pakistans und ein mandat der vereinten nationen
6304659 unterst tzen sie den einsatz von awacs aufkl rungsflugzeugen ber afghanistan
6304660 erwarten sie widerstand im bundestag f r ein neues isaf mandat
6304661 ich hoffe dass wir ber die mehrheit der gro en koalition hinaus daf r zustimmung finden dem letzten isaf mandat haben auch gr ne und fdp abgeordnete zugestimmt
6304662 themenwechsel kaukasus bundeskanzlerin angela merkel hat die aufnahme georgiens in die nato zugesagt stehen sie dazu
6304663 ich denke es ist gut dass wir neben der seit jahren bestehenden nato ukraine kommission jetzt auch rasch eine nato georgien kommission einrichten

6304665 a series of truces at local and national level produced by informal talks between hamid karzais government with the taliban and its islamist ally gulbuddin hekmatyar appear to be holding for the time being

6304669 i have been interested in science since i was a little girl
6304670 growing up i knew i wanted to do something with animals it was my dream
6304671 so in 1999 i decided that i wanted to try something different
6304672 i then went on to finish my biology degree at asu augusta state university and decided that i wanted to teach
6304673 i enjoy the challenge of keeping my students motivated and showing them that studying science is something that is relevant to their life and it can be fun i also enjoy helping them think about the future
6304674 for a lot of them it opens up a career path once they realize what is all involved with studying biology
6304675 they need to know that they have an advocate who is really concerned for their well being and is proud of them when they do good and will get on them when they arent doing what they should
6304676 that genuine concern helps to keep them going and it shows that teachers have an effect you may not know it day to day but when you watch them mature and develop into adults its very rewarding
6304677 shes an excellent teacher she brings a lot of enthusiasm to the classroom and has a good rapport with the kids
6304678 she makes the lessons meaningful and relevant to her students

6304695 one of the things that makes this church unique is its gothic style carpentry which is rare in augusta
6304696 even with the renovations the sanctuary is almost unchanged from when it was first built
6304697 the church has agreed to make the sanctuary available to the public for suitable events

6304700 its more engaging especially for school groups when you have a theaterlike atmosphere and its a good way for them to get specialized information
6304701 each of the films relates to the history of the csra in some way
6304702 they are documentary style films so its like seeing history in motion
6304703 these are really good ways for everyone not just school groups to learn more about history in a unique way

6304708 i had to dig deep if i can get through those kind of matches i can get through anything
6304709 the thing im most proud of this year is that ive remained consistent throughout
6304710 my goal was to break the top 50 ive done that the rest of the year is bonus for me
6304711 joy satisfaction its been a busy summer we worked so hard its nice to see its paying off
6304712 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president i was sixty two years old when i made the decision and i thought it was my one shot at the prize
6304713 we find children connect better with the puppets than in a one on one briefing
6304714 i see this as another vehicle or tool to reach families
6304715 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security
6304716 if you leave those people the method of the taliban or of the al qaeda is to come in and exact a punishment
6304717 what happens when you come back is that theres not a level of trustworthiness that youve had there among the people because you did this once before
6304718 when we leave they will either go back to being farmers or will be killed
6304719 as long as someone is there someone who represents the government or represents security to the people i think well be ok the question is who and to what degree
6304720 we are undermanned in order to be able to do all we need to do in the south
6304721 but dont you dare suggest i am less patriotic than you or i have political motivations in taking the positions i take
6304722 im skinny but im tough we will hit back hard with the truth we will answer any lies that are made and we intend to win this election
6304723 we cant have the same kind of shoot first and aim second approach in our foreign policy weve got to have some kind of judgment in our foreign policy and restore our alliances around the world
6304724 tendency is to shoot first and to ask questions later
6304725 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war in iraq that had nothing to do with 9 11
6304726 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6304727 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6304728 and the republicans havent been very good at governing but theyre very good at running negative ads
6304729 its important we strip away all the political nonsense and just understand whats at stake in this election
6304730 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i am questioning his patriotism
6304731 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6304732 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6304733 uma viola o flagrante da constitui o da lei de expropria o e de outras leis da venezuela

6304735 we usually have about 1 000 crowns working at one time
6304736 we have dentists over there who take care of patients
6304737 ive always wanted to play him but another reason was i picked up in the community a certain prejudice against youth theater i wanted to add to our core audience and i thought doing an adult show might attract people who might not have otherwise come
6304738 its good for them to see adults to see me doing the work running lines learning dance steps
6304739 ultimately the report will play an important role in the nsw liberals nationals consideration of the privatisation legislation the joint statement said
6304740 the requirement that the auditor general report to parliament on the detail of the proposed privatisation was one of the nsw liberal nationals five community safeguards

6304742 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6304743 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6304744 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6304745 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6304746 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6304747 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads
6304748 i dont think well start panicking at all i dont think its time to panic i just think its time to keep learning keep getting better watch the film and correct our mistakes and keep moving forward not taking steps backward
6304749 if you ask someone to name all the phone numbers you can off the top of your head its going to be pretty interesting
6304750 when i asked the singer to name all of the phone numbers she knew it was fascinating it was her dads office from 20 years ago or a friends number in florence you can tease narrative out of anything on wikipedia there are these lists of things like list of horrible ethnic slurs or list of famous canadian homosexuals thats such a poignant way to organize the world
6304751 weve got sampling keyboards and a lot of screaming ill be brushing my friends hair onstage it all works out
6304752 weve all known each other since the dawn of time and we all have a very flexible musical intelligence its like cooking at your moms house you know where everything is
6304753 its not easy i knew this day was going to come but it seems it just came too fast
6304754 most students want their parents to move them in and leave but students should probably let their parents stick around for a little bit and let them adjust
6304755 the worst thing they can do is sit in their room and not participate in activities
6304756 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6304757 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6304758 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said
6304759 after taking advice from my supporters and friends i have decided to resign in the best interests of the nation
6304760 but middle class families are also affected and according to a june 2008 survey 86 percent of pakistanis find it increasingly difficult to afford flour on a daily basis for which they blame their government
6304761 be prepared to be bombed be prepared to go back to the stone age
6304762 where the government says more than 460 insurgents and 22 troops have died in 10 days of fighting
6304763 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6304764 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6304765 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6304766 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6304767 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6304768 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6304769 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6304770 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6304771 well yeah he did try to hang himself shortness of breath is kind of the goal there isnt it
6304772 its do bad he didnt do a better job of hanging himself he could have saved the taxpayers some money on his hospital bill
6304773 but then his family would have sued sheriff joe for another forty million bucks
6304774 we were inspired to lead an effort to unravel the realities and fictions that surround the subject matter
6304775 one of the hallmarks of a good museum is an interest in establishing and sustaining a public dialogue about matters of importance

6304782 la actitud de la derecha de tener una decisi n tomada de antemano de rechazar el proyecto que subsidia el transporte p blico es una maniobra pol tica electoral que hoy ha quedado de manifiesto en la comisi n
6304783 se ha enga ado porque se dan datos que no ciertos se ha iniciado una campa a de desprestigiado en contra de los parlamentarios en regiones y se han usado hasta malas artes para lograr los votos de los diputados de la concertaci n

6304812 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6304813 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6304814 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6304815 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6304816 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6304817 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6304818 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said

6304870 the company is certainly fairly well placed to share the profits with the workers who helped achieve these profits
6304871 this was why it was decided to trial a model with a small but representative number of pacific island countries which is designed carefully to maximise the chances of success

6304878 present day conditions call loudly for a new examination and new presentation of gods omnipotency gods sufficiency gods sovereignty
6304879 who is filled with benevolent intentions yet unable to carry them out
6304880 is earnestly desirous of blessing men but they will not let him
6304881 the devil has gained the upper hand and that god is to be pitied rather than blamed
6304882 has far more to do with the affairs on earth than god has
6304883 are your thoughts concerning this world and gods relation to it based upon what you see
6304884 our thoughts are formed and our actions regulated our lives moulded by the holy scriptures
6304885 principally teach what man is to believe concerning god and what duty god requires of man
6304886 worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
6304887 of him and through him and to him are all things
6304888 nothing can successfully resist him still lest overthrow his counsel and because god is omniscient no problem can master him and no difficulty baffle his wisdom
6304889 in view of his inflexible justice and immaculate holiness we could not expect anything other than what is now before our eyes
6304890 rejoice always pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
6304891 well what solutions does the left bring to the party now in georgia weve seen how earnestly putin amp co take negotiations and cease fire agreements how carefully the russians observe un resolutions and international law what measures should we take to remove russias boot from georgias neck send yet another diplomat or publicity hound senator theyve done a great job in darfur
6304892 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
6304893 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6304894 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6304895 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6304896 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6304897 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6304898 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6304899 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6304900 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6304901 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6304902 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6304903 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6304904 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6304905 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6304906 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6304907 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6304908 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6304909 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6304910 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6304911 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6304912 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6304913 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6304914 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6304915 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6304916 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6304917 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6304918 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6304919 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6304920 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6304921 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6304922 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6304923 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6304924 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6304925 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6304926 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6304927 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6304928 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
6304929 aqu est la mentira que si uno explota el rtico y la costa baja el precio de la gasolina

6304977 but not as deceitful as a low down dirty deceiver
6304978 im baffled why this issue is blown out of proportion the public gave them mandate to rule but they just keep digging dirt and blaming the previous government
6304979 why do they harp on the rm40 million as if we have already lost it when we are still fighting in court to reduce damages
6304980 heh i used to do these when i was a kid

6304996 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
6304997 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
6304998 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
6304999 this incremental investment is motivated by strong customer demand for integration of suse linux and windows

6305048 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6305049 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6305050 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6305053 this is behaviour in childhood you would expect people with these personality disorders to have graduated onto crimes against the person once they reached adulthood children are very limited in scope as to who they can abuse it has to be either animals or other children
6305054 there are trends that are of concern to us such as people filming cruelty on mobile phones but thats not to say that the behaviour didnt happen before it just wasnt recorded before and this is very quickly detectable as well because as soon as it gets out of the very small circle of people directly involved we tend to find out about it
6305055 it used to be an activity for people who were very into dog fighting who prided themselves on having the most macho dog coming from a strong lineage of champions you know the champion of champions there was a hard core of about 100 people involved in this country it was very underground and it tended to be people involved in other criminal activities as well
6305056 now were seeing more hard kids on street corners using their hard looking dog to intimidate people this is predominantly in urban areas among young people there seems to be an increase on that level where maybe rival gangs are having their dogs fight its less structured certainly
6305057 people look at toy dogs in magazines and think that looks cute that would look nice in my handbag too whereas instead they should think can i care for this animal properly is it the right animal for the lifestyle i lead can i afford to look after it can i afford vets bills dogs simply should not be used as symbols of macho pride or hyper femininity theyre animals theyre sentient beings that need care

6305072 the kind of stress in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6305073 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6305074 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6305075 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6305076 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war

6305092 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6305093 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6305094 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s
6305095 bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people
6305096 if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6305097 in a life or death situation you never know how youre going to react in that situation
6305098 we had two indians come down the trail and they were warning everyone of a flash flood
6305099 we drew lines in the sand to watch the water and see how fast it would rise up
6305100 we really only had three to five minutes to get all of our stuff together and get on the tables
6305101 it rose about six inches and then it went back down
6305102 its the middle of the night and youre in the middle of a river inside of a flash flood
6305103 theres a point where ya think if it rise six inches to a foot past this im going to have to jump off and fight for my life and thats a pretty scary moment
6305104 he was very surprised when he found us he thought we were going to be dead
6305105 a life or death scenario and we conquered it and kicked ass

6305107 gsm global system for mobile communications was designed from the first day to allow consumers to use any handset they want in the u s the mobile operators mobility in particular have made it clear you can do so im sure there will be subsidized handsets for a long time but more and more people are learning they can have exactly the cell phone they want regardless of whether the operator has decided to sell it
6305108 it has a much more sleek modern feel to it the treo in its day was a pretty cutting edge device in terms of form factor this puts palm back in the game competitively from a design standpoint its using the latest version of windows mobile 6 1 which is a rock solid os for mobile functionality it will appeal to people using it for business as well as consumers who may just be interested in it for personal use
6305109 it looks like a very very solid offering from palm it doesnt come a moment too soon it comes at time when they need to refresh the treo brand as the premium brand relative to the centro
6305110 its not clear if its enough to attract customers relative to competing offerings at some level its a battle between usability and sex appeal the pros improvements are well conceived and reflect a strong voice of the customer design orientation which should at least be enough to keep current aficionados loyal
6305111 this would be a much stronger launch if a carrier was already lined up but more and more companies are entering into this space and offering it as a choice for their customers
6305112 that is a concern for palm since they are the only gms carrier that has a full scale initiative to serve business users
6305113 the at amp t mobility group that focuses on the enterprise is heavily promoting the iphone however there are many obstacles with the iphone in enterprise it would be unfortunate if at amp t had rejected palm in favor of focusing on the iphone and blackberry
6305114 economically its been tough as fair grounds is 370 miles from houston
6305115 ive had to bring in additional staff so that i can stay here through friday and fly to new orleans on saturday for the weekend stakes
6305116 its been a hectic week but on the bright side at least we have these opportunities to run our horses

6305119 we are always encouraged that maxxam horses go on to win graded stakes
6305120 their success is a testament to the quality of the maxxam gold cup fields
6305121 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6305122 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6305123 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6305124 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment
6305125 i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing
6305126 because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation
6305127 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization

6305134 my view is that you either deregulated trading or you dont so if people dont want deregulated trading you either close every door on a sunday and see how people like that but what weve got is an absolute hash of things theres no rhyme or reason to it its all politically driven
6305135 i wasnt sleeping ive been up thinking of presents to buy you
6305136 this is a clear indication of our confidence in the quality and value of our cars and trucks
6305137 were pleased to now offer that same level of confidence with every gm certified used vehicle from buick chevrolet gmc and pontiac and every saturn certified pre owned vehicle as we reach the 3 million sales milestone this warranty enhancement adds a real point of differentiation for our program enabling our dealers to offer customers a range of peace of mind assurances that compare favorably with any other manufacturer certified program in the industry gm certified and saturn certified do an outstanding job of bringing in new gm customers and this enhancement will only add to that

6305139 we take care of our customers by standing behind our cars and trucks with a five year 100 000 mile transferable powertrain warranty plus roadside assistance and courtesy transportation we already provide the best coverage in america and now were making that coverage even better

6305142 ford is a leader in safety and fuel economy not even toyota or honda can match the new escapes safety and fuel efficiency ratings
6305143 ford has more five star rated vehicles than any other automaker and weve committed to lead or be at the top of every segment in which we compete in terms of fuel efficiency
6305144 weve devoted many hours to analyzing and developing the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes
6305145 weve taken our compact suvs to the next level of safety and have achieved better ratings than fierce competitors such as toyota
6305146 safety is a top purchase consideration second only to fuel efficiency so escapes five star crash safety ratings and best in class highway fuel economy i 4 manual are a winning combination
6305147 love of country my friends is another way of saying love of your fellow countryman
6305148 if you find faults with our country make it a better one if you are disappointed with the mistakes of government join its ranks and correct them
6305149 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
6305150 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
6305151 listening is going to become a discipline within every organization
6305152 you dont fight the corporations head to head because their big and theyve got people they have corporate hitmen that work at government levels
6305153 this whole system of private ownership is rotten to the core that a few people owning and controlling all the wealth and the means of making more wealth is totally upside down

6305163 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6305164 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6305165 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6305166 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs
6305167 but things are better here on the gulf coast of mississippi

6305175 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6305176 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6305177 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6305189 or maybe let me take a wild guess here just maybe you confused an 1811 d with an 1811 e
6305190 after the home run i was thinking what if i finish the game with a great catch then i did
6305191 any time you snap one away late like that it feels good
6305192 ive made some adjustments and am playing with more confidence
6305193 this game felt good it gives me more positive thinking
6305194 i could have sent him back out for another one but we just lost two guys in our rotation
6305195 i felt good its a game we should have won
6305196 hes had some big hits lately and theres not many bigger than that
6305197 dude cmon now just reach down and peel your sweaty ass balls off your inner thigh please youre grossing me the fuck out
6305198 down there is where you develop up here its a pennant race if you ask if the decision was right id say it was
6305199 tough situation were in a pennant race and were in boston and a lot of focus is on him and he feels the responsibility
6305200 i think coming into this game we were all excited about watching him pitch but the way it unraveled makes it kind of obvious we had to do something
6305201 instead of going out there and gritting my teeth and say im going to get this guy out i go out there and think whats going to happen next
6305202 against boston youve got to be able to hit with men on base
6305203 youve got to score when you get opportunities to score because you never know if youre going to have enough runs
6305204 it was tough early but he kept us in the game hung on right there and he gave us a chance to come back
6305205 he kind of figured it out a little bit he went through a rough start but he ended up pretty good
6305206 i feel obligated to sleep with her after all the things she buys me she did paid for this entire trip for me and my friend
6305207 all but reached his vp decision while on vacation in hawaii
6305208 the key phrase used twice in the times story is all but and it provides obamas advisers the vast wiggle room in which they can simultaneously assert that he has made up his mind and that he hasnt made up his mind in other words the times has no news to report only a higher octane of speculation it expects its readers to swallow until obama does make his announcement
6305209 as everyone has now heard joe biden has now said hes not the vp pick
6305210 my colleague ann friedman has an interesting post on the history of the douchebag not just as an insult or cleansing device but as an early 20th century contraceptive
6305211 this is incidentally the most fun topic to write about ever
6305212 i think it definitely shows hes strong and capable of throwing about 120 pitches
6305213 actually i didnt think my fastball and location were that great at all
6305214 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6305215 i got my adrenaline flowing around the eighth inning and the defense played great behind me
6305216 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
6305217 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me
6305218 hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord
6305219 god doesnt see as man sees for man looketh on the outward appearance but god looketh on the heart
6305220 not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord of hosts
6305221 you never feel completely comfortable in this ball park but with the wind blowing in today it made it a little easier to pitch to some of the tough guys in the middle of the order
6305222 youre not worrying about the ball going out of the park so easily
6305223 i think i didnt have a good position to the ball
6305224 he hit it on the end and i didnt have a very good jump on the ball
6305225 i thought stuff wise this was one of lillys better games of the year
6305226 i was put in a situation where i had an opportunity to get out of it looking back youd have liked to make a little better pitch to keppinger with two strikes on him
6305227 i mean ideally to get weaker contact thats kind of the game right there that theyre able to get that run
6305228 i pretty much threw the fastball wherever i wanted to when you do that it can make your other pitches better i think i pitched better tonight than i did any time this year it shows me the work im doing is paying off
6305229 he came down and said he thought he was going to take me out
6305230 what he did more than anything else was he stayed out of the middle of the plate so he could keep the ball off the fat part of their bats
6305231 when they did center it up we had someone standing there to catch it
6305232 pitches over the middle of the plate belt high they lead to extra base hits
6305233 its all about starting pitching and tonight our starter had a tough outing
6305234 its been very inconsistent all year long it was a pitch i could always have success with but its not doing much it spins up there stays up over the plate and it gets whacked three of the home runs i gave up tonight were on that pitch
6305235 they know me pretty well i think thats why they were battling me
6305236 there was no inning when i wasnt out of the stretch
6305237 it shows you we can do it a lot of good at bats up and down the lineup
6305238 todd was working real hard so thats a nice cushion to give him it was not an easy game for him
6305239 i need to eat innings and i didnt do that if you just chalk it up a domino effect can happen
6305240 it has nothing to do with the game it doesnt matter how good anybody did at the plate
6305241 there were a few things going through my mind can i go to second
6305242 when i was in the process of going down it was kind of a slow motion effect and im just glad i got back to first
6305243 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6305244 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6305245 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6305246 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6305247 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6305248 he always had good stuff he throws a heavy ball
6305249 as long as i feel good physically i dont see it being an issue
6305250 everything went wrong in the first inning thats the frustrating thing about baseball
6305251 if we make those plays they only get two runs wed still be playing right now
6305252 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6305253 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6305254 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6305255 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6305256 that was definitely a break to move that inning along
6305257 youre going to lose some tough ones but what really matters is what you do after that
6305258 they beat us tonight but we had our opportunities to win the game too again it just indicates we are making progress
6305259 it expires the end of august i better go get a new one soon
6305260 this is so bad for you jamie get out of here
6305261 after giving up a four spot with peavy on the mound you look down and start seeing what bullpen guys can get you through the game
6305262 i knew he didnt want to load the bases and i kinda guessed right
6305263 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs against one of the games best pitchers
6305264 i obviously didnt have good stuff today but i battled and tried to give the guys a chance to come back
6305265 giving up four in the first to him peavy obviously i didnt like my chances
6305266 hes usually in and around the plate especially when he has the lead that wasnt typical jake
6305267 i just didnt have it i couldnt throw the ball where i wanted to throw it i just didnt make pitches thats all there is to it

6305283 i had to pull over to the side of the road and put my head in my hands and say who is this guy
6305284 i scribbled his name on a piece of paper and as soon as i could i ran to the tattered cover book store and bought one of his books started reading everything of his i could and ive been fighting for social justice ever since
6305285 are warmongering psychopathic evil bastards and the democrats are spineless gutless turds and obama is the same corporate shill as mccain
6305286 were supposed to believe that obama is some kind of a radical marxist
6305287 but he doesnt come to our meetings obama is republican light
6305288 they know what it takes theyve been there and they understand what we have to do
6305289 those are two of the leaders in here and your leaders have to step up and thats what theyre doing
6305290 weve been around for a lot of things good times bad times
6305291 we understand theres a sense of urgency but i think everyone understands that
6305292 its our job to go out and try to prove people wrong
6305293 when people think youre out you almost want to prove them wrong more
6305294 when we need him to come up clutch he always does it
6305295 hes a great leader on this team and he leads by example
6305296 i was hitting my spots and where sometimes im missing three or four inches inside i was able to get that ball in there for strikes tonight and get some outs
6305297 he used all of his pitches his curveball and changeup were great tonight he had great location with his fastball and he kept them off balance he got a lot of ground balls and gave us what we needed
6305298 he had some trouble with his control and with a team like the yankees you cant do that
6305299 some days you can be real good some days you can be ok some days you can be terrible and yesterday i was terrible

6305310 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6305311 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6305312 so the next president cant do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster which is appropriately enough an embryonic police state
6305313 efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns
6305314 given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
6305315 increasing the number of children adopted by lesbian gay bisexual transgender lgbt adults

6305321 weve got to make sure that we are doing it in a way that allows us to continue to accelerate
6305322 what weve been talking about recently is making sure we stretch those dollars for four years
6305323 are due to the grave threats to the ancestral territories of the indigenous peoples
6305324 the peruvian state has granted concessions in said territories to oil and gas companies without holding any consultation with the indigenous peoples who inhabit these areas
6305325 tonight we would have had to cut electrical energy to the department of amazonas

6305327 ultimately the report will play an important role in the nsw liberals nationals consideration of the privatisation legislation the joint statement said
6305328 the requirement that the auditor general report to parliament on the detail of the proposed privatisation was one of the nsw liberal nationals five community safeguards
6305329 oh i dont have a problem with drinking but i like to have a good time
6305330 pour a bottle of german babebier in the tub and lie back for a real bubble bath
6305331 simply shake and spirtz after all beer is mostly water
6305332 wow your hair it smells so so will you marry me
6305333 pour some beer on them and wait a few minutes the carbonation may help break up rust
6305334 we really need to come up with a comedy program to lighten the mood of our audience
6305335 sabi niya nga the relevance of teleradyo now dahil sa gumaganda ang viewership kinakailangang i capitalize natin by coming up with a program like this lol and after several months of conceptualization and brainstorming we finally came up with this kind of program
6305336 happy ako at medyo na revive ng konti ang aking career
6305337 alam mo kasi ang pilipinas nasadlak na ang mga tao halos nakasimangot na lahat parang wala ng pag asa bigyan natin ng pag asa makatawa man lang sila at makalimutan nila ang problema kahit for one hour lang ayos na ito
6305338 here we examine the issues and help clarify the controversies
6305339 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage council president greig gailey said
6305340 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6305341 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors mr gailey said
6305342 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years mr swan said
6305343 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6305344 there is a public expectation and there is a government expectation that banks follow the reserve bank mr swan said
6305345 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6305346 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6305347 just as banks put their rates up in a nanosecond when official rates went up they should follow the reserve bank down when official rates come down
6305348 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said
6305349 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6305350 pick up the pieces and go on with your life without me
6305351 i cant even walk outside because somebody is going to come up to you and ask for change
6305352 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6305353 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
6305354 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
6305355 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
6305356 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
6305357 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
6305358 by taking part in this australia wide campaign the people of lithgow can show the rest of the country that we are prepared to stand up and walk for what we believe in
6305359 it is solar and wind powered just in case the pollies need a hint and people power will get it to its final destination in canberra
6305360 if i have seen farther it is by standing on the shoulders of giants
6305361 give me land lots of land neath the starry skies above dont fence me in
6305362 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
6305363 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
6305364 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
6305365 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
6305366 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
6305367 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
6305368 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
6305369 hes doing ok but i am sensing that he is not as encouraged after his last outing sunday in minneapolis as he was his previous outing
6305370 i wouldnt say i am resigned to his not returning but i guess i look at it as being kind of a gravy if he does
6305371 i just grabbed the car keys i just got the car for my son and they were going to tow it
6305372 there is much that needs to be done to get the economy on track
6305373 john mccains jobs for america plan will keep taxes low to create good jobs here in america and give american workers renewed confidence in their economic future
6305374 small businesses are the heart of job growth and raising taxes on them hurts every worker
6305375 at a time when our companies need to be more competitive we need to provide a permanent incentive to innovate and remove the uncertainty now hanging over businesses as they make r amp d investment decisions
6305376 will protect tax cuts for poor and middle class families but he will reverse most of the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers
6305377 mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes almost all of whom would receive large tax cuts that would on average raise their after tax incomes by more than twice the average for all households
6305378 someday when this building is 85 years old and you are about 90 youll look back and say i was there on the very first day it opened
6305379 teachers move those classes you know how to do it
6305380 i cant pick one thing its so beautiful its so spacious
6305381 this is just over the top beautiful everything is just so inviting
6305382 id rather wait two more weeks and get it right than rush it and get it wrong
6305383 but johansen had not given out yet knowing that the thing could surely overtake the
6305384 i certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was 28 percent
6305385 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
6305386 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
6305387 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
6305388 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
6305389 i think i would term this addition through subtraction for monsanto
6305390 did they really need to spend their time defending this product when its not the reason people are buying their stock
6305391 it allows monsanto to focus on its core seeds and traits business

6305395 journalists should actively endorse those politicians candidates for office and special interest groups whose agendas would best serve the overarching goal of reducing social inequality
6305396 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6305397 but they can also be taken away at any time
6305398 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them it just made them go with the action urgently
6305399 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal standards
6305400 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6305401 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6305402 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6305403 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6305404 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6305405 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6305406 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6305407 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannie and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages
6305408 it is not in reaction to any specific issues as much as it is us being proactive
6305409 some people behave a little bit differently when they know their actions can be viewed again later
6305410 because of the geographic size of our school district and the necessary length of some bus routes the cameras play an even greater role in our efforts to maintain a safe climate for students
6305411 i want a corporate officer here so that it is clear what his obligations are
6305412 he shall appear here next week aug 27 at 10 oclock
6305413 there was a miscommunication today between lawsons counsel and the u s attorneys office that has been addressed and mr neri will be in attendance as requested at the next hearing
6305414 no one could go in and buy it outright like pacific summit had
6305415 in the water for at least a period of several days
6305416 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so
6305417 just because you have a bilingual program doesnt mean youre off the hook that program still has to provide equal educational opportunities and remove impediments to language barriers
6305418 its not just enough to throw money at it and say ok weve done our part
6305419 you have a lot of educators these days under a lot of stress
6305420 with a more punitive approach to punishing failing schools theres a lot a lot more animosity among the community
6305421 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6305422 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6305423 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe
6305424 they have had all these cuts they are so understaffed that if they were to do anything its only spot checks and only minimal things theyre able to do instead of an agency which can provide assistance and positive support they become reduced to this watchdog group
6305425 bilingual and ell english language learners programs are locally implemented
6305426 we do go and follow up to make sure each district is in compliance but the actual implementation is a local issue
6305427 the fact that there are no latino board members on u 46 indicates that the issues latino children and their parents are facing may not have a voice
6305428 present to the school board the perspective of english language learners of limited english students with problems in regards to services
6305429 were really looking at how its working comparing ourselves with other districts seeing if students are successfully transitioning into english classes
6305430 well certainly be interested in seeing what the u 46 lawsuits outcome is
6305431 in iraq as a muslim theres a real stigma for blindness and he would be shunned be the lowest of the social status
6305432 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6305433 leave now buy it on amazon and just get out
6305434 no im not happy books make me happy im not leaving here empty handed

6305436 do you want a sticker to put your name in them
6305437 on this day we are encouraged to recognize and show appreciation for the value and contribution of elderly people to home family and society
6305438 the judge allowed him to enter a drug diversion program
6305439 if he completes counseling and stays clean for 18 months the case will be dismissed
6305440 mr robinson really appreciates and takes seriously the opportunity which has been given to him by the court and the prosecution to have all of the charges against him dismissed upon successful completion of a counseling program

6305445 the decision to move our sole base of manufacturing operations from cranston to denham springs was based on what we found to be a more competitive business climate in louisiana
6305446 we are enthusiastic about the direction in which louisiana is heading and we want to be a part of it
6305447 this recognition is a strong indication that the capital region is doing things right in business development
6305448 were going to hire four people here and two people in houston over the next 30 days
6305449 oh damn thats right ruby doesnt support tail call optimization
6305450 in the past after sundown youre not really allowed in the park wandering around so this is going to be a special experience for everyone in attendance
6305451 when you have an artist like radiohead or tom petty or jack johnson their stage production is a large part of the show and that includes the lighting and any video so thats going to be at the core but around the festival site well be doing a lot of different things that will involve lighting and its simple as lighting the trees to sculptures that are lit up around the site
6305452 im particularly fond of northern california because thats a place where i first went to when i went to america so i liked it very much
6305453 northern california has its own particular take on music and i feel thats the kind of take that i rather agree with obviously back in the 60s it was very radical i always imagined that northern california has much more organic bohemian view towards music i mean we have to think in the first place it was the birth of jam bands with the grateful dead but it also has various other influences you know ive always tried to combine these areas of folk rock and ethnic music and jazz and it seems in a strange kind of way that san francisco has almost embodied all those elements of music
6305454 i think the decline of the record industry in many ways is quite good for the health of music because i think it gives people other routes and other avenues to get their music across such as festivals and live music i think that there is something exciting about seeing bands live
6305455 were really pushing alternative means of transportation so weve added a number of buses on lincoln and fulton as well as trains on the n judah line to encourage people to take public transportation
6305456 well also have a bike valet service which will hold up to 3 000 bicycles
6305457 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6305458 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6305459 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6305460 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6305461 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6305462 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6305463 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6305464 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6305465 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6305466 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6305467 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6305468 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
6305469 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6305470 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6305471 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6305472 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6305473 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6305474 jawad went from the freezer to the frying pan thanks to general hartmann

6305517 we havent had hot water for six months when it was cold they gave steam only a couple of hours the bathroom ceiling has been leaking for two years the refrigerator is in bad shape the building is infested with roaches and other vermin
6305518 the apartment is unhealthy and my little one has had an infection for weeks now and the owner wants to raise the rent
6305519 the problem is that you are a bunch of filthy mexicans who break things on purpose
6305520 there are a lot of people anxious to rent these apartments so if you are not happy move out
6305521 she realized that we were organizing ourselves and that we knew she could not raise the rents the way she did
6305522 and on aug 4 she sent out another letter saying that there had been a mistake and the rent hikes were canceled

6305527 the time i spent barricaded in a bedroom that morning before the police arrived was the longest scariest time of my life
6305528 many people have said at least nothing was taken but thats definitely not true i would have rather given up all my possessions in order to have my sense of security back
6305529 i came home from the gym to find vincent york gathering my things using a pair of my socks to cover his hands and using my own pillowcase from my bed to carry the items he wanted
6305530 he even helped himself to a bottle of water from the refrigerator which he left wide open
6305531 our staff is amazing so we dont necessarily need someone in parks and recreation
6305532 we have that we have the experts in that we need someone who is going to help and lead and deal with the seven person board and elected officials and get out there and do his thing
6305533 you either have it or you dont and id like to think i have the skills i think would be positive for the park board
6305534 working in naperville over 20 years i know the city certainly know people by first name and could hit the ground running and could step up and get things done and mend fences perceived to be broken
6305535 we have to become creative and tighten our belt here but we also have to meet the demands of our customers
6305536 am i a messiah absolutely not is there a lot of work ahead of me yes but i like my odds based on past successes ive had and looking at whats in place currently
6305537 as a leader or a manager of an organization if you are not creating future leaders creating people and molding people to take your position you arent a leader
6305538 id like to think if i leave here the decision will be easy for the village board to pluck someone else from within and put them in this chair
6305539 its an unusual career twist but ive had three or four different careers in my life so if it makes sense to him and to the park district then go for it
6305540 hes a good police chief and i would hate to see him go but wish him well
6305541 for the first time ever we will genuinely see these celebrities eat sleep and shower in the most disgusting prisons in the world

6305547 im supposed to feel relieved and i do a little bit
6305548 but im still troubled that this ever happened we deserve the right to express an opinion without being dragged into the legal system having been led away from my home in handcuffs after doing nothing wrong still burns a bit
6305549 thats why we went forward with the complaint i respect every persons first amendment right i dont think we should ever take any steps to curtail that this had only to do with traffic safety on a highway
6305550 you cant yell fire in a crowd and you cant hang a very large display over a highway like that its just unsafe
6305551 i took this case because i felt what happened to them was wrong

6305558 i wish to be there for my daughter while she still is a child to help her and guide her so she doesnt make the same bad decisions i have made
6305559 i myself come from a family of alcoholics and addicts and i dont want her to fall victim to this horrible disease but to break the cycle so she doesnt have to have the life that i have lived
6305560 i just blew my mind i blew the worlds mind

6305640 am i speaking to tushar same tushar who writes on india pr blog
6305641 many people believe so you are not the only one anyways go ahead what was so urgent
6305642 well i know i can dance i am a good dancer i told my employer before i joined them that i can really dance well and they were pretty impressed with the fact that i can dance they felt that dancing is critical to the job i am going to perform
6305643 listen to me completely i told them that i know dancing i can act as well and they felt it was an added advantage i further told them about things i need to learn to become a complete fit in the organization i told them about need for direction and support from the superiors and colleagues on a regular basis before i become a complete professional in the field they promised all because they felt that dancing is the critical to the job i am going to peform
6305644 i started dancing was trying to do other things as well initially they liked my dancing but later on started feeling that dancing is not everything i reminded them about the commitment they gave me about providing me proper learning experience and guidance to perform as a professional in the field they said you need to learn on the job when i started showing some new dance moves amp innovative steps they said its not required you just do what is required of you dancing can be one of the requirements but not everything
6305645 the issue is that they hired me because i can dance well and now they are saying dancing is not everything and i cant dance so i am confused what should i do should i change the employer i am learning things on my own but again i feel cheated will i be able to dance again the way i used to
6305646 its quite a common story and i am not surprised however i may have some solution for you lets see whether you can dance the way you used to after we speak

6305736 even i am not finding it easy to fully understand the new changes to the electoral system so it is important that i understand it first before i go out and inform the tikina members
6305737 oprah now ive read in your book that you said if i just replaced coffee with green tea instead that i could lose 10 pounds in six weeks dr perricone absolutely oprah now really how could that what is the big deal about this dr perricone coffee has organic acids that raise your blood sugar raise insulin insulin puts a lock on body fat when you switch over to green tea you get your caffeine youre all set but you will drop your insulin levels and body fat will fall very rapidly so 10 pounds in six weeks i will guarantee it oprah im gonna do that ok that is so good whoo that is great
6305738 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so

6305743 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6305744 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6305745 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe

6305750 present to the school board the perspective of english language learners of limited english students with problems in regards to services
6305751 were really looking at how its working comparing ourselves with other districts seeing if students are successfully transitioning into english classes
6305752 well certainly be interested in seeing what the u 46 lawsuits outcome is
6305753 that has been the normal situation in waiyevo and they have managed to control the situation there and look after the patients well
6305754 we depend on the public works department for electricity supply and the supply to the waiyevo hospital has improved compared to past years
6305755 so we were surprised to see that the hospital still experienced limited power supply because we have approved of a 24 hour supply
6305756 it is a concern that the hospital maintains the power supply has been limited so we will follow that up to verify the report
6305757 it is not in reaction to any specific issues as much as it is us being proactive
6305758 some people behave a little bit differently when they know their actions can be viewed again later
6305759 because of the geographic size of our school district and the necessary length of some bus routes the cameras play an even greater role in our efforts to maintain a safe climate for students
6305760 priority repairs have been completed except the band orchestra area
6305761 we are trying to bring the structure back to the original design or as close as possible
6305762 typically for this type of construction you are looking at a 30 40 50 year service life and often times it exceeds that
6305763 the simple answer will be 50 years but buildings can last for a long time provided that they remain functional
6305764 obviously there were some things that were not identified in those inspections
6305765 i cant come out and say that we have looked at everything
6305766 there are some things that are hidden within walls if there is no reason to believe there is a problem there are some things that arent really feasible without destroying the school we have looked at all areas of the masonry walls every stone hasnt been turned

6305849 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6305850 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6305851 we need to be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in

6305863 how sometimes we dont treat our soldiers right and that comes from all different sources of course there are some funny stories and some humorous things that have happened too
6305864 i went through a lot of things that were things that in your own job you would see people do and you werent very happy with it mine was the same way
6305865 its one of those books where you will read it and one minute you will be going i cant believe someone in the military went through all that and five minutes later you will be laughing thats just the way it is written
6305866 i am not out to criticize particular people there are no names in the book its just more about situations

6306086 all over the united states weve gotten letters and cards and they just keep coming
6306087 it takes the tears away like carol said we have bad days and we have good days
6306088 what aaron has done has affected the way they think

6306092 as usual jon porter misquoted misled and misrepresented both his record and senator titus record
6306093 jon porter is showing how desperate he is saying anything to get elected voters in the third congressional district deserve better they are looking for an independent voice in washington and that is senator dina titus
6306094 the problem with my opponent is she thinks we can tax our way out of everything
6306095 i have voted time and time again to give incentives to alternative energy companies from solar to biofuels to find additional resources
6306096 i am glad you mentioned suddenly everyone is for it drilling because as you know dina titus was against it a year ago

6306115 we worked about five months in this thing called aerosols to see if we could test gas masks and impregnated clothing to see how good they were and then one day he was transferred to working on hot agents he said norm how about working for me in the hot stuff thats how we always referred to it n was anthrax x was botulism and so forth
6306116 he was troubled after he came back from germany one time he came back and told me and he said norm i tell you right now you and i never talked about this but we were both grown ups and this was rough he said norm you would be stunned by the techniques that they used they made people talk they brainwashed people they used all kinds of drugs they used all kinds of torture
6306117 after he came back from germany the last time he sounded different when he talked to me he said i can probably tell you things that i cant tell other people because they are still in top secret material the people he saw in germany went to the extreme he said norm did you ever see a man die i said no he said well i did yes they did die some of the people they interrogated died so you can imagine the amount of work they did on these people
6306118 he said that he was going to leave he told me that he said i am getting out of that cia period
6306119 there is the possibility that it might be necessary to disclose highly classified national security information in connection with any court suit or legislative hearings
6306120 what this means for me is that a national security homicide is not only a possibility but really it is a necessity when you have a certain number of ingredients together if you are doing top secret work that is immoral arguably immoral especially in the post nuremberg period and arguably illegal and at odds with the kind of high moral position you are trying to maintain in the world then you have to have a mechanism of security which is going to include murder
6306121 every national paper and broadcasting outlet has one and usually only one reporter to whom each agency will speak

6306132 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6306133 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6306134 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6306135 we shall not adjust our bible to the age but before we have done with it by gods grace we shall adjust the age to the bible

6306139 the pitchers watch videos and i watch videos to try prepare the most i can on how to pitch hitters thats probably why the pitchers give me a lot of credit just because im doing my homework and trying to improve every day and trying for them to have a great game
6306140 lastima me equivoque contigo que pena que no fuiste inteligente

6306149 qui n puede reivindicar un derecho a recibir el cuerpo de cristo todo es un acto sin medida del amor de dios nuestro se or se hace l mismo disponible en su cuerpo y en su sangre pero no podemos decir jam s que tenemos el derecho de recibirlo en la santa comuni n cada vez que nos acercamos a l debemos hacerlo con una profunda conciencia de nuestra indignidad
6306150 recibir indignamente el cuerpo y la sangre de cristo es un sacrilegio si lo hace deliberadamente en pecado mortal es un sacrilegio
6306151 si tenemos un pecado mortal en la conciencia debemos primero confesarnos de ese pecado y recibir la absoluci n y s lo despu s acercarnos al sacramento eucar stico
6306152 funcionario p blico que con conocimiento y consentimiento sostiene acciones que est n contra la ley moral divina y eterna por ejemplo si apoya p blicamente el aborto procurado que comporta la supresi n de vidas humanas inocentes e indefensas una persona que comete pecado de esta manera debe ser amonestada p blicamente de modo que no reciba la comuni n hasta que no haya reformado la propia vida
6306153 si una persona que ha sido amonestada persiste en un pecado mortal p blico y se acerca a recibir la comuni n el ministro de la eucarist a tiene la obligaci n de neg rsela por qu sobre todo por la salvaci n de la persona misma impidi ndole realizar un sacrilegio
6306154 en primer lugar un esc ndalo referente a nuestra disposici n para recibir la santa comuni n
6306155 se debe evitar que la gente sea inducida a pensar que se puede estar en estado de pecado mortal y acercarse a la eucarist a en segundo lugar podr a existir otra forma de esc ndalo consistente en llevar a la gente a pensar que el acto p blico que esta persona est haciendo que hasta ahora todos cre an que era un pecado serio no lo es tanto si la iglesia le permite recibir la comuni n
6306156 si tenemos una figura p blica que abierta y deliberadamente sostiene los derechos abortistas y que recibe la eucarist a qu terminar pensando la gente com n puede llegar a creer que es correcto hasta cierto punto suprimir una vida inocente en el seno materno
6306157 no tiene ninguna intenci n de interferir en la vida p blica sino en el estado espiritual del pol tico o del funcionario p blico que si es cat lico debe seguir la ley divina tambi n en la esfera p blica
6306158 por tanto es simplemente rid culo y equivocado tratar de silenciar a un pastor acus ndolo de interferir en pol tica para que no pueda hacer el bien al alma de un miembro de su grey
6306159 en nuestra base de datos figura la persona que muri como desmovilizado del bloque centauro de las autodefensas

6306194 blessed is that man who has done with chance who never speaks of luck but believes that from the least even to the greatest all things are ordained of the lord we dare not leave out the least event the creeping of an aphid upon a rosebud is as surely arranged by the decree of providence as the march of a pestilence through a nation believe this for if the least is omitted from the supreme government so may the next be and the next until nothing is left in the divine hands there is no place for chance since god fills all things
6306195 the prerogative to give life or to take it away must remain with the most high the wit and wisdom of man are altogether powerless to bestow life upon even the tiniest insect we know of a surety doctrinally and we know it with equal certainty by experience that we can do nothing towards the quickening of men apart from the spirit of god if he does not come and give life we may preach until we have not another breath left but we shall not raise from the tomb of sin even the soul of a little child or bring a single sinner to the feet of christ
6306196 there stands the text and i believe that it is my fathers wish that all men should be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth 1 tim 2 4 but i know also that he does not will it so that he will not save any of them unless they believe in his dear son for he has told us over and over that he will not he will not save any man unless he forsakes his sins and turns to him with full purpose of heart that i also know and i know too that he has a people whom he will save whom by his eternal love he has chosen and by whom by his eternal power he will deliver i do not know how that squares with this that is another of the things i do not know if i go on telling you of all that i do not know i will guarantee yhou that the things that i do not know will be a hundred to one of the things that i do know
6306197 if you get condemnation out of the gospel you put the condemnation into it yourselves it is not the gospel but your rejection of it that will condemn you
6306198 the great destroyer of man is the will of man i do not believe that mans free will has ever saved a soul but mans free will has been the ruin of multitudes ye would not is still the solemn accusation of christ against guilty men matt 23 37 luke 13 34 did he not say at another time and ye will not come to me that ye might have life john 5 24 the human will is desperately set against god and is the great devourer and destroyer of thousands of good intentions and emotions which never come to anything permanent because the will is acting in opposition to that which is right and true
6306199 we are sure that the gospel we have preached is not after men because men do not take to it it is opposed even to this day if anything is hated bitterly it is the out and out gospel of the grace of god especially if that hateful word sovereignty is mentioned with it dare to say i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion rom 9 15 and furious critics will revile you without stint the modern religionist not only hates the doctrine of sovereign grace but he raves and rages at the mention of it he would sooner hear you blaspheme than preach election by the father atonement by the son or regeneration by the spirit if you want to see a man worked up until the satanic is clearly uppermost let some of the new divines hear you preach a free grace sermon a gospel which is after men will be welcomed by men but it needs a divine operation upon the heart and mind to make a man willing to receive into his utmost soul this distasteful gospel of the grace of god
6306200 god blessed william huntingdon the coal heaver to many souls though he preached a very strong calvinism while at the same time he was blessing some who preached a very weak arminianism but remember god blesses neither the calvinism nor the arminianism but the christ that is in the sermon

6306283 ace asked the informant not to mention the accident to anyone
6306284 ace stated in part this is a conspiracy to commit murder
6306285 didnt match the witnesses statements including those who survived the accident
6306286 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6306287 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6306288 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6306319 the one thing we havent done is we havent let him throw
6306320 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well just back him up again and i told him that
6306321 theres no real change i probably wont know anything until i throw
6306322 i think we need to give him a little bit of a renewed start because obviously its not working
6306323 its a tough situation were in the middle of a pennant race were in boston theres a lot of attention on him im actually proud of the way hes handled it i just think it reached the point where we felt like we had to do something
6306324 ive never had a streak like this so its sort of hard for me to describe what im going through
6306325 at this point its hard to think they can give me any more opportunities than they have

6306328 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6306329 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6306330 im hurting right now so were going to wait until tomorrow and see what happens
6306331 im kind of worried because ive been out for such a long period of time i was progressing good and now something like this happens youve just got to sit back and see what happens
6306332 the only way you could curtail that would be with rules that are known from the outset or voluntarily adopted by these athletes as they move forward in this sport
6306333 here its different because you have essentially the state stepping in to take punitive action and that is your typical first amendment scenario

6306393 to take on another debt with t hangars is probably not a wise thing to do right now
6306394 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so
6306395 just because you have a bilingual program doesnt mean youre off the hook that program still has to provide equal educational opportunities and remove impediments to language barriers
6306396 its not just enough to throw money at it and say ok weve done our part
6306397 you have a lot of educators these days under a lot of stress
6306398 with a more punitive approach to punishing failing schools theres a lot a lot more animosity among the community
6306399 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6306400 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6306401 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe
6306402 they have had all these cuts they are so understaffed that if they were to do anything its only spot checks and only minimal things theyre able to do instead of an agency which can provide assistance and positive support they become reduced to this watchdog group
6306403 bilingual and ell english language learners programs are locally implemented
6306404 we do go and follow up to make sure each district is in compliance but the actual implementation is a local issue
6306405 the fact that there are no latino board members on u 46 indicates that the issues latino children and their parents are facing may not have a voice
6306406 present to the school board the perspective of english language learners of limited english students with problems in regards to services
6306407 were really looking at how its working comparing ourselves with other districts seeing if students are successfully transitioning into english classes

6306409 vulgarity is a very important ingredient as long as its got vitality
6306410 is the faculty of distinguishing between the agreeable and the disagreeable its function is to arrange and display what gives agreeable impressions and suppress what gives disagreeable ones
6306411 if something doesnt have a bad quality i wont see anything good in it
6306412 it depends on whos wearing it of course but a beautiful vintage dress worn with 20 cheap gold chains could look amazing
6306413 ruins certain real values of the spirit taste itself for instance
6306414 wearing the oddest monstrosity just to annoy everybody and show she was not dependent on dictated taste
6306415 its bourgeois its polite there is something majestic and lovely about a bit of bad taste it has pageantry to it
6306416 and what is nice to create a new idea of chic
6306417 comme only gets away with bad taste because it does it in a cerebral way
6306418 flashy on the other hand is not good it means you have no style of your own

6306427 i think were killing him liverpool play on saturday at home against middlesbrough youll see a man there who will run the game
6306428 he gerrard did not play left so you have to explain that to redknapp
6306429 we played 4 3 2 1 defoe gerrard and rooney then three midfielders
6306430 in that position you have to play between the lines of the full backs and midfield
6306431 i decided before the game that rooney and gerrard they had only played one game will play this for an hour
6306432 i think we were controlling the game in the second half
6306433 at 2 1 we had a big chance to score again and if he scored we probably would have been winners of this match
6306434 england are a very strong team and they showed that with their late goal but it is not very often you draw against england we were very near to winning but it was still a good draw
6306435 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6306436 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6306437 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6306438 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6306439 it is important to do that when the business of the qualifying campaign begins and we are keen to make up for what happened last time
6306440 it was a difficult night playing against a good team early on in the season and most of us played on sunday
6306441 it was a tough game but we got a good draw against a good side but we are disappointed not to have won

6306455 we sell guns no id required no background checks criminals and

6306458 he was armed with a 45 caliber handgun which he used in the shooting as well as a 9 mm handgun which he had on his possession
6306459 he also had in his possession whats described as a 6 inch knife
6306460 it would place stricter requirements on the way in which these guns can be bought and sold making it harder for terrorists assassins and other criminals to obtain these powerful weapons this is not a matter of firearm safety but a matter of national security

6306471 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6306472 thats absurd and it basically says lets not talk about it
6306473 what this movement calls for is a national discussion it doesnt recommend a policy
6306474 students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6306475 if kids are able to handle themselves responsibly then why not
6306476 i know all over the world it is like 18 some places 16 in canada its 19 i always thought 21 was a weird number at 18 youre old enough to join the army and die but you cant drink a beer
6306477 itll keep kids out of trouble i think college kids are responsible enough to take care of themselves
6306478 they shouldnt be able to drink if theyre seniors in high school if i was allowed to drink when i was 18 i definitely would have gotten drunk every day after high school it would have been bad news
6306479 it would be much better to say youre 18 now
6306480 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science

6306498 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6306499 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6306500 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6306501 on this issue we fully support russia the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia

6306512 turkey has broken ranks with the west the west can no longer take turkey for granted as a staunch ally against tehran in the past turkey stood with the west especially after the 1979 islamist revolution in iran also tehran gave refuge to the kurdistan workers party or pkk which carried out terror attacks in turkey from bases in iran since the iraq war began however iran has shifted tactics to win turkey s heart

6306518 this is not the first time that valeri liukin has targeted australian judges and he obviously looks at the judge who has not given the result he wants for his daughter
6306519 if shed got the gold medal he wouldnt be noticing helens judging but the result is not what he likes so he then goes looking for a scapegoat
6306520 i shifted to a couple of places in the north island before finally ending my career in paekakariki in 1978
6306521 i met my wife in paekakariki and decided to stay
6306522 fathers would start their shift changing over from their sons who had just finished nightshift
6306523 with the family being on different shifts the mother would be up day and night cooking cleaning and some even had time to work in the cafeteria

6306556 weve got more quality guys at the kicker and punter positions since weve been here

6306586 we are obviously short given that three mainline strikers are out for a significant period of time with injury and another is yet to come back from the olympics
6306587 im not too sure whats going on i didnt realise alan pardew was even there the other night until somebody told me
6306588 obviously ive heard things about going on loan to charlton but havent heard anything through the club on it so at the minute im still here and working hard to get into the team
6306589 obviously i would like to stay here and play but we have a very strong squad so i would be happy to be loaned out to get a few more games in as i can then come back and force my way in
6306590 it was good to see the young boys involved even though we need new faces to come in but the club will deal with that
6306591 i have spoken to yak vaughany and lukas and i saw some highlights on evertontv
6306592 the guys did really well against blackburn and we were unlucky to concede at such a late stage in the game
6306593 that is the acas intelligence surely they cannot just watch someone committing a crime and do nothing because they know a crime has been committed they act
6306594 there is no need to inform me this is their job and i heard it from the news
6306595 i think newcastle have made two great signings in gutierrez and colcoccini
6306596 the big difference for them both and what is different to when myself and ricky villa signed for tottenham is that they have both already played in europe
6306597 there is a slight adjustment to be made from playing in argentina and then europe
6306598 but the great thing for the two boys is that they have already had a really good grounding in la liga with real mallorca and deportivo la coruna
6306599 having watched them in spain i think they are both very good players indeed
6306600 for me la liga and the premier league are the two top leagues in the world and quality players can adapt quickly which we have already witnessed
6306601 it was brilliant for ricky and i to sign for tottenham back then become favourites with the crowd and then to win something at wembley
6306602 of course there were some frustrated players but the only way for them to vent their frustrations is to train well and put their hat in the ring for the blackburn game
6306603 on saturday the decision was based on who was tiring and who might bring us pace
6306604 that doesnt mean to say that therell never be a place for dean windass to start thats for sure
6306605 my first game at the lane wasnt even a league game but the atmosphere against roma was unbelievable i hope it will be the same for sunderland
6306606 the same goes for the travelling support for the game against middlesbrough which was great for the team and very important for our confidence
6306607 i know it will be a difficult game against sunderland but we play to win at home and the fans will be behind us so we have every chance of a win
6306608 goalkeepers only stop the ball but i could tell the quality of the opposition was of a very high level and this requires a lot of concentration from the goalkeeper
6306609 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6306610 we see the big picture of demand destruction in the u s but there is also a lot of bullish news that is driving the market
6306611 hes been a lot of help to me ever since he went down
6306612 hes definitely on my back all the time its starting to get annoying hes in my ear more than secondary coach dave campo
6306613 that shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that
6306614 the day he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he has stayed on me ever since then
6306615 he has great feet good technique its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there
6306616 it shows a lot of people are believing in me he said
6306617 i learned after the game when i got schooled on that in the end zone that once the quarterback rolls out of the pocket i can pretty much steer the receiver where i want to
6306618 in college you cant touch the receiver past 5 yards
6306619 you know im pretty pissed off about the show tuesday night
6306620 we are getting there slowly i was pleased i was really pleased for mookie thats the furthest anybody from toronto has ever gotten in the competition torontos one of those cities that really wants to be new york in many ways and im a toronto boy born and raised here and im so proud of the city in so many ways so yeah i was really pleased to see someone from the city and also someone whos so bloody good get so far
6306621 almost like in a national election ontario has a huge impact on the results and its interesting because the most number of votes do come from this part of the country and yet its the least biased from a voting perspective theyll just vote for whoever is the best singer
6306622 we just sort of said they all were so good and the songs were so well chosen for them that it was one of those things where im not going to be happy if anyone goes and its not going to be wrong if anyone goes
6306623 so you know i agree with you there hasnt been that moment when everyone goes there has been a travesty in the voting mind you i think there were a lot of people that were shocked that mookie left last night you could certainly hear a gasp in the audience but coming from toronto a lot of the fans in the audience its a lot easier to get to are from toronto and are mookie fans he seems to have had more overwhelming support with our live audience in the theatre than others just because of his geography and hes got a local fan base here
6306624 one of the reasons we chose to do it was that we were really hoping that those people who live in those far away communities could have access to the program a bit of my obsession is to be all inclusive you know the u s show goes to five cities and we go to a minimum of 10 sometimes 12 or 13 cities and try to get to as many provinces as humanly possible
6306625 did we have anybody from those communities who was strong enough with the competition at hand not this year but my hope is that the idea that you still have a chance to be on the program and you come from a tiny community in the middle of the northwest territories is really appealing to me
6306626 ive seen people go from down near the bottom to first in a week i saw that happen last season with brian melo when all of the sudden he came out and sang
6306627 so i might have thought gee i dont know if drew can make it the distance but i thought he really just laid himself out there with

6306655 nothing is more damaging to the environment than the waste we generate we must find new solutions to old methods of managing waste that are not effective
6306656 all of us must think and head towards the same direction with the new development activities we must find solutions accordingly
6306657 if the current practices of municipal solid waste management system such as open dumping and burning goes on not only will the life of the existing landfills be reduced but itll have a big environmental impact

6306659 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing which is the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in the country
6306660 despite the brutal murder the archdiocese will not close the parish that fr pandippaly was in charge of because such incidents can not scare the church

6306667 we want to promote our incentives like tax concession to attract foreign investors
6306668 our aim is to employ bhutanese so incentives are focused around that
6306669 were looking at the incentives whether to increase them and if so by how much to attract good foreign investors
6306670 after it was removed we felt a lot of pain
6306671 the bridge was our sacred jewel and after it was removed we felt a lot of pain
6306672 because of this i feel these days people are suffering more from illness and natural calamaties like untimely rainfall and landslides
6306673 earlier tourists as well as people from across the country used to come and pay their respects to the bridge and when they returned they bought hand woven kiras ghos and other products but these days such good fortunes are a rarity
6306674 although duksum bridge does not have great significance in the tourisim sector the chains of cha zam are their property and should not have been taken to another place
6306675 ek was die laaste ruk heel verwyderd van die blogw reld en het weer begin blog nadat bierpens voorgestel het dat ek steeds voortgaan met blog vir verskeie redes wat ek nie nou hier gaan noem nie my hele blogstyl het verander in die sin dat ek nie meer baie inskrywings self doen nie maar ek laai verskeie ander skrywers met wie ek saamstem se boodskappe noodwendig het ek weer begin om so hier en daar n blog te lees as ek n kansie kry ek was verstom om te sien hoe die blogoorlog uitgebrei het tussen bloggers ek sien dit onder die afrikaanse blogs en ook onder engelse blogs en dan wonder ek wat is die oorsaak daarvan
6306676 ek noem julle nie meer diensknegte nie omdat die dienskneg nie weet wat sy heer doen nie maar ek het julle vriende genoem omdat ek alles wat ek van my vader gehoor het aan julle bekend gemaak het
6306677 julle is my vriende as julle alles doen wat ek julle beveel
6306678 this result is not a disappointment its more of a reality check
6306679 i think theres some promise to hescs but you dont want to be foolish and say these cells are going to cure things in the next five years
6306680 we dont know if thats long enough for them to mature and have an effect
6306681 our only finding here is that this combo of drugs can have a medicating effect on these cells

6306687 publishers gave their agreement they would do this we are very disappointed not doing it goes against the spirit of the agreement
6306688 we feel let down we hope publishers will want to work with advertisers with a greater degree of cooperation trust and transparency in future
6306689 we agreed with several other publishers at a ppa abc meeting to put the monthly circulation figures we submitted to abc on our website within 30 days of the concurrent release
6306690 i am really disappointed so much effort has gone into getting to this point it was a compromise made by agencies and clients we wanted a monthly release of data
6306691 the compromise was to get six months data as normal but retrospectively breaking down the performance for each month of that period
6306692 most of the major consumer magazine publishing companies will be producing monthly circulation figures on their websites and some have already posted theirs
6306693 other publishers have released through the voluntary opt in on the abc certificate
6306694 the ppa boards position is that it would advise publishers to release monthly figures soon after the concurrent release
6306695 agencies should be very encouraged by the large amount of new data that will now be available in the marketplace
6306696 who the h3ll would use it anyway you would have to be crazy
6306697 however most youth are innocent and dont realise that their behaviour is coming in conflict with the law
6306698 if their behaviour comes in conflict with the law we need to explain it to them
6306699 that is not an answer whats more important is that we should go for crime prevention
6306700 the programme will also help youth become friendly with the police understand us and become responsible citizens

6306743 the second half was diabolical they didnt look like the same players who perform week in week out in the premier league what are we doing to them
6306744 we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder
6306745 it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre we are killing gerrard
6306746 i came to wembley full of optimism we keep chopping and changing managers and we dont improve

6306749 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6306750 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6306751 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6306752 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6306753 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6306762 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6306763 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6306764 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6306765 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6306766 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6306767 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6306768 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6306769 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6306770 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6306771 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6306772 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6306781 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6306782 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6306783 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6306798 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6306799 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6306800 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6306801 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6306827 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6306828 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6306829 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6306830 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6306831 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

6306852 if it starts causing more technical problems rather than being used for the business selling the truck should be considered
6306853 the truck should be sold away if it is giving some minor problems but is fetching you a good resale value

6306859 this past spring tp was notified that our domestic violence funding would be cut by more than 28 percent also without a budget signed by the governor no funding can be released at all so not only do we have this permanent loss of funds but currently we are not even getting the funds that were allocated to turning point
6306860 this is our largest annual fundraiser and while times are hard all over i know that mchenry county will come through for us again
6306861 these funding cuts specifically target our childrens programs we are determined to close this budget gap and not allow our programs to be eliminated

6306881 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6306886 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6306887 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6306888 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6306889 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6306890 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6306891 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6306892 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6306893 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6306894 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6306895 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6306896 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6306897 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6306898 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6306899 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6306900 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6306901 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6306902 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6306903 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6306904 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6306905 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6306906 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6306907 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6306908 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6306909 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6306910 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6306911 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6306912 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6306913 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6306914 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6306915 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6306916 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6306917 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6306918 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6306919 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6306920 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6306921 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6306922 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6306923 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6306924 situasi ini berbeda dengan musim lalu tapi kami juga tertinggal di awal musim beruntung permainan kami bisa stabil hingga akhir musim syarat juara adalah terus menjaga permainan dan kemenangan
6306925 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6306926 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6306927 the time i spent barricaded in a bedroom that morning before the police arrived was the longest scariest time of my life
6306928 many people have said at least nothing was taken but thats definitely not true i would have rather given up all my possessions in order to have my sense of security back
6306929 i came home from the gym to find vincent york gathering my things using a pair of my socks to cover his hands and using my own pillowcase from my bed to carry the items he wanted
6306930 he even helped himself to a bottle of water from the refrigerator which he left wide open

6306935 she roy is a loose cannon who has abused liberal traditions of india to its fullest
6306936 it is a great tribute to the tolerance of indias ethos that a person who openly calls for balkanization of country is not being locked up and the keys are not being thrown away
6306937 we like to think of ourselves as on the cutting edge of safety
6306938 the initial response should be going after the shooter and bypassing anybody whos injured because we have to stop further harm
6306939 it was nice to see the second team thought more tactically
6306940 it may not be correct to train that way when its not realistic
6306941 we need to make sure theyre capable of being flexible
6306942 you can get a situation under control quicker when you understand what each others capabilities are
6306943 that is when martha cut me from behind with a knife
6306944 she cut my neck and stabbed me in the shoulder and in my stomach i yelled for help and people started coming out i escaped and started running toward the buildings
6306945 i tried to help martha and in return i have suffered greatly
6306946 i wish to be there for my daughter while she still is a child to help her and guide her so she doesnt make the same bad decisions i have made
6306947 i myself come from a family of alcoholics and addicts and i dont want her to fall victim to this horrible disease but to break the cycle so she doesnt have to have the life that i have lived
6306948 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6306949 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6306950 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean

6306953 priority repairs have been completed except the band orchestra area
6306954 we are trying to bring the structure back to the original design or as close as possible
6306955 typically for this type of construction you are looking at a 30 40 50 year service life and often times it exceeds that
6306956 the simple answer will be 50 years but buildings can last for a long time provided that they remain functional
6306957 obviously there were some things that were not identified in those inspections
6306958 i cant come out and say that we have looked at everything
6306959 there are some things that are hidden within walls if there is no reason to believe there is a problem there are some things that arent really feasible without destroying the school we have looked at all areas of the masonry walls every stone hasnt been turned
6306960 the district is funding this we hope to recapture these funds through litigation
6306961 the department has made a concerted effort the past few years to open thomson
6306962 the best available option for the department at this time is to close pontiac
6306963 many of the spouses of those employees are our nurses doctors teachers and so on
6306964 blagojevich refused to move his family to springfield because he didnt want to interrupt his daughters lifestyle im thinking ive got five kids and they dont want to interrupt their lifestyles
6306965 we cant believe a word that comes out of your mouth
6306966 lets face it the governor changed his mind a few days after the recall vote
6306967 certainly closing the prison is not something he wants to do
6306968 at the same time though the funding needs to be available

6306993 acesta corespunde perfect la ceea ce s a nt mplat n kosovo la ceea ce s a nt mplat n osetia de sud
6306994 v este cunoscut faptul c rom nia este una dintre rile care nu au recunoscut kosovo consider nd c decizia de a crea un stat pe teritoriul unui stat suveran i independent contravine legilor dreptului interna ional contravine principiului integrit ii teritoriale i a inviolabilit ii frontierelor statelor

6307006 im supposed to feel relieved and i do a little bit
6307007 but im still troubled that this ever happened we deserve the right to express an opinion without being dragged into the legal system having been led away from my home in handcuffs after doing nothing wrong still burns a bit
6307008 thats why we went forward with the complaint i respect every persons first amendment right i dont think we should ever take any steps to curtail that this had only to do with traffic safety on a highway
6307009 you cant yell fire in a crowd and you cant hang a very large display over a highway like that its just unsafe

6307020 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6307021 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6307022 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phony here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me

6307025 the event is clearly linked to yesterdays terrorist attack in london
6307026 this u 46 case has the potential to influence school districts and rightly so
6307027 just because you have a bilingual program doesnt mean youre off the hook that program still has to provide equal educational opportunities and remove impediments to language barriers
6307028 its not just enough to throw money at it and say ok weve done our part
6307029 you have a lot of educators these days under a lot of stress
6307030 with a more punitive approach to punishing failing schools theres a lot a lot more animosity among the community
6307031 every district has some leeway as to how they implement their bilingual programs
6307032 what the law requires you are supposed to have a research based curriculum and plan to address your needs you are supposed to have entrance and exit criteria youre supposed to monitor those youre supposed to have that skeleton
6307033 there are very few people around to even talk to at isbe
6307034 they have had all these cuts they are so understaffed that if they were to do anything its only spot checks and only minimal things theyre able to do instead of an agency which can provide assistance and positive support they become reduced to this watchdog group
6307035 bilingual and ell english language learners programs are locally implemented
6307036 we do go and follow up to make sure each district is in compliance but the actual implementation is a local issue
6307037 the fact that there are no latino board members on u 46 indicates that the issues latino children and their parents are facing may not have a voice
6307038 present to the school board the perspective of english language learners of limited english students with problems in regards to services
6307039 were really looking at how its working comparing ourselves with other districts seeing if students are successfully transitioning into english classes
6307040 well certainly be interested in seeing what the u 46 lawsuits outcome is
6307041 we believe more information can only help consumers make informed decisions and help us to make changes

6307063 as the states financial contributions to higher education are lessened the need for private support grows increasingly strong
6307064 it is not in reaction to any specific issues as much as it is us being proactive
6307065 some people behave a little bit differently when they know their actions can be viewed again later
6307066 because of the geographic size of our school district and the necessary length of some bus routes the cameras play an even greater role in our efforts to maintain a safe climate for students
6307067 we do have a medal from boxing but with a little bit of luck we could have had three
6307068 i knew there was no point in taking chances and we had a strategy for the bout now we will plan our semi final also akhil and my coaches will help me and we will work together just as we have all this time
6307069 i gave it all but it was not to be i am still proud of the way we fought
6307070 he will come back only with the gold vijender was determined to win before the match and he and i think he will come back with a gold medal
6307071 we are confident of his win my is brother is not one to give up his quest for the gold
6307072 using language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player umpire referee team official or spectator
6307073 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6307074 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6307075 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6307076 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6307077 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6307078 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6307079 we are currently undertaking the biggest reform of our immigration system for 40 years
6307080 over the next eighteen months we will introduce our australian style points based system for workers roll out our e borders programme to count people in and out of the country and require id cards for foreign nationals
6307081 since the introduction of the initial immigration act in 1971 the world has changed dramatically now more than ever our laws must be clear people must speak our language obey our rules and pay their taxes

6307091 the client or ad agency will have difficulty figuring a budget for that widget because they can blow through that in a short period of time or if the widget doesnt succeed they could be left with unused money at the end of the campaign that they could have spent simultaneously on other media
6307092 not knowing how much to budget would have delayed our response or engagement with getting widgets out there
6307093 youve been in my life so long i cant remember anything else
6307094 im not going to say all of the jobs in martinsville are going to come back if im elected president
6307095 what im saying is that im going to wake up every morning thinking about you
6307096 we needed to win before we went to premadasa for the remainder of the series there was lot of pressure on us but zaheer did the job for us we would have loved to win comfortably but nevertheless we would take this
6307097 we didnt want to put pressure on anyone and even called off the team meeting you can discuss 1 000 things and that itself can put pressure on you we just allowed everyone to mentally prepare for the game
6307098 promoting myself up the order worked but credit should go to badri subramaniam badrinath he batted well on debut he hadnt played muralitharan and mendis before and its good to see him doing so well
6307099 its good to have a break ahead of the next game if we had lost here we would have been really down
6307100 you need to be consistent my responsibility is to provide early breakthroughs i just bowled within myself it was important to keep in the right areas and i thought all the bowlers did well to restrict sri lanka
6307101 this is a wicket that we are not used to its very fresh wicket that makes batting a bit difficult but its a good wicket and has a good bounce you need to survive against the new ball
6307102 we will do everything to encourage these sportsmen and to encourage disciplines like boxing in the state we will open a boxing academy in bhiwani to encourage more youngsters to take to this sport
6307103 i owe my career to satpal singhji who is my guru and taught me all i know i dedicate this medal to him
6307104 this is my greatest moment i know lot of people may not have thought we wrestling team could win a medal but we did think we could
6307105 all sportspersons dream of an olympic medal i was upset after losing the first round which i could have won
6307106 there is not much time to think the coaches were talking to me and i was myself trying to relax and get ready for the next fight
6307107 i thought i could have won the bout in the morning but still luck was with me as the ukraine wrestler reached the final and i got into the repachage it was still not easy and fighting three bouts in just over one hour is very tiring and tough
6307108 it was not easy out there i had to compete in four bouts today which did make me weary towards the end i had not played against doug schwab usa and albert batyrov belarus earlier so they were unknown rivals for me but once i got past them and had leonid spiridonov kazakhstan against me i sensed my chance i said to myself i cannot let it go after coming so close to a medal and if i was tired so was he
6307109 we have all been preparing for the games and over the years wrestling has been a sport which has come close to medals even at olympics
6307110 i think these are sensible and proportional ways of toughening up what is already a very tough system i think thats what we owe to children in this country and to children abroad
6307111 i am extremely delighted and proud that you have won the bronze medal
6307112 your determination grit and ambition for achievement have given the nation its second medal at the games you have proved that hard work will always bring laurels
6307113 of course thats why we all compete others may not have expected a medal from us but we the coaches and wrestlers did

6307186 no por falta de iniciativa que lo permitiera porque el pp mantuvo la suya sino por el absurdo empecinamiento de otros grupos de no apoyar la propuesta popular
6307187 han vuelto a desnaturalizar el sistema parlamentario y a comportarse como comodines del ejecutivo a pesar de que ciu y erc estaban de acuerdo con la presencia de zapatero en el congreso

6307269 i would move forward on legislation to end sanctuary city policies if abbott says such a move would be legal
6307270 the only thing i can say is pete wilson is the best thing that happened to the california democratic party go for it baby
6307271 the more mean spirited they get the more mainstream texans realize that those types of policies arent in the best interest of our state and they certainly arent in the best interest of our families
6307272 which would hinder state enforcement of the federal immigration laws
6307273 primarily because we believe this is a federal issue that needs a federal solution
6307274 in order to avoid sanctions theyre letting go of their work force before anything can happen
6307275 its creating a culture of fear in the entire community its bad for everybody its bad for the workers and their families its bad for the businesses owners its bad for the community for people who depend on the services of these businesses
6307276 if this were to pass in texas we might see an increase in migration away from texas which might be what they want but it would be very difficult for communities here and cause a lot of strain on families

6307283 and you have a situation that the rest of the world views with shock and incomprehension
6307284 its a pretty traditional criminal law that accomplices and co conspirators are equally held culpable
6307285 you dont have to specifically agree to commit a killing you agree to commit the target crime then any other crimes that are foreseeable youre responsible

6307370 the world trade center attacks mark a deep cut in our recent history that is still being processed

6307385 its extremely difficult to keep people away from the cliff especially with the lack of beach that we have and the tide being so high so people have a tendency to be on the beach under the cliff theres not a lot we can do

6307410 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6307411 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6307412 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6307413 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6307414 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6307415 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests

6307511 als bedrijfseconoom met een financi le achtergrond ben ik goed onderlegd maar ik heb de grootste moeite om de cijfers van mijn concurrenten te doorgronden het is voor de toezichthouder verdomd moeilijk te controleren je ziet dat daar de touwtjes aangehaald worden voor centrale banken is het nog complexer
6307512 als verzekeraars hun gegevens transparanter maken heeft dat meer dan onze warme belangstelling
6307513 in die markt weten we dat als er geen of weinig handel is de waarde van producten niet te bepalen is in de verzekeringsmarkt lijken alle hedgingstrategie n in theorie te kloppen maar in alle gesecuriseerde producten zoals series risicovolle hypotheken van subprime tot de alt a papieren en de creditcardmarkt wordt bijna niet gehandeld de waarde is niet te bepalen toch doen verzekeraars dat
6307514 het duurt anderhalf jaar voordat we zicht hebben op de winnaars en de verliezers
6307515 hypotheken zijn een ankerproduct je verkoopt er vaak andere producten omheen
6307516 in de slechte marktsituatie komen andere partijen op de markt we hebben voldoende cash om andere partijen te kopen als de crisis doorzet ben ik daar juist optimistisch over
6307517 verzekeraars zijn een gewone industrie die ieder jaar meer volume moet maken en minder kosten komende tien jaar moeten die kosten elk jaar 5 omlaag
6307518 grote en middelgrote bedrijven willen af van de risicos van pensioenen op hun balans die zorgen voor enorme volatiliteit in de resultaten hun financi le resultaten worden door verplichte waardering volgens de ifrs standaard disproportioneel be nvloed
6307519 de pensioenomzet groeit zo hard we profiteren van de eis dat je alles op je balans naar marktwaarde waardeert zover zijn veel concurrenten niet
6307520 ik heb de enorme dip van 2001 2002 zeer bewust meegemaakt collegas zaten toen dicht tegen hun solvabiliteitsgrens dat is nu verbeterd als deze crisis doorzet komt ook onze winstgevendheid onder druk maar verder is het concern kerngezond verzekeraars komen door dit dalletje jazeker dalletje het is geen bungee jumping
6307521 yes im sorry about that i was trying to feed the humans first

6307982 but the long term sustainability of a reloading strategy is a question
6307983 theres a large volume of natural gas production coming on line throughout the country
6307984 our role is to make accessible resources needed for the countrys energy security
6307985 companies continue to display an increasingly larger appetite for deep water blocks as we have seen over the last few years of lease sales
6307986 you cant assume that every lease that everybody has is going to produce oil
6307987 it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the website if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense at the request of the board of directors jonathan crutchley has stepped down as chairman all my life i have never voted to the right and have always been generous to 20th century democrats gay and lesbian advocates and defenders the human rights commission and the national gay and lesbian task force i was arrested at the supreme court and fda in act up actions and was the founder of the grass roots gay rights fund which over the years has raised more than 800 000 i began giving obama donations in march 2007 and i have sent several checks that have yet to be reported the hat and t shirt i wear say obama for president as does the sign in front of my house i refuse to live in a country that is so marred by war and hate to me barack is by far the best candidate probably better than we deserve

6307995 die anarchistischen zeiten sind ja jetzt zu ende ich meine die zeit des freiern verkehrs im internet die die jetzt abgemahnt werden sind die aids toten des informationszeitalters ich war bislang im glauben dass die technologie am l ngeren hebel sitzt aber jetzt f rchte ich doch ernstlich dass die software riesen denen der staat zuarbeitet das oberwasser gewinnen wird und das geht jetzt aber nur mit ziemlicher brutalit t seitens des staats darum ist mein st ck so kurz das ist zu ende als n chstes komme ich mit einem leeren laster und reiche ein symbolisches nichts ein meine musik ist nun gel utert und rein nur von mir und niemandem sonst

6307997 rosja pope ni a b d stosuj c nieadekwatne rodki w gruzji
6307998 the way this came down is my agent said in may youve got to read this
6307999 i read a couple of pages and discovered it was a vampire detective and i said not only am i not going to read this im going to sue them this is my show but he kept talking to me and eventually i did read and i did fall in love with it its vampire 2007 its a new ball game its certainly a genre show but just some tiny examples there are no other demons there are no other monsters its not that supernatural of a world its a sleek modern world los angeles literally the vampire makeup is different the mythology is different and its a world where they really live among us theres not that many of them and the show has all my favorite things its got deep heart and big love and funny which im attracted to
6308000 the other shows i did went way into the past and youd find yourself in time immemorial and ancient curses and things there was a good deal of brooding this is more of an ironic take on what it means to be immortal which its sort of hinted that the only thing worse than being mortal might be to be immortal particularly if an immortal loved a mortal the whole look and feel of the show is different
6308001 there is a really neat wry voiceover from mick st john played wonderfully by alex oloughlin we are being pushed to a level of maniacal excellence be young mr joel silver who cares deeply about everything including every line the early work had humor as well but the show has kind of its own different sense of humor for example jason dohring is playing a 400 year old vampire going on 30 a guy who embraces life loves hedonism loves drinking blood just loves everything about life and is a multi gazillionaire because hes a hedge fund trader so there is a certain kind of energy to the show you wont see people with funny masks
6308002 prior to buffy and angel ive never done any genre stuff therefore i didnt know the secret of the genre which is you can exaggerate the emotions and you can hit people over the head with a big wallop one of the things i love about this show and really wanting to do it on cbs is a big emotional wallop on each show there will be fun there will be scare and then something that you just go oh my gosh i didnt see that coming whether its star crossed lovers or lost love found love im a big believer in the genre what i would say used correctly used to exaggerate the emotions because people can surrender to genre and then in one part saying thats not quite 100 percent true and somehow it opens a door for them to let more stuff into their heart and then i really like when people are in very dangerous life threatening situations that they are quipping because im amused by things like that
6308003 hes a consummate host of major live broadcast events and a proven talent who always makes it look easy which makes him the perfect choice for this years emmys telecast
6308004 there has been a very serious difference of opinion between brian barwick the fa chief executive and lord triesman the new fa chairman
6308005 they disagreed over the role of the chief executive and the restructuring of the
6308006 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6308007 lo que no te mata te hace m s fuerte
6308008 more businesses are restricting access to these kinds of sites employees may not like it but these web sites can represent a security risk if used carelessly unless theres a work purpose many firms do not see any reason why staff should need to access them during work time
6308009 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access web sites like facebook and myspace during office hours

6308015 its going to take the unlocking of drm digital rights management first of all to unseat itunes
6308016 that would uncouple itunes from the ipod and then there has to be a device as successful as the ipod waiting i dont see one yet
6308017 but this deal should get them a little more market share
6308018 but not because glaser said so drm just gets in peoples way and it has no benefit to the labels theyre beginning to understand that
6308019 its good for all of them but what it really means is that its more likely they can compete against apple
6308020 angelina jolie pregnancy was not a hoax john mccain is not going to vietnam as part of his presidential campaign
6308021 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6308022 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right

6308030 this it pilot fish heads a group responsible for backing up a large pool of servers with a huge amount
6308031 special teams is a very important phase of the game but i want to play defense
6308032 i want to play as many downs as i can on sundays d tackle d end wherever it may be thats my goal being given an opportunity to make more of an impact on defense is big thats what im trying to do
6308033 but wed also like to get him some plays at defensive end we feel like he can do that too he wont do a lot of the special teams this year which will be a little different from what he did last year
6308034 inside i think i can bring some quickness to that three technique or that nose position and just use some of my length and ability
6308035 im a lot taller than the average tackle and a lot of guards are short armed guys so i just use some quickness continue to work on my technique and using my arms
6308036 aakashagopuram is an adaptation of the henrik ibsen classic master builder the entire film was shot in england
6308037 it lifts the play from the level of the mundane
6308038 adapting master builder is the greatest tribute i can pay to the playwright whose dramas have always inspired me
6308039 in this world where too many are willing to see only the light that is visible never the light invisible we have a daily darkness that is night and we encounter another darkness from time to time that is death the deaths of those we love but the third and most constant darkness that is with us every day at all hours of every day is the darkness of the mind the pettiness and meanness and hatred which we have invited into ourselves and which we pay out with generous interest
6308040 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6308041 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6308042 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6308043 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6308044 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all
6308045 this is my third pair of contact lenses in my left eye third one of the week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of it
6308046 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6308047 its a very long golf course its definitely going to be a week
6308048 driving it in the fairway is a premium but the driver is the strength of my game when im on with my driver i dont miss many fairways
6308049 i like westchester i think its a great golf course
6308050 i do feel as though ridgewood is a step up in quality its just a wonderful golf course ive always loved going to westchester but this course really has a major championship feel its a tillinghast same designer as winged foot same designer i believe as baltusrol very similar feel and it has that northeast major championship feel
6308051 the 18th hole doglegs right not left so thats a nice change
6308052 the rough is up and spotty in some spots where its real gnarly and laying all over the place
6308053 its going to be difficult if you hit it in the rough and the greens provide a challenge too because they are pretty severe in some spots and difficult
6308054 i feel i wouldnt have some of the tracks on my album if it wasnt for 50 and he wouldnt have some of the things he had if he wasnt up against me in the last couple of years people have been putting out albums aimlessly nas used to talk about biggie and jay and wu tang going up against each other but now its like there hasnt been that competition in rap in new york wests cant tell me nothing is the 2 song on the radio and 50s i get money is the 1 song theyre neck and neck so its exciting to people
6308055 please 50 dont retire once my album sells and beats your album
6308056 i told jay i did a song with coldplay next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
6308057 in the back of my mind im like oh wait translate espa ol no way jos i should have talked to you like a man i should have told you first but i went and told somebody else and thats what made sh worse my big brother was b i g s brother used to be dame and biggs brother
6308058 it looked as if a giant foot had stepped on the buildings
6308059 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6308060 some of them were in middle school when i was a high school senior
6308061 i cant believe how many young guys weve got running around here but we need them because we dont have a lot of returning experience
6308062 we mentioned earlier that we have to have some of the young receivers come on
6308063 im really pleased with malcolm williams hes having a heck of a camp it goes without saying that quan and jordan are doing well but malcolm is doing really well dan buckner has had a very productive camp and james kirkendoll has done the same
6308064 you never know how theyre going to play when they get out in front of 98 000 people
6308065 we have our scrimmages in the stadium and everything and i catch them looking around and just wondering
6308066 we make our comments and get them ready for it i think theyre going to do fine theyre playmakers and theyre ready
6308067 we really dont know we havent played a game yet
6308068 we have a lot of guys that are making plays for us showing up and getting better the coaches will decide who plays and when they do im confident in whoever they pick
6308069 i think people are worried im going to undermine the franchise by being outwardly comic
6308070 but i hope i can put their minds at rest and tell them im approaching it with complete and utter dedication to the original
6308071 i couldnt get a feel for the greens i wish it was a scorecard playoff at the sectional
6308072 they definitely want to think theyre one of the better teams in the state
6308073 lets put it another way in the area i expected us to be good we have five guys back from a conference championship team
6308074 i birdied the first hole and that really relaxed me
6308075 my warm ups were really bad and i just tried to stay relaxed
6308076 when i told them we won they were like what tournament
6308077 its hard to adjust to a course that is this tough
6308078 teach this threefold truth to all a generous heart kind speech and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity
6308079 minblowingly inappropriate for its depiction of teen drug and alcohol use and is every parents worst nightmare
6308080 it is a really balance car and it could speed up
6308081 i would move forward on legislation to end sanctuary city policies
6308082 if we get a green light my focus will be on those employers who are paying illegals under the table with cash and not paying any taxes and creating an unfair business environment for other businesses
6308083 the only thing i can say is pete wilson is the best thing that happened to the california democratic party go for it baby
6308084 the more mean spirited they get the more mainstream texans realize that those types of policies arent in the best interest of our state and they certainly arent in the best interest of our families
6308085 which would hinder state enforcement of the federal immigration laws
6308086 primarily because we believe this is a federal issue that needs a federal solution
6308087 we do get a lot of constituencies concerned about illegal immigration in regards that its impacting our communities from a tax dollar standpoint and our education systems our health care systems
6308088 we have now become another chapter in the mirasol tale but probably not the final chapter
6308089 it seems now that the time is right for the saha board to take over to bring closure to the construction matters
6308090 we did what we were supposed to do now is the time for the changeover
6308091 the legal issues allowed us to take one step forward and two steps back
6308092 were committed to providing leadership and fixing the houses as best we can
6308093 were committed to completing the buyback plan and well continue to be accountable to the community
6308094 we believe the completion of restatements by verifone reduces the risk of investing in the shares
6308095 for people to begin to take a proactive approach to their health they really need to know what their percentage of fat versus muscle is
6308096 most studies have shown that by just adding one circumference measurement at the waist to bmi you can better predict a patients risk for type 2 diabetes and for all cause mortality waist circumference is also about twice as good at predicting future coronary heart disease than bmi alone

6308107 jonathan do you want to come and watch a movie with me
6308108 because across the universe is a chick flick worse its a chick flick that is about hippies and you know how i feel about hippies
6308109 i still have no idea how you have this hatred of hippies yet loved living in eugene oregon i will also remind you that when you came back from living in the land of the hippies you had bleached hair down to your shoulder blades with a long red beard your mother and i do talk from time to time well leave that for another day though what i want to know is what possible objection could you have about the story of russia afghanistan and the wheels being set in motion to end the cold war that seems totally up your ally
6308110 because it is hollywood and hollywood will put a completely liberal spin on it somehow they usually do besides i rarely look at them for an accurate historical reproduction of anything
6308111 deal although i really think you owe me a freebie for that time you watched episode 6 of pride and prejudice a hundred times in a row

6308124 the farther out of hand the disease gets the harder its going to be to fix
6308125 for the tribes theres deep cultural and spiritual meaning there
6308126 people say oh you just want to turn the clock back and go back to the 1800s thats not the mission were not talking about millions of buffalo
6308127 were going to be watching to make sure theres continued management throughout the relocation process
6308128 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6308129 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6308130 profile of the chemical odours linked to skin cancer may lead to a day when diagnoses can be made by waving a scanner over the skin researchers told the annual conference of the american chemical society in philadelphia pennsylvania
6308131 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odours said chemist michelle gallagher who conducted the study at the monell chemical senses centre in philadelphia pennsylvania
6308132 a different profile of chemicals above tumour sites relative to healthy skin the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6308133 odour profile of all three forms of skin cancer including squamous cell cancer and melanoma the deadliest form
6308134 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6308135 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6308136 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6308137 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6308138 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6308139 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6308140 just the high alert status were at now these dogs are the quickest most easiest way to make sure that its not an explosive
6308141 especially in the united states if you see a k 9 with an officer theres a 99 percent chance that that animal was trained at lackland air force base
6308142 the victory over the georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations in russia
6308143 the troops were recently withdrawn from counter insurgency operations and kept for dealing with law and order problem
6308144 i have an habitual feeling of my real life having past and that i am leading a posthumous existence
6308145 do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul
6308146 like a weeping cloud that fosters the droop headed flowers all
6308147 ive been doing flowers since my first job i was 13 years old
6308148 back then it was cool the marlboro man on tv
6308149 ive put my life savings into this shop ive got quite of bit of inventory and i really cant afford to shut down and lose it all
6308150 its a nasty expensive habit but its what i have
6308151 i can deliver take orders wire flowers out get them in i just cant let the customers come in the store
6308152 we really dont want to tell anybody how their operating their restaurant store whatever
6308153 what we really need in this case is kind of a defined plan of operation and mash that up against our zoning code and the building code all the things that apply to any business smoking ordinance included
6308154 this is not hitler germany its just not but were slowly losing all of our rights
6308155 como si se tratara de la llegada al refugio m s extremo de la tierra
6308156 we are thrilled to officially own the property where our new hospital facility will be located
6308157 this has been a highly anticipated moment and we will now move forward in implementing the development and construction plans for our communitys new hospital facility
6308158 the communitys health care needs have been and will continue to be at the forefront as we develop and construct our new hospital
6308159 with features such as designated green spaces advanced technology and simplified access to our clinical services and patient destinations this facility will provide an optimal setting for efficient quality patient care in a nurturing and comfortable environment
6308160 we are a better football team than when we left on aug 9 and we are a better team than a year ago at this time
6308161 its great to be back and reconditioning ourselves to las vegas and our own fields there were a lot of distractions to deal with as far as coming back to campus so id say our practice tonight was not great probably just above average
6308162 we are excited about what they did to the fields while we were gone
6308163 hell get x rays on thursday and we should know more by the middle of the day
6308164 he came to us today and asked to come back and said he wants to be a member of this team now he has to earn his way back and earn the respect and trust of his teammates and coaches
6308165 but that could be dangerous for the whale because if it doesnt find a lactating female its just out there on its own and theres all sorts of sharks out there
6308166 we dont want to be stressing the whale out by whatever we choose to do
6308167 the thing thats coming home to us is whatever reason that caused the mother to abandon it may be the same reason causing other pods to reject it
6308168 until then the advice we have is that unless something miraculous happens like the mother whale turning up its looking bleak
6308169 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6308170 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6308171 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales
6308172 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
6308173 we must try to save this baby whale to do nothing is not an option we are happy to build a tourism industry around these beautiful creatures and now the time has come to pay it forward
6308174 attempts should be made to feed the whale we have the technology the personnel and the dollars that can be put behind the operation
6308175 the most humane thing though it is a terribly sad thing would be to put it down there is no point in prolonging its suffering in the foolish and arrogant presumption that we could save its life
6308176 fue sufrida estoy de acuerdo pero creo que m xico fue el mejor equipo de la cancha pudimos haber marcado tres goles en la primera parte honduras con un gran tr o libre se adelant en lo que fue su primera llegada
6308177 el equipo tuvo mucha voluntad son tres puntos que consigui ante un p blico incre ble un p blico bonito un estadio casi lleno y tenemos las tres unidades que quer amos
6308178 estos jugadores son grandes talentos del futbol mexicano son el presente y futuro de m xico cuentan con una calidad enorme
6308179 la selecci n de honduras jug muy bien pero m xico jug mejor honduras tiene jugadores con buena t cnica muy fuertes y gran velocidad
6308180 asked you to tell us your wildest nyc wishes and you did after receiving dreams of everything from feeding penguins to getting a posh new condo in brooklyn we broke out the fairy dust and granted our favorites
6308181 i was talking with someone who had lost his car it has been repossessed and his wifes car was also going to be repossessed in two weeks
6308182 how can you hope to find a job if you dont even have a car
6308183 the programs will be designed to evaluate each individuals job search readiness and provide help if needed
6308184 small groups or one on one programs to help improve their job search
6308185 you cant just walk up to someone and say you cant wear that to a job interview
6308186 its easy to see how people might get so depressed that they just turn around and leave
6308187 but the idea is that we can help one person at a time but we have to have the mentors and we have to have it clearly defined just how were going to help someone
6308188 maybe there will be a sympathetic eye to the other side
6308189 before this is ever going to be a viable project that is the reason why the dot said to look at your other one poplar first
6308190 as tight a budget as the state is in right now i dont see them doing anything right now
6308191 i dont know if any of us will ever see that interchange
6308192 i doubt you can confirm a dollar figure that they would be able to commit to
6308193 isnt the dot going to ask us how in the world that is going to be built
6308194 if you go back and get private commitment they may not
6308195 i think everybody is willing to say hey this is a good idea and we want to do this

6308197 at this point it does not look like were going to have a heavy agenda
6308198 the collection has been carefully created with some of the finest laces from around the world you will see a lot of satin and lace combined and rich colors such as burgundy and beige silver and peach as well as your classic black and white it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it

6308201 i feel in all honesty this indeed may be the real deal and i say this carefully after reviewing information that has been shared privately with me
6308202 we now have everything we need from griffin and spalding

6308204 any designated route which significantly features certain intrinsic qualities that should be protected or enhanced
6308205 make the public aware of this historic trail and propose to the georgia dot to designate it a scenic byway
6308206 we have an awful lot to offer for a byway and this would be a major tourism mechanism for our county
6308207 our next step will be to go to all the folks who live along the route and ask them for their support as well

6308213 die bundesregierung hat sich zum ziel gesetzt dass im jahr 2020 insgesamt 14 prozent der genutzten w rme aus erneuerbaren energien stammt das k nnen wir nur schaffen wenn auch unternehmen und freiberufler in erneuerbare energien investieren deshalb bietet das marktanreizprogramm f r unternehmen jetzt bessere f rderbedingungen denn je damit wird das marktanreizprogramm zum investitionsmotor f r erneuerbare energien
6308214 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6308215 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6308216 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6308217 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6308218 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet

6308240 we spent 250 000 on the site last year and again this year to bring it up to where it should be
6308241 ive voted against 345 billion in new spending in this congress and since 2001 ive voted against over 1 trillion in new spending
6308242 i have always co authored a balanced budget amendment to the u s constitution and my starting answer for all new spending requests is no and yes is very hard to earn
6308243 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6308244 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations

6308264 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6308265 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6308266 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6308267 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6308268 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6308269 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to

6308283 she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6308284 deciding what to do with wheat once harvested depends on moisture content
6308285 when moisture content is more than 22 farmers should be thinking about crimping farmers who dont have spare clamps can use ag bag type plastic silos in the field
6308286 anything with water content less than 20 could be rolled and treated with propionic aid
6308287 adding a 3 inclusion into wheat and 5 for barley takes the seed coat off and preserves it the advantages with caustic treatment is that it can be store up to 12 months in a barn doesnt need clamping and can be moved around
6308288 and although caustic soda is costing 550 t it allows flexibility and with whole grain you get better performance
6308289 crimping and adding an additive can produce high energy and high starch products with an me of 13 5 which is slowly degradable in the rumen
6308290 storing can take place with temporary clamps on hard concrete which requires weight on top and strict management to create an anaerobic environment ag bags although more expensive create good fermentation and are easier to manage it is also important farmers manage the face of the clamp to prevent any damage
6308291 farmers need to be patient and shouldnt be baling up wet straw
6308292 special attention needs to be made to getting it dry and clean in terms of bedding wet straw wont be as absorbent and unless we get dry weather straw could be critical
6308293 bedding dairy cattle on wet straw will create a challenge all winter and there will be a constant battle against cells counts and mastitis
6308294 dairy farmers should maybe look into long term investments by installing mattresses which will require less bedding and will have a short payback period other alternatives include paper based products saw dust and rape straw
6308295 corners must not be cut and straw must be included in the ration as hay and silage dont have the scratch factor and production will be affected

6308314 we have already decided that chairman upendra yadav would lead the mprf team in the government
6308315 the leaders will be prepared to consider the suspension of the fiji interim government from the councils of the forum
6308316 its a very strong message and now the ball is in bainimaramas court as to how he responds
6308317 this is about pacific island forum leaders assuming leadership of this issue
6308318 the commodore wants to consider very carefully before he walks that road
6308319 the thing is hes not only ruled out march 2009 he actually has no timetable for elections at any time so theres just not a willingness on his part up until now to look at any timetable
6308320 he may be the only starter in the game that could literally throw one pitch and win 20 games every year
6308321 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs against one of the games best pitchers

6308323 how do you shop for care when youre having a heart attack
6308324 we take these reports very seriously and use these opportunities to continually improve
6308325 because of that we are able to open closed arteries in a timely and efficient manner which translates directly into increased survival and lower mortality
6308326 this perhaps is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo can bestow to show animals are very much like ourselves and feel elation and pain
6308327 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
6308328 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
6308329 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
6308330 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6308331 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
6308332 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
6308333 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
6308334 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

6308347 one of the first things mccain did after 9 11 was go on just about every tv program where he incidentally called for attacking about four countries
6308348 sounded the alarm ratcheted up the rhetoric and often called for military action with almost no regards to the practical implications of such an approach

6308373 the fourth monday in august is really in my opinion family friendly and its putting money in our classrooms
6308374 i cant say the delayed start date didnt have an effect but theres obviously other variables
6308375 the school districts were so against having a uniform start date that theyre not ever going to admit theres any benefit
6308376 when you look at august to august utility bills there were savings even though electricity rates went up this was a smart move
6308377 the tourism industry pushed very hard and successfully to move the school start date later in the year to no sooner than the last monday of august
6308378 the argument was that cities would benefit from increased sales taxes meanwhile districts have less time to prepare for taks and midyear holidays must be truncated or eliminated altogether
6308379 i really think the legislature would be well advised to give local boards the opportunity to set their start times
6308380 i understand why theyre not happy i do but in the legislature you have to look at the bigger picture
6308381 if you can subtract some august days from your air conditioning bill you cant help but to save money

6308384 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6308385 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6308386 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6308395 i knew what he was going through i wasnt guessing and saying oh this must really hurt i knew what he was experiencing because i was experiencing it myself
6308396 the turning point for me was when i started counting my blessings

6308403 ace stated in part this is a conspiracy to commit murder
6308404 didnt match the witnesses statements including those who survived the accident
6308405 tickets sold out in minutes at 9am on the dot there were 6000 people on our website while the rest were sold just minutes later
6308406 oasis is one of the hottest tickets weve had for a while and everyone wanted one we had 50 per cent of the allocation with their official website having the other half
6308407 we are delighted oasis are making a return to the secc this highlights we are one of the premiere venues for live music in scotland and we are delighted theyre back
6308408 oasis were previously the fastest selling act to visit the aecc and this time theyve sold out faster
6308409 it is amazing when you consider its for two nights and other shows are just one some 17 000 tickets sold in seven minutes which is as fast as the box office could process the sales
6308410 and you have a situation that the rest of the world views with shock and incomprehension
6308411 its a pretty traditional criminal law that accomplices and co conspirators are equally held culpable
6308412 you dont have to specifically agree to commit a killing you agree to commit the target crime then any other crimes that are foreseeable youre responsible
6308413 flies in the face of a broader effort to reserve the death penalty for extreme cases
6308414 they argued clearly and unambiguously that reneau was the bad actor

6308685 a friend that doesnt mind holding hands with you a friend you kissed on the cheek it sounds more like youre dating him

6308687 youre keen on your information i can have something charged against you for doing an illegal search
6308688 i havent done anything wrong i have access to all the databases around the world not hard to find any info i havent tampered with evidence or killed anyone you know i can get myself out of it because i tear down every argument you throw at me bit by bit
6308689 if you werent such a prude maybe i would sleep with you and not have to do what i do
6308690 im sorry i havent given it to you you have to wait for our wedding night which is in well a year from now

6308699 hes filming a movie right now too so im just as shocked
6308700 i need to watch some of this guys works because you keep talking about him
6308701 you should theyre really good and impressed me before meeting him in person
6308702 i feel burned im wondering which private investigator james got through to watch me everyone is scared of me except you
6308703 well you can see who timed in and out on that particular day
6308704 exactly i will get the person to make him or her spill their guts
6308705 you should have booked a flight kytana i dont get why you want to drive for 7 hours
6308706 i havent taken a long drive in quite a while it gives me time to relax before i have to keep my squealing to myself acting like a fangirl in front of other fangirls is going to be interesting
6308707 why thank you i guess im scary all the time for the guy who decided to just take me out to dinner when he first met me
6308708 i didnt see you threatening in any way you stood out in the crowd
6308709 i was going to wear jeans a purple tank top and a black buttoned shirt why
6308710 you americans are very simple this is a premiere i would expect to see you full out styled w a skirt or a dress
6308711 there wasnt a dress code for this i wanted to be comfortable
6308712 despite there is no dress code i expect to see you with nice attire on
6308713 cant i just be comfortable im not going in rags
6308714 im saying that normally here in japan when there is a premiere i always see everyone wearing something nice a bit formal wear isnt it like it in the us
6308715 if its at a big venue and a huge event ive never been to one this is a small one at the university of southern california well i guess its big because youre going to be there and we never see you guys here
6308716 never mind too bad i wont see you after the premiere you have to fly back
6308717 who says im not going to see you privately at the premiere hhmmm
6308718 now i know you want to say something just spill it
6308719 fine fine please dont demand me on how to dress or what my attitude should be it really reminds me of james i mean ive been to events and every time i always have to dress as he says and even be fake sorry i dont mean to be sensitive
6308720 the attitude is quite similar i will defend you by saying that youre famous and thats your job youre rich on top of that and can be refined whenever you want thats james too im honestly wishing i took back the yes when he asked me but then he threatened me
6308721 kytana listen i dont mean to sound demanding i didnt know that something this small would affect you im sorry
6308722 its ok jun i know you didnt mean it to hurt me im sorry to compare you to him
6308723 i still plan to see you after the premiere its been a long time you know
6308724 jun what happens if we get caught im not staying at a rich hotel like you would some of the girls are going to be staying there too
6308725 i dont care ill be disguised and no one can recognize me
6308726 you absolutely sure we dont have to see each other ill already see you on stage
6308727 this is why i cant wait to hug you again
6308728 i really should go i need my energy for the drive
6308729 something happened that you had to follow me all the way here i have a feeling already i know who it is but i would like to hear your story
6308730 look i had to do it or my sister and mother would be prosecuted for a murder that doesnt exist
6308731 he made me do this or i would lose my job
6308732 fucking hell now hes going after my friends you guys should be smart enough to say no were private investigators we shouldnt be scared of anything
6308733 for christs sake i cant take a vacation to see my favorite idol or watch a good movie because hes wanting to know my every move
6308734 james wants to play a game right well well looks like i have some work to do meet me at my room tonight i know you followed me so you know where to go you know my cell now come on i want to watch the movie because its supposed to be good
6308735 you are going to give this back to me when we meet up or else
6308736 this is for all the guests with your success what future projects shows or even animation will we see in the next 5 10 years
6308737 hes from japan how the hell am i going to sleep with someone who doesnt live in the united states
6308738 dont you ever think girls are looking this way because youre hot
6308739 you are in denial would it be different i told you that you were hot
6308740 ever since we became friends you were one person i couldnt get my eyes off of goodness luckily im not going to kill you for abiding james favor
6308741 thank you so when do we go back to your hotel room
6308742 jun or the movie because all im gonna say is that i died
6308743 uh i cant i have to be up early tomorrow to drive back
6308744 its okay next time then well see each other on vox
6308745 its because its hard to open to a guy for me girls are a bit easier and since we all know each other online its not as bad
6308746 if i knew that then i wouldnt have thought that way you seriously need to lighten up around us you know how many of us like you more than a friend
6308747 i dont like being close to a guy after being with james it scares me and i like being myself
6308748 this is unreal you actually know the idol himself thats what every girl dreams of
6308749 you sure you arent gay walt the way youre acting sounds like youre a fan
6308750 apparently james hired walter to take pictures and report on me because he threatened him ugh i officially hate him
6308751 no far from it hes very shy and gentle maybe gay too
6308752 hey dont be saying weird stuff about me in another language thats rude
6308753 yeah put it this way since im his fianc james doesnt understand that i can access his place i put the devices in after the time he proposed to me no one knows the story why im with him
6308754 yes unfortunately i dont love the guy at all hes trying to use my family and friends against me in any way so if they comply it gets harder for me to reject him from the moment i was forced into the engagement i had to think of something to keep myself covered i teased him one night and placed 4 webcams around his room
6308755 its not a good reason not to mention that it maybe illegal or invading privacy
6308756 and hiring you to take pictures of me and my friend here is dont be siding with him now
6308757 good now give me your sd card i want to see what pictures you have
6308758 looks like nothing scandalous you are not showing him these almost naked pictures though
6308759 no were friends and seriously we both cannot be together
6308760 whew good so if james asks me ill be prepared
6308761 walter go to your room jun and i have something to discuss because he wont be in town for long
6308762 please we havent seen each other since last year because were both busy people
6308763 fine fine dont do anything that would get you into trouble then
6308764 i know if i see new pictures given to james though you know i will hunt you down and give you more of a reason to be dead instead of living
6308765 jun i dont know about this i feel like well this is not fair to you youre willing to be with me even if i have a fianc i dont know how i feel about you
6308766 hai on one hand being with you has made me happier on the other my reality is to marry james i cant get out of it without hurting anyone
6308767 i still want to be with you maybe im one the insane to tell the truth
6308768 gomen jun i think this just pulled the strings walter showed up here because he was hired by james
6308769 no im just some kind of trophy to him because im an international private investigator if he marries me then hell get access to all the databases all over the world i wish i could reject him but i cant hes willing to accuse my partner friends and family for crimes that they never committed
6308770 i guess anyone around me gets into this unnecessary complicated mess
6308771 hai i know i put myself into this so i pay the price of not having privacy this is why i cherish moments like these where there are no cameras
6308772 are you sure you want to be with me i dont want to cause you trouble because of everything
6308773 yes its not because youre an idol i think its because i have a fianc and youd get fed up with me certainly you can have any girl youd like and most would faint
6308774 i will settle for that answer then i apologize for my actions too i guess i havent had someone in a long time and well youre
6308775 why didnt you tell me you had a sexy body underneath your clothes
6308776 i guess i should grateful you feel that way about me
6308777 hai youre not like a lot of girls i dated and normally this never happened
6308778 james called me and i told him what we talked about
6308779 now hes checking up on you like a little panzy oi what was his response
6308780 he didnt believe that you were alone even though i e mailed him the photos he wants me to do some research on jun since hes the person you went to see
6308781 whats he going to find that hes a famous jpop idol in japan and every girl adores him thats what youll see too
6308782 oh hell no thats an illegal search what is he thinking plus only the director and i know our codes for work you cant look outside of the united states jurisdiction unless you are me or jonathan
6308783 i dont know he sounds upset and he wants to know whats going on with you maybe he loves you that much
6308784 love god that seems to be the theme today he doesnt love me walter theres no way he didnt even date me to know who i am
6308785 no wonder he doesnt know anything about you that makes a lot of sense
6308786 dont be siding with him walter you were threatened too what bugs me is that he has a lot of time on his hands to figure me out doesnt he have any cases that need attention or someone to prosecute sheesh
6308787 he lost 3 cases in a row it took a toll on the law firm he worked for because he never lost the defense attorneys chosen were top notch
6308788 it seems that my world is turning around slowly for the better
6308789 i dont care he deserves to finally get spoken to in a professional manner
6308790 going back to the current situation what do you want me to do id get fired in a second if i start working on this
6308791 leave it to me give me your personal e mail address and i will do my own search the director will want an explanation if i say its for james we dont have to see him again
6308792 i dont like where this is going wait maybe i do
6308793 trust me if he wants to try into my personal life hell get everything horrible back times a thousand
6308794 youre very important to me im willing to wait for you
6308795 i missed you over the weekend how was your la trip
6308796 it was great i had a lot of a fun
6308797 dont push it james im here to work not argue with you
6308798 you upset me greatly i should be with you wherever you go
6308799 uh huh dont you have work to do thats what you get paid for
6308800 i might as well do you right now while your partner is not here
6308801 what dont you want to have a man like me
6308802 fine just remember that i will keep my eye on you
6308803 he thinks im his freaking property jonathan im tired of it im not his stinking pet he could follow around when i go on vacation
6308804 calm down i know youre not you really need to break off the engagement with him pronto
6308805 i know yet hes going to just use it against me and then go to a court hearing i dont know im so wait i have something to do
6308806 uh oh another one of kytanas schemes by the way hows jun
6308807 very good hes been very busy and even took the time to see me
6308808 ummm dont you know enough about jun to not research him
6308809 covered up thanks to johnny kitagawa then again i guess no one is perfect this is going to bother me
6308810 i wanted to see how you were doing i miss you
6308811 i dont know just a guess well maybe its just me
6308812 you and i work a lot so this maybe is normal to us
6308813 i was doing some research on the johnnys i read some things about the arashi members
6308814 i want to know if the underage smoking and sex were true
6308815 calm down my girlfriend is researching me because shes paranoid you can ask me those questions instead of your research ugh
6308816 kytana what do you plan to accomplish with this information
6308817 it would be nice if you let me explain why im doing it before you yell
6308818 its not nice to know your gathering information on me you reacted the same way when james did this
6308819 dont go i i really miss you i dont mean to yell gomen its just that youre looking into my life thats disturbing
6308820 its my job if you didnt notice i can find anything about anyone by all this will you listen to what i have to say this
6308821 ok im doing this for walter why so james can leave him and me alone when you were sleeping at my hotel room that night walter called me to talk he told james what happened and wanted him to do research under my database only jonathan and i have the access codes this is what we call illegal access so i decided to help out and research about you which doesnt pertaining to a case i havent heard from the boss but they normally spot these things a week after im waiting to get scolded i sent him the info through personal e mail and to give it to james
6308822 this is the best part ive got it planned my director will ask me into the office about the search i will explain that james asked walter and me to research on someone whos outside of his jurisdiction my director doesnt like james just to let you know once i tell him he authorized it he will ban james from entering our firm and tell his firm what happened he hasnt won any cases lately the reasoning is because hes trying to keep an eye on me ever since last summer
6308823 yes if that wont convince him i have some evidence thatll personally make james hated by him more
6308824 okay i see you are trying to save your friend and not having to see james at the office then that makes sense
6308825 yes thats what i wanted to explain before you started yelling
6308826 gomen its just lately a lot of things has stressed me out what gets us in trouble are scandals which can be reported to tabloids jun explained
6308827 i understand and you know i wouldnt expose you it upset me to see the info which is why i mentioned it still were they true
6308828 yes they were those were the days i was stupid and learning
6308829 souka i didnt see any current research but man johnny covered your ass
6308830 thats why im careful with you i dont want them knowing were together because i dont want you involved
6308831 sheesh thats me here too im not famous but i have a crazy fianc
6308832 there are two things i needs to discuss i will start off with this
6308833 you going after someone whos not in our country kytana i want to know when you were going to get my permission for this assignment
6308834 oh really why would he ask my firm to do some research on this japanese idol
6308835 walter explained to me he needed my help on this james hired him to conduct international research apparently walter was threatened and needed my help so as a favor i took it upon myself to research this japanese idol james says that hell run it through you and i guess he never did i dont want walter to get into trouble for the work ive done if anything you can go ahead and fire me
6308836 i see i wont tolerate unauthorized work james is not part of this law firm and will be banned from coming here again you may want to tell him tell him he will get a restraining order if he doesnt abide what i want
6308837 from the moment i met him hes just worthless he doesnt know how much work is put into our positions not to mention ive done my own research and hes getting information illegally i dont like that at all
6308838 please do besides i wouldnt want to fire one of my best investigators youre too important for the company along with jonathan
6308839 no worries you did a great job on it too this japanese idol is lucky to have you as a fan
6308840 yet i wouldnt want you to get in trouble by leaking this out so keep this as for your personal info to read about him
6308841 thank you very much i didnt know you knew i liked him
6308842 no no its nice to see you smile so dont stop just be professional okay
6308843 i understand youll start having training sessions with me starting tomorrow on being an attorney here itll take the course of a month
6308844 i shouldnt keep you any further go home and rest now i will see you in the morning
6308845 i was called in to speak to the director he had some important business with me
6308846 ok ok ummm i will guess that its something to do with the illegal research
6308847 damn you anyways he hates james which made me happy he cant come here ever again or hell make sure that he gets a restraining order
6308848 the director became cooler in my book now thats good
6308849 and no one is fired walter owes me big time for this oh also starting tomorrow ill be an attorney
6308850 had to keep it a secret it was under direct orders
6308851 i dont think so ill beg him to still have you partnered up with me on investigation im not leaving this department ever i love it too much

6308880 it is quite clear from all the available evidence that this would be a wholly inappropriate site for quarrying
6308881 this would amount to an unacceptable level of industrialisation of this semi rural location
6308882 in addition to the loss of amenity dust and noise will be generated that will detriment not just chilton itself but also great waldingfield and acton and the wider area for a minimum of 10 years
6308883 the currently projected 20 228 new heavy vehicle movements a year that would be generated to and from the site all of it via the notoriously dangerous a134 will put an unacceptable burden on the local road network in terms of excess traffic and reduced road safety
6308884 as the mp for the area i might be expected to object to this scheme wholly on the basis of the immense weight of local opposition to it however i would add that as a former environment minister with personal experience of judging planning appeals of this nature i am firmly of the view that this site is economically and environmentally unsustainable in what is a semi rural and residential part of suffolk

6308891 it was an excellent event we all really enjoyed it and the public were great we had lots of really positive support especially all the children they loved it

6308894 although residents have been consulted in inquiries by network rail and her majestys rail inspectorate who are the statutory bodies in this matter i feel it is important that we at essex county council make further efforts to see that the views of local residents are heard
6308895 therefore i have asked for the consultation process we began on july 11 to be allowed more time and for network rail to delay their works due to commence on august 26 for a little longer
6308896 although there is no choice about the main part of these works to replace the manual gates with automated ones we may yet be able to use this opportunity to provide a better solution for the people of frinton on sea
6308897 we are surprised by this media release given the ongoing dialogue and relationship we have with the essex county council
6308898 network rail has already taken part in a briefing and consultation exercise over these works and the resulting improvements to the local road network which was supported by the essex county council
6308899 we have secured approval from the council and an approval in principle from the office of rail regulation hm railway inspectorate suffolk homes
6308900 this is a festival where we swing the gods in a way we show our gratitude by serving the god for giving us all we wished for we feel happy doing this because we keep asking favors from god during our prayers
6308901 it should be celebrated with a lot of pomp and fervor so that we do not forget our traditional culture and can preserve our age old culture the swings made in different designs and colours for god

6308944 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgement
6308945 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabres and look for a military solution
6308946 and the republicans havent been very good at governing but theyre very good at running negative ads
6308947 its important we strip away all the political nonsense and just understand whats at stake in this election
6308948 yesterday tuesday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i am questioning his patriotism
6308949 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6308950 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses

6309020 hoy ha habido una enorme tragedia para la ciudad de madrid es un acontecimiento que nos deja a todos con sensaci n de profundo dolor y tambi n de impotencia
6309021 esa no es la manera como pensamos que debe ser un campe n
6309022 no tengo ning n problema con que haga un espect culo
6309023 creo que deber a respetar m s a los otros competidores y darles un apret n de manos una palmada en el hombro a los otros despu s de cruzar la meta y no hacer gestos como los que hizo en los 100 metros

6309029 los juegos ol mpicos nos demostraron que tenemos que seguir estoy orgullosa de mi equipo por todo lo que hicimos antes de llegar a este d a creo que los juegos te ayudan a aprender y por eso espero poder estar en los pr ximos
6309030 mas m xico nuestro equipo mostr mucha voluntad y realiz un buen juego
6309031 les perdonamos la vida las dos situaciones que se presentaron claras creo que fueron trascendentales en el marcador un 2 0 hubiera sido diferente quiz s hubi ramos aprovechado la desesperaci n de m xico
6309032 creo que m xico fue el mejor equipo de la cancha
6309033 pudimos haber marcado tres goles en la primera parte honduras con un gran tiro libre se adelant en su primera llegada
6309034 la selecci n de honduras jug muy bien pero m xico jug mejor honduras tiene jugadores con buena t cnica muy fuertes y de gran velocidad
6309035 nosotros hab amos dicho que lo importante eran los tres puntos y ah est n hay que mejorar en lo futbol stico

6309057 when you hear the descriptions of what the rescue workers found when they got to the scene of the stricken aircraft it seems almost incredible that anyone survived a fireball such as this
6309058 the focus of the investigation will now be on what exactly happened to that plane in the last few seconds as it reached the end of the runway
6309059 the plane was totally broken apart it was all full of bodies
6309060 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6309061 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6309062 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6309063 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6309064 it flies throughout spain and internationally and has a good accident record
6309065 it appears at the moment to have been some sort of engine problem

6309071 any attempt to break up baa will be resisted this union and our members will not sit back while the market plays games with their jobs and their terms and conditions of employment
6309072 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6309073 to give a guarantee for the full four years would be to say we are not going to have any private funding success i am absolutely confident we will
6309074 there is no panic and there is no downgrading of our aspirations for 2012 we all have a vested interest in having the strongest team in london
6309075 the very first thing players will notice when they start playing is the
6309076 i can best describe it as the game just feels
6309077 the sluggishness combined with the 2 second gcd and the fact that no abilities are off of the gcd make for a very clunky pvp experience i often feel like im fighting the game more than the actual player
6309078 there is simply a delay from when you execute an ability to when it fires to character animation to seeing damage onscreen and finally to when your hotbar clears and is ready for the next input
6309079 want a shot rotation on your sh or sw sorry but from the amount of delay between autoshots firing after special attacks to the cast bar simply disappearing to animations never syncing to damage or sound effects it will be a very challenging road
6309080 is combat fun meh sorry guys but i will agree with some of the haters in that even after the patch combat feels alittle slow largely due to the global cd being on every ability and i believe it is too long and because as i said before the combat isnt distinct in sound and presentation as it needs to be
6309081 it is alittle tedious when you have 3 people hitting a tank and you know that tank is going down and he knows he is going down but everyone just kind of sits there bored spamming damage attacks on the guy till he drops there is no excitement to moments like these
6309082 the speed of combat needs to increase and the abilities need to be made flashier
6309083 combat melee combat and targeting is still a little off and so is the casting melee i cannot explain this one but it is just off very hard to get it right
6309084 while collision detection for enemies is fantastic collision detection for friendly players is awful trying to maneuver in a heated battle only to be stopped by a tiny little gobby while playing a bo or chosen or breaking down a keep door at watching 50 people try to cram through a little tiny gap or simply trying to get to a location and having some asshats block your path is not my idea of fun collision detection is implemented as a cylinder around your character that is normalized for all players
6309085 we are honored to have made the inc 500 5000 list this year
6309086 none of our competition even comes close to providing the services that we do for our customers we go the extra mile here at rac and thats the bottom line we have experienced rapid growth in the past few years and this is only the beginning of our next chapter
6309087 im signing up my companies to workplace giving and im hoping my 3 000 employees will be as enthusiastic as i am about the scheme to be able to give charities an extra 900 million a year at no extra cost to yourself the question you should be asking is not why would you do this its why wouldnt you
6309088 over 25 of our employees have signed up to this scheme since we launched it 12 months ago and through their giving they support over 200 individual charities we are delighted to further encourage them by adding 1 to every 2 they donate and the total is of course finally enhanced by a further donation from the government the administrative aspect is truly minimal so i ask the same question as duncan why on earth wouldnt you promote the scheme
6309089 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages

6309150 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6309151 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6309162 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6309163 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture not just as an accident
6309164 an important signal but there is also important substance to it

6309210 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6309211 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6309212 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6309213 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6309214 theres an important message here and we need to ensure it is translated into preventative work in pregnant women to reduce the risk

6309241 improving sexual health is a government health priority so increasing the range of condoms available can only be good in terms of encouraging safe sex practices
6309242 condoms are already funded and always have been this decision sees a 10 per cent price reduction for all condoms which frees up funds that can be used to purchase other new medicines
6309243 morally bankrupt and an insult to people with breast cancer high blood pressure and heart disease
6309244 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms

6309266 this concert attracted thousands of young teenage girls who screamed incessantly on the street for hours for their idols blocking traffic injuring one resident in the crush and inconveniencing scores of other people and businesses
6309267 flood lights on the roof often kept on all night glaring into peoples homes
6309268 crowds for apple soho on a regular basis that necessitate police barricades adding to pedestrian crowding preventing access to high end businesses on greene street and subsequent diminution of income as well as restricting residents access to their homes
6309269 subsequent litter left by these crowds who often number in the hundreds and who line up and even camp out overnight on public sidewalks giving soho the appearance of a homeless encampment

6309336 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
6309337 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy

6309340 there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all
6309341 a version of this article appeared in print on august 10 2008 on page ar1 of the new york edition
6309342 can we sit at your right hand and your left hand in your kingdom p 77
6309343 the task of future christian leaders is not to make a little contribution to the solution of the pains and tribulations of their time but to identify and announce the ways in which jesus is leading gods people out of slavery through the desert to a new land of freedom
6309344 to manifest the divine event of gods saving work in the midst of the many seemingly random events of their time
6309345 no i think the residence inn just knows how much you like pancakes
6309346 oh i didnt get it man what do you call it when someone is slow at something
6309347 we dont link humanitarian aid to political issues such as the nuclear issue
6309348 if only there was a way to avoid the painful trials ahead
6309349 i will guide you the constant heartbreak the loneliness the feeling of having no control these can be avoided follow me and i will show you many of the lessons that must be learned
6309350 would it not be better to throw myself into initial error is not error the best way to success
6309351 no your heart does not need to be shattered to realize its lessons do successful marriages come from a series of failed ones of course not for
6309352 she is out of my league she would never go for someone like me
6309353 change is gradual before you saw no opportunities now you see them all about you yet you are too hesitant to take them youre slowly becoming more aware
6309354 when you find yourself hesitant always yield to action if you see her do not wait gawk or wait for a perfect moment action action action
6309355 pook i cannot you see i am insecure i dont have that confidence
6309356 you are confusing cause and effect the cause of your hesitant nature is not because of your insecurity you have not gotten what youve wanted what youve desired that is the cause of your hesitant nature
6309357 you are caught in the vicious cycle you are hesitant because you are not used for things going your way and things will never go your way because you remain hesitant you see what you want become hesitant and the door of opportunity closes it happens again and again and again with each choice towards inaction you reject yourself a little bit more
6309358 if there is a choice between less pain or the possibility of more pain we default to the less pain in adolescence going for a girl and failing made you think everyone else would laugh at you whether or not it was true you thought it was true this was how you were kept within the cycle
6309359 by realizing that the choice of inaction is more painful than action childhood is over you are the man you must approach always default to action now from those of us who wasted years in that hesitation mode know that rejection is always better than regret always
6309360 they do not know how great you are you are beautiful lovely enchanting dazzling in every way and they are idiots when they cannot see it
6309361 let me tell you more of my problems with men
6309362 i thought that through friendship love would eventually spring how wrong i was a friend she sees a friend you be
6309363 but why pook why is friendship hopeless i fall in love with my female friends do they not do the same
6309364 oh woman pray tell why do you not go after your male friends
6309365 yes my male friends constantly fall in love with me
6309366 and speak truly madam what do you and your male friends do
6309367 why it is a difference between the sexes young man what do you do with your friends
6309368 but do you and your guy friends ever sit around and talk about your feelings and things going on in your life
6309369 there is your answer men do not get together and just talk we do things when we are with our women friends we talk much more since we reserve our talking sharing emotions and experiences to our romantic interest we get confused with our female friends we begin to get interested in them because of this
6309370 women usually arent used to getting together and doing pure action so when they do so with their guy friends they get a bit confused as well
6309371 so avoid the friendship route when you see a woman you are interested in go for her romantically for a friend she sees a friend you shall always be
6309372 it is all women mother nature herself this nasty sphinx devours all hearts and lives of those who cannot answer her riddle that man in the picture he figured out the riddle to woman thus he became known as don juan
6309373 is that there is no riddle woman is a sphinx with no secret it is only our minds that we assign her secrets mysteries pedestals and goddess like status
6309374 look at the above example look at how the lad got stood up over and over and yet over and over he rationalized the standing up how often is it that a lad rationalizes signals to his liking how often is it that a lad offers gifts and treasures as sacrifices to her goddess likeness for in his mind she is a goddess how often is it that a lads overactive imagination converts her disrespect her shallowness her flaws into love
6309375 exactly judge by her actions and not by her words judge by what she does than by what your mind wants to see our vanity will convert the image of every disinterested girl into secretly loving us for women tell us what we want to hear this is why we must judge by her actions and not by her words
6309376 i will be patient and let the cards fall where they may
6309377 how can patience be confidence isnt confidence courage isnt confidence action how is patience courageous or action
6309378 now let us summon up a don juan and observe his mannerisms
6309379 hear me oh don juan there are women around and other men are hitting on them what is your reaction
6309380 these other guys are going to take his women how can he be so laid back
6309381 he is laid back because he knows how great a catch he is and that getting women is easy he knows he is the prince
6309382 i should have kissed her i have been following philosophies and not being myself i should follow my inner nature and
6309383 why the food is right in front of him his nose smells it his eyes see it he drools
6309384 and so is the same with women what does the kid do next
6309385 his senses all tell him to do so he knows when to eat because the food has been all prepared has been cooked and is presented before him
6309386 and so is it the same with women they have been prepared through decades of aging and growth for this purpose they dream it they want it oh heavens do they want it they have been warmed through your fun through your attention through their desire through your desire they are presented through themselves do you think she is wearing what she does for herself no she is wearing it for you women are not ornaments to be admired they are there to be consumed you know it they know it
6309387 nature has a system in place no philosophy in the world can do you any good the philosophies that supposedly work are the ones that best match natures music you either can flow with the system and get what you want or you can buck it in pain so listen to that gut
6309388 it is because they dont know how good you are
6309389 the only constant is i what if it is something i keep doing
6309390 why am i acting like a beggar i am smart handsome have a future and women ought to work to get me
6309391 goody that means i get to be passive to continue to indulge in my vaporous habits and not do a thing to alter myself i like to hear that because it means i am perfect as i am and ought not change for anyone
6309392 foolish youth if you are not changed by life then you are not living life only those who are not altered by life are those totally unaware of it
6309393 before us are two youths who are on the threshold of life both have the same origins yet the destinations are different let us look at the first one
6309394 i cherished her i bought her flowers everyday i sang her sonnets i always told her i loved her
6309395 he was after all just being himself now for the second young man
6309396 that they are stuck in a type of stasis i have changed they acknowledge that but they are exactly the same
6309397 the second one is always getting better the first one is always staying the same if not getting worse
6309398 exactly it is the difference between rotting and ripening be the good fruit be the prize to be won
6309399 i need to do this and this at work today it would be wonderful if you would go get the supplies for me
6309400 by pleasing her whims i lost track of mine a servant youll be a friend shell see as
6309401 im not equipped to answer such a question let us ask a great philosopher
6309402 attention socrates you have been summoned did you know that answer the question that is respect
6309403 thats an easy one pook where there is reverence there is fear but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence
6309404 oh wise sage salient soul respect is the realization of set boundaries after all how can reverence become without any sense of fear of you walking away for true passion with women can only come when the man can easily walk away the great catch walking away is womans great fear
6309405 yes now let us ask a question to that opposite sex arise woman
6309406 answer this riddle why do men who are willing to walk away turn you on
6309407 didnt everyone know this a man that can walk away means that he has his pick of the litter and the woman can easily be replaced you wont find the lawyer or doctor or politician be entangled to a woman at first
6309408 so the great catch is always willing to walk away
6309409 the great catch is respect she is supposed to celebrate life with you not use you as a peon be a man and respect attends to itself
6309410 are entirely sexual creatures they do not respond to your intellectualism they do not respond to your genius they only respond to sexuality
6309411 most men are scared of their sexuality look at the chumps they are not men they are androgynous they are ape like
6309412 the woman has invited the nice guy to her pleasure palace
6309413 why he is not being male he is not being what he is enough
6309414 here the nice guy is leeching off the woman in a pathetic friendship way
6309415 what mr nice guy no way he could never have a penis
6309416 what do you want a relationship with a girl to be about
6309417 do you want to talk about dna or genetics all day
6309418 then stop talking to her about dna and genetics stop talking to her about geek things you do not need another lab partner
6309419 then embrace your own sexuality be a guy talk like a guy act like a guy do action things it is one thing to talk about things you love but most guys talk about things just to talk
6309420 sexualize myself my appearance and my actions and the women will naturally follow
6309421 when you have that connection with someone that warm safe and comfortable feeling right there then what sometimes can happen is
6309422 guides you shall learn and memorize the booklets of societal situations with women
6309423 thou shall never stay on the phone longer than twenty minutes
6309424 these guides and rules were a clutch for my lack of confidence they do however work but are overall limited
6309425 the rules and guides are the training wheels the helper out of the nest
6309426 if the rules and guides were successful why would he abandon them
6309427 because he realized he was successful not by the rules and guides but by the approaching and fun mindset the rules and guides demanded
6309428 nothing but it is critical to realize the purpose of scripts and guides
6309429 the point of manual is not to grant you success if you do you will forever be under his dictatorship the entire reason why manual exists is to not grant you success but illustrate the means of success
6309430 meaning that a few people became successful and formed manual out from the clay of their knowledge manual is their automaton their robot to consistently answer newbies questions the end goal in seduction in success is to make it natural when it becomes natural you have no need for manual and can handle anything women throw at you
6309431 i used to think women were nice and charming that only bad boys were the problem this knowledge is shattering every ideal i held about women
6309432 but i am myself i will never change for anybody
6309433 you do not have muscles what makes you think you can get hot women
6309434 you are not that smart why do you think you can get the pick of the group
6309435 you do not have a high paying job why do you think you deserve a hottie
6309436 you are not as cute or handsome as the other guys therefore you do not deserve a hot chick
6309437 and so long as you think so long you remain free
6309438 but pook what are you a self improvement seminar where is the woman in this
6309439 women come and go but you are forever the focus must be on you what do you want in a girl what do you want to do for a date what type of relationship are you looking for it is a machine to the one you push the button and out she comes
6309440 but pook what if she does not like your date ideas what if she is different from what you are looking for
6309441 then she is not for you the thing girls hate is when you cannot have a date idea which happens to guys because they want to please her without thinking of themselves you have a series of hobbies and tastes if she likes your date ideas then that is good if she doesnt then go get another girl there are billions out there
6309442 only if you place the focus on the woman if you do that then you actually believe it is women who are making the choice not you there is no rejection you are merely finding out if she has good taste after all she is looking for a guy that fits her interests and tastes if she doesnt like you for whatever reason let her and thank her for doing so
6309443 which would you prefer a woman who collapses her own interests for the sakes of yours merely to have a boyfriend or a woman who likes you because of you
6309444 indeed now think back to your nice guy days those suffering days of endless agreement and non confrontation what service did you do to help find compatibility
6309445 look into the valley look at how man has fallen
6309446 everything would be much simpler if they werent female and would logically make sense
6309447 indeed they are not just female but so annoyingly female
6309448 what you are still single oh poor guy you will one day progress and get a chick like us
6309449 i just got a new girlfriend and you are still single hah
6309450 we all are married or have girlfriends but you poor chap are still single
6309451 give the woman flowers chocolate poetry declarations of love your full attention your promises your exclusiveness your time your dreams your life and adopt her desires her plans her manipulations and her designs on your future
6309452 most guys still think like women they think that by sleeping with lots of women by having a girlfriend or by having a wife means they are successful with women
6309453 you mean that beggars cant be choosers you mean for guys to pick the girl rather than the other way around
6309454 youre closer and that is true but women date for all sorts of reasons they marry for all sorts of reasons they sleep with you for all sorts of reasons to the addition of the above you want to find a woman that is interested in you
6309455 oh poor thing you will get a girl like me one day
6309456 the error is guys defining their success on having a woman or women they should rather be concerned with having a woman that does actually like them
6309457 why do you say this pook it sounds like a bit more work
6309458 yes but if you do this then you wont be like the following
6309459 she said she loved me and we got married why does she want a divorce now
6309460 all my friends thought she was a keeper so why is she cheating on me with her ex
6309461 she wont return my repeated calls what is going on
6309462 i do her date ideas and she thought i was boring what does that mean
6309463 when you aim at something long term you need to make sure the woman like you just because she dates you sleeps with you and yes even marries you does not mean she likes you
6309464 you define what the dates are at first she will work with you if she likes you you can soften up later like in a couple of months if she starts breaking dates giving you the run around or seems inflexible then that should be warning signs that she doesnt like you
6309465 i see but what if youre so awful at djing that no woman likes you
6309466 then youll have more free time with your buddies success cannot be getting a girl because that means failure is being alone no failure is being in an unhappy marriage or a relationship where she has no true interest in you
6309467 so the focus must be on you including her interest
6309468 right drop the getting a girl is success mantra and you will never be dumped
6309469 what are you cruel voice your words like daggers in my heart
6309470 then you are not valiant for you fear the pointed tip like a soft worm i am you your inner self your own imagination and if you like soul by caging me your successes with women will spike with increasing frustration
6309471 what you are the one that is spreading this emptiness through my body like a virus
6309472 you craven dismal dreaming miscreant you know you are now getting what you desired women so why are you so unhappy
6309473 but i had to change because i wasnt getting the women
6309474 and you failed because by keeping me caged you limit yourself
6309475 indeed like a heaven over us the ladies in womaniverse watch us over yes they always notice you they look at your life and reward the men of the world with the feminine element
6309476 oh no some get virgin material while the fools get common ore
6309477 what else can you tell me of this feminine element
6309478 it is highly relaxing very ornamental in sports cars explodes and freezes for no reason and reacts well to gold platinum or any of the precious metals it also turns green when placed near superior specimens
6309479 what are you saying pook that how we are the rock in their world that they are the rock an element of ballast for us in this universe
6309480 oh silly youth these thoughts are too feathery and fluff at nothingness in your dimension dont think of it only read the letter
6309481 rarely usually women speak in so we men dont hear anything anyway but being a dutiful pook an emissary myself i have translated the letter to masculine terms
6309482 thank heavens now i see why its in 19th century style
6309483 look at me i am the object and axis of your world my whims become your laws what you enjoy today including your tastes in food women and cars will be dictated by me i alone will frame the world you live
6309484 because it was the truth why do you let people mold and shape your life your life is going in circles because you cannot tear yourself from your loser friends or stupid entertainment keep reading the letter
6309485 if one day you actually get the chance to enter womaniverse youll be even more amazed
6309486 is to unite your dream and day it is the only way
6309487 this is the most sexist thing i have ever heard
6309488 you doubtful youth you are a beanstalk cynic a crusty philosopher
6309489 look when we were young we all desired to grow up now once grown up we desire to be young again being poor you trade your time and health for money only to use that money for time and health we have all passed through the world of a child
6309490 are you saying that i ought to be child like
6309491 yes young kids lacking the chemical madness curse that puberty brings us are at perfect ease and treat the sexes appropriately no young boys will say whatever you want to do young boys run around they do not sit and talk to the girl all night young boys have their cars their trucks their dangers and excitements now compare the young boys actions to those who are really successful with women
6309492 they are identical i always thought women were immature for going after these so called jerks bad boys and jocks i see that in some ways they are immature but they kept that joy of youth with them whereas i had killed it
6309493 why i speak to her about philosophy about literature about the designs on the universe about dna about world events about
6309494 stop i can take no more come and drink from this fountain of youth
6309495 now all i want to do is do things and not talk i want to run around i want to have fun
6309496 and women go crazy over these types of guys some people are so scared of growing older that they become extremely aged in their youthful flesh now you will be the envy of every philosopher scholar thinker and deep analyzer you will be in the world they have no access to nothing has changed the attitude you had towards girls when you were in the sandbox is exactly the attitude you need now so think young and live
6309497 you are my life i love nothing else so well as you i will do anything for you
6309498 every guy has a passion about different things on that wall is his car passion we see many screens of different cars all ones he loves on that other wall there is his food passion we see screens of all his favorite foods and if you come along here youll find the ambition wall where screens show all the things he wants to do now look at the women wall
6309499 yes nature has designed us to love in a marriage way when there is only one picture on that wall
6309500 the problem is that he is not married or engaged to her so he is acting married to her when really they are dating or just friends
6309501 yes when a guy decides to go dating and dates only one chick at a time only one picture will appear on the wall when there is only one he is designed to think of her in a marriage way so he starts becoming afc with this girl he just talked to
6309502 so say if a guy is socially unskilled and has only one friend that is a girl only that girls picture will appear on the wall and because of that he will fall in love with his friend
6309503 exactly if there is only one f ckbuddy he will eventually want to date the girl want to become exclusive with her and turn into a total afc
6309504 then another girl is on the wall as well he cant act married if there is more than one girl up there thus he stops becoming a latent afc
6309505 but what if he has his interest in other things shouldnt he date only one girl then
6309506 no either go for many or go for none if you go for one you will become an afc most guys are too lazy or too scared to go for multiple girls so they remain afcs and forever remain in the vicious cycle
6309507 pook i recognize the young man you speak of it is you
6309508 alas ive only been telling you my own recollections with every lesson here when i condemn the young man i am only condemning myself let us continue
6309509 that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his little fist youre hooked for life
6309510 and i am so happy that youngsters have loved the movie
6309511 i firmly believe that i have not done any bad films they did not do well because of many reasons in some cases the films were not marketed properly also some good stories were not made properly and i did certain films because i could not say no
6309512 kareenas song is crucial to the story of billoo barber like kareenas famous song in don that people cannot forget people will never forget the billoo barber number too kareenas name will become synonymous with the number
6309513 i think 90 of the husbands are like that they believe women are meant to do household work jayaram chooses not to do any work when he is at home even if he wants a pen we will have to take it to him
6309514 one has to live life to its full if justice has to be done to ones passion for cinema thats why id like to take breaks and then get back to acting
6309515 do we want a man with ptsd to lead the free world

6309518 the story is extremely compelling sometimes laugh out loud outrageous and above all inspiring
6309519 indiepix has been exceedingly active and crafty in finding new ways to have important films seen by wide audiences they are absolutely artist friendly and it turns out that theyre good folks to boot
6309520 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members

6309522 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6309523 i work at home i can work whatever hours i want
6309524 we are not going to as individuals be able to erase evil from the world that is gods task

6309544 we are generally pleased however that the commission essentially has agreed with our final plan concerning additional wind and solar power and our plans to close two of our power plants

6309580 i really felt if we had stayed healthy we had a very good chance
6309581 in 05 when we got carlos delgado in there and the way we played earlier in the year i thought we had a chance but we had injuries in the bullpen
6309582 in those years we were in it until the last couple of weeks but it didnt work out
6309583 i really think if that team had stayed together it could have been something special but with no stadium deal i could understand what jeffrey had to do
6309584 they did a good job scouting guys and put a team in here that has a chance to win again
6309585 a couple of guys in here asked who was on the team in 05 and when i told them theyre like oh thats a good team
6309586 sometimes the best team doesnt win when you dont go the whole year with the same 25 guys it can be tough we just had too many injuries in the bullpen
6309587 i dont think many of the players know that fact
6309588 maybe i should post that at the door it could be really important to finish a month with a winning record
6309589 especially for the young players and their sense of confidence
6309590 were obviously not happy with the season but we can get productive results if you look at certain microcosms of the team
6309591 coming out on top with a winning record in august will prove that weve got a good team here for the future
6309592 with the amount of traffic that weve had come through this clubhouse you have to set small goals when the season doesnt go quite as you would have liked it to
6309593 so i think a first step is to have one winning month and then from there you could set another one like well lets be over 500 from this point on
6309594 you have to take small steps you cant just assume that youre going to go from being an under 500 club to being way over
6309595 you try to relay that to them in spring training
6309596 when you see the infield back hit the ball up the middle give up an at bat for an rbi thats what youve got to do im not worried about hitting the ball on the nose for a base hit
6309597 if the infield is in thats a different a story now i want to hit the ball into the outfield but if they are giving you a run im hitting the ball straight at the shortstop as long as i get it by that pitcher
6309598 we know amongst ourselves that we have to do better in those situations
6309599 i think were trying to maybe concentrate a little more in those situations
6309600 i had a guy on third and the infield is back all i have to do is hit a ground ball and weve got a run we know whats at stake we know all these ballgames are meaningful if we want to get to where we want to get we know we have to do those things
6309601 it started on tuesday afternoon with my chest and then the back and the rest of the body started aching
6309602 i had a fever and i think its because of the strong air conditioning system in the athletes village
6309603 i wasnt feeling good so i just tried to stay in position i didnt see the guy coming in on the inside and when i did i had to push it
6309604 i tried to stick to a good tactical race i kicked at the right time and thought i was done when i saw the guys coming at the end it was difficult so i hope the flu clears up before the semifinals
6309605 after shooting both men they then kidnapped the wife and took her to a nearby veld where she is believed to have been raped
6309606 my heart is so sore i lost my eldest son and it makes me angry the worst part is that he and his wife have a 7 year old girl who now has lost both parents in one night
6309607 i dont know what we are going to do i just hope the police catch whoever is responsible for this
6309608 i see petrol dropping around r1 per litre or even more
6309609 we have a lot of land transport here while the big cities in europe have waterways
6309610 if the drop in diesel prices is the beginning of a trend then this would become important for inflation it would delay second round inflation fears where prices are passed on
6309611 the winter buying season has begun and the hurricane season only ends in november

6309613 the right to dignity does not necessarily extend to the right not to be named as a suspect once there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed
6309614 that mr zuma is suspected of alleged corruption is the truth it does not signify his guilt his right to be presumed innocent remains untrammelled
6309615 but there is no right not to be named as a suspect
6309616 the applicant has admitted that he had conversations with two judges of the constitutional court about the zuma thint cases his attempt to portray these discussions as a collegial interchange is unsustainable
6309617 elementary principles of judicial ethics preclude a judge of one division to discuss the merits of a matter with judges of the highest court in circumstances where judgment is still pending
6309618 on his own version this is precisely what the applicant did that with respect amounts to gross misconduct
6309619 with a view to the constitutional values of openness and accountability it was considered that the independence of the constitutional court and its deliberative processes would be best protected by a public disclosure of what occurred
6309620 it was felt it was particularly important to reassure the public that the public judges of the court are committed to protecting the integrity of the judicial process and will not even when circumstances may be difficult or hostile shrink from that commitment
6309621 given the sensitivities that have developed around this matter a court would not like any party to be uncomfortable
6309622 let me make it quite clear that i do not crib or plagiarise from mr trengove
6309623 you would be tying the hands of the jsc if your lordships grant it the declaration
6309624 the good thing is that you dont have to dress up for it
6309625 im 60 years old have a ba in cultural anthropology from columbia university and ive been married for 25 years i have a son in his last year of college who lives at home hes a double major in english literature and religion men call me for an infinity of reasons but mostly for what i call executive stress relief its not sex its a cocktail of testosterone fuelled by addiction to pornography loneliness and the need to hear a womans voice i make twice the money i made in the corporate world i work from home the money transfers into my bank account daily im scheherazade if i dont tell stories that fascinate the pasha he will kill me in the morning
6309626 when i first started i was nervous but after a while i guess you could say the kinkier the sex talk the more i was like wow the phone is like my new toy lets just say i have found myself and my sexuality through this i find myself attracted to females just like im attracted to males so yeah you can say i play for both teams i really enjoy being a phone sex operator
6309627 ive only been a phone sex operator for a few months now to help with extra income im a single mother of two young boys so money is very important to me im in a loving relationship with a wonderful man who loves my kids and treats me very well he understands that im only doing this part time to help save for my childrens college fund
6309628 tuning into mens voices instead of getting caught up on their looks was the same as a person suddenly going blind only to find their other senses enhanced i learnt to listen to men in a deeper way my job behoved me to reach beyond the little mind games i think if all women did phone sex before they lost their virginity they would make much better choices
6309629 the most amusing part about the job was when my partner was in the room with me reading while i worked id try to avoid eye contact with her because id see her stifle a smirk or make a gagging gesture or look at me pantomiming utter shock and id start laughing uncontrollably
6309630 i never thought id work in phone sex all those years doing customer service people would comment on my sexy voice i thought i was being professional not sexy now customers leave with more than a smile

6309633 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6309634 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6309635 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6309636 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6309637 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6309638 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6309639 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those

6309652 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s it is different in that bolt has a bigger edge than owens in his finals
6309653 bolt in a way if he maintains that in the future will bring a mark like jesse owens
6309654 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made
6309655 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6309656 he is a young man bolt will learn that sooner or later he is a great athlete of course

6309664 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6309665 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6309666 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6309672 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6309673 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6309674 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go

6309696 regrouping 15 km within the security zone that russia itself set up around the perimeter of south ossetia
6309697 what russian forces are doing now in georgia has nothing to do with south ossetia
6309698 russias goal is geopolitical it is trying to establish control over central georgia to prevent the implementation of projects to transport hydrocarbons from the caspian basin through the south caucasus to europe which are already being implemented
6309699 whoever controls central georgia which all communications pass through controls all of georgia
6309700 whoever controls georgia controls all of the south caucasus and the caucasus as a whole whoever controls the caucasus controls all of the black sea caspian basin including central asia

6309708 im not gonna clothesline you or anything im just curious we saw you talking to the old guy and taking pictures and wondered what you were doing
6309709 nothing remains that looks like a plane its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you its the most like hell ive ever seen
6309710 its been very hard emergencies of this kind leave an enormous mark on you
6309711 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6309712 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6309713 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6309714 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances
6309715 i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broken and the aircraft was lying on its side
6309716 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burnt i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6309717 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt there was fire in the motor of the plane which crashed very shortly after take off

6309720 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end
6309721 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6309722 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6309723 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6309724 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6309725 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6309726 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6309727 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work

6309872 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6309873 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6309874 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6309875 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county

6309931 un proyecto de formaci n de capacidades e investigaci n aplicada sobre redes inal mbricas comunitarias para am rica latina y el caribe a trav s del cual se pretende que la aplicaci n de estas destrezas sirva para ampliar la conectividad a comunidades rurales y urbano marginales que no han podido aprovechar a n de los beneficios de las tecnolog as de la informaci n y la comunicaci n
6309932 la idea del proyecto es apoyar a aquellas organizaciones e iniciativas que tienen inter s en compartir recursos para bajar los costos de acceso a la infraestructura de comunicaciones la tecnolog a inal mbrica se plantea de bajo costo en donde quien cuenta con un acceso dedicado a internet puede compartir ese ancho de banda con otros que est n cerca o un poquito m s lejos utilizando ciertos equipos y con cierto conocimiento
6309933 la propuesta es tejer esas redes que no son de cables ni son de equipos sino es de gente que tiene conocimientos que quiere compartir con otros y tiene la necesidad de implementar estos proyectos
6309934 fue una experiencia riqu sima en t rminos de aprender sobre la resoluci n de problemas a la hora de hacer una instalaci n
6309935 si bien la instalaci n del enlace fue un xito no fue f cil integrarla con el taller en su aspecto de vivir la experiencia dado el tiempo que esto consumir a esta es una lecci n que debemos rescatar para proyectos futuros
6309936 creo que el estudio de sitio previo a la instalaci n es un aspecto que aport m s al taller en tanto proceso did ctico al resaltar los desaf os que significan la instalaci n en t rminos del escenario y la posibilidad de hacer una pr ctica de larga distancia en una situaci n similar
6309937 tuvimos la oportunidad de convivir por unos momentos con representantes de la comunidad beneficiada por el enlace instalado quienes dieron sus impresiones acerca de las oportunidades que el enlace les abre
6309938 la conexi n inal mbrica que se instal ser de gran ayuda para la comunidad
6309939 gracias al acceso a internet en la escuela la comunidad comenz a planear proyectos a futuro como alfabetizaci n digital a los adultos y j venes de la zona extensi n de la red a otras escuelas cercanas para poder compartir informaci n y crear actividades en conjunto fue muy grato ver la alegr a de la comunidad alumnos padres vecinos etc al ver que la escuela contaba con acceso a la red
6309940 particip en la elecci n de la sede la selecci n de participantes la instalaci n de la antena y en las sesiones te ricas
6309941 todos los participantes ten an en buena medida una preparaci n t cnica y una pr ctica social compartir el conocimiento de las redes inal mbricas con este grupo abre nuevas posibilidades de cobertura de redes en la regi n donde las grandes compa as no est n necesariamente interesadas en brindar servicios y las entidades reguladoras no hacen un trabajo suficiente para garantizar un acceso equitativo en todas las poblaciones
6309942 los participantes pudieron probar las antenas que construyeron a una distancia de 4 6 km y usando el enlace para transmitir voz y video
6309943 para laneta es esta una experiencia que necesariamente debe ser replicada a nivel nacional y regional m xico es un pa s diverso con muchas poblaciones marginadas en donde la puesta al alcance de las nuevas tecnolog as puede incidir en aspectos de mejoras econ micas y participaci n ciudadana
6309944 la experiencia fue muy buena como en los otros talleres los participantes proven an del sector t cnico y estaban involucrados en proyectos sociales de uso de las tics
6309945 el m dulo de pr ctica de enlaces de larga distancia y de sistemas de energ a se hicieron en la escuela hubo un momento de compartir con los alumnos y maestros de la escuela que creo que fue muy importante tanto para los locales como para el curso
6309946 eso afianz mucho al grupo de los instructores y mejor la din mica de trabajo
6309947 fueron muy buenos seg n las evaluaciones de los participantes quienes quedaron no solo conformes con la capacitaci n sino muy motivados para llevar a cabo realizaciones pr cticas en sus lugares
6309948 se han ido evaluando distintos aspectos del proceso a lo largo del camino
6309949 en lo personal creo que el proceso ha sido positivo y muy alentador para el futuro sobre todo por las relaciones que se han logrado establecer entre las instituciones de latinoam rica que han participado
6309950 de hecho el borrador de una segunda fase ya se ha sometido a consideraci n de algunos donantes y se est n buscando otros esta segunda fase no solo comprende talleres de capacitaci n sino tambi n un seguimiento y ayuda a los participantes en sus proyectos y apoyo a la realizaci n de talleres nacionales
6309951 para nodo tau el proyecto signific entrar de lleno con una tecnolog a con la que est bamos apenas comenzando a trabajar y tomar contacto con proyectos similares en toda am rica latina ha consolidado por otra parte el saber t cnico de algunos de nosotros y nos ha posicionado institucionalmente en este tema
6309952 la experiencia fue muy grata se not en las evaluaciones finales que los participantes quedaron muy conformes
6309953 la mayor a de los participantes son miembros de organizaciones muy activas en trabajos sociales si bien el nivel t cnico no era el mismo en la mayor a de los participantes fue impresionante ver el compromiso y los esfuerzos que hicieron para poder aprender cada detalle de los temas y llegar con una excelente base a sus lugares para poder seguir profundizando todos los conocimientos y la informaci n adquirida
6309954 los resultados fueron excelentes gracias a la experiencia y nivel t cnico de los instructores y a la predisposici n y las ganas de aprender de los participantes se pudieron dictar todos los temas y crear muchas expectativas de nuevas soluciones para sus proyectos creo que para nodo tau es esta una experiencia muy grata que nos posiciona como una organizaci n pionera en el tema de conectividad y acceso a internet me siento muy conforme de la visi n institucional que se gener alrededor del nodo gracias a su participaci n como miembro organizador e instructor del proyecto
6309955 para ello cuenta con un espacio que se propone revisar la
6309956 se realiz una breve introducci n en la que hablamos sobre los derechos en internet y conceptos b sicos sobre comunicaci n con el apoyo de los y las participantes se identificaron palabras relacionadas con proyectos de desarrollo que involucran tecnolog as con ello se procur evidenciar que los proyectos de tics no solo est n asociados a las tecnolog as implementadas sino a su incidencia en las comunidades
6309957 por su energ a sensibilidad y humor el taller fue extenso accesible y claro
6309958 hubo compa eras que expresaron abiertamente lo dif cil que es el campo de las tics para las mujeres sobre todo en las aulas esto tiene que ver con que algunas de las integrantes participan de proyectos que espec ficamente se enfocan a las mujeres productivos por ejemplo
6309959 en las sesiones t cnicas las mujeres expresaron preguntas una o dos veces m ximo mientras los hombres frecuentemente los mismos expresaron hasta diez es evidente la diferencia en la participaci n en plenarias aunque se debe tener en cuenta que eran menos tambi n
6309960 se habl del tema de g nero y se abri espacio para que los y las participantes representaran escenas en la que se consideraran los roles de g nero
6309961 las dramatizaciones fueron todo un xito pero tomaron m s tiempo de lo planeado eso impidi que se trabajara en profundidad otro aspecto como es el la violencia hacia las mujeres y las tics
6309962 hay que ser muy muy pr cticas orientando a la pregunta qu hago en mi proyecto para identificar y enfrentar desaf os de g nero creo que si logramos interconectar el tema de g nero con la realidad cotidiana y con ideas para el cambio el trabajo ser m s relevante para los integrantes
6309963 overall usk and prescoed remained good prisons focusing on their different and important roles
6309964 however this inspection revealed a degree of complacency and some drift which needs swiftly to be remedied if the prisons are to regain and retain their high performing status
6309965 the underpinning quality of staff prisoner relationships is also very good and the chief inspector confirms this
6309966 the report will act as a spur to the governor and staff to continue to build on a high quality performance
6309967 already the clustering of forensic psychological resources across two welsh prisons and an additional lead role for resettlement at usk are bringing improvements to performance
