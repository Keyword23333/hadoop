910052 the restaurants owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes after several months of analysis they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour if our personnel are better prepared we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man hours per shift
910053 ill get another spoon next time i go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now
910054 excuse me but can you tell me why you have that string right there
910055 after you get it out how do you put it back
910056 i dont know about the others but i use the spoon
910057 well you just have to go out in the street to realize that god doesnt exist tell me if god exists would there be so many sick people would there be abandoned children if god existed there would be neither suffering nor pain i cant imagine a loving a god who would allow all of these things

910098 die kommission gelangte zu dem schluss dass die betreffende investition mit den zielen des euratom vertrags in einklang steht sofern die empfehlungen der kommission umgesetzt werden
910099 die vom investor vorgeschlagenen reaktoren vom typ wwer 440 v213 besitzen keine volldruck containment struktur wie sie bei der neuesten auslegung von kernkraftwerken die in europa geplant oder im bau sind verwendet wird

910101 verbieten sie den anbau des gen mais mon810 herr minister
910102 wenn wir die sicherheit der anlage in frage stellen hei t es mochovce sei praktisch ein neubau da so viele nachbesserungen an der urspr nglichen konzeption vorgenommen werden wenn wir jedoch eine nach heutigem recht vorgeschriebene umweltpr fung fordern beruft man sich auf eine baugenehmigung die zur zeiten des eisernen vorhangs erteilt wurde
910103 mochovce 3 und 4 ist eines der gef hrlichsten akw die derzeit in der eu geplant werden
910104 moderne reaktoren werden inzwischen mit einem doppelwandigen sicherheitsbeh lter gebaut
910105 es w re eine schande wenn ein solches projekt im jahr 2008 innerhalb der eu realisiert w rde mochovce ist nicht nur f r die menschen in der slowakei sondern auch f r die nachbarl nder eine gro e gefahr
910106 wenn sie das nicht machen laufen die alten kohlekraftwerke weiter und produzieren mehr co2 als heute
910107 die versorgungssicherheit bis 2020 ist wegen des verzichts auf die atomkraftnutzung nicht in gefahr um das klimaschutzziel zu erreichen bis 2020 die treibhausgasemissionen um 40 prozent gegen ber 1990 zu senken schlagen wir f r den kraftwerkspark eine begrenzung der emissionen auf 225 millionen tonnen co2 im jahr 2020 vor
910108 die spd steht f r eine starke bahn die zuallererst den menschen verpflichtet ist darauf k nnen sie sich verlassen
910109 durch einen tarifvertrag sichergestellt dass der privatisierungs anteil von 24 9 prozent nicht erh ht werden kann
910110 das gesamte konsortium f r seine dienste beim b rsengang auf eine bezahlung hoffen die etwa 1 5 bis 1 75 prozent des emissionsvolumens entspricht im september und oktober solle dann die bahn aktie interessenten vorgestellt werden ende oktober sei preisfestlegung und zuteilung anvisiert
910111 einem m glichen missbrauch durch die deutsche bahn ag t r und tor
910112 die begrenzung privater beteiligung auf 24 9 prozent in koalitionsgespr chen nicht verhandelbar ist
910113 setzen sie sich f r die r ckkehr von gazale salame ein
910114 lediglich 28 prozent bevorzugen eine privatisierungsvariante f r einen verkauf der schienenverkehrst chter wie mit dem holding modell vorgesehen sprechen sich dabei elf prozent aus zw lf prozent sind f r den verkauf von anteilen an der gesamten db ag
910115 f r ein viertel der spd anh nger ist die haltung der parteien zur bahnprivatisierung sehr wichtig oder wichtig f r die wahlentscheidung zur n chsten bundestagswahl dieser wert ist bei spd anh ngern doppelt so hoch wie bei der gesamtbev lkerung
910116 wir m ssen die diskussion jetzt vom kopf auf die f e stellen wir m ssen deutlich machen wof r wir privates geld ben tigen dann k nnen wir kritiker berzeugen
910117 um engp sse auszur umen um mehr in l rmschutz zu investieren um bahnh fe zu renovieren
910118 diese debatte werde ich nicht ffentlich f hren dazu haben wir eine arbeitsgruppe in der spd die solche fragen diskutieren wird
910119 mehdorn steinbr ck und tiefensee wollen uns mit dem holdingmodell ein faules ei ins nest legen

910124 dar ber kann man im h rsaal spannend diskutieren aber das verfassungsgericht ist kein h rsaal es ist keine experimentierstube es ist daf r da die verfassung zu bewahren nicht daf r sie aus intellektueller lust und rechtstheoretischem vergn gen einzureissen
910125 in diesen konstellationen d rfte der rechtsgedanke der rechtfertigenden pflichtenkollision nicht von vornherein auszuschlie en sein
910126 die w rde des opfers oder die des t ters zu verletzen
910127 wenn man das hohe seismische risiko der bauregion und den niedrigen atomsicherheitslevel in bulgarien zusammenrechnet kann man nur zu einem schluss kommen dieses projekt muss sofort gestoppt werden
910128 die am freitag ver ffentlichte stellungnahme der kommission zeigt dass die kommission weder auf die stimme der vernunft noch der b rger h rt wenn es um atomenergie geht
910129 die kommission hat sich bewusst entschieden die erdbebenrisiken zu ignorieren und umweltfragen aus ihrer stellungnahme zu belene auszuklammern mit dieser verfahrensweise will energie kommissar piebalgs offenbar sicherstellen dass auch die schlimmsten atomprojekte gr nes licht erhalten k nnen
910130 hier kommt eine grundsatzentscheidung auf uns zu denn euratom hat seit ber 20 jahren kein geld mehr f r den bau neuer reaktoren gegeben und belene w re der erste russische reaktor der innerhalb der eu gebaut w rde
910131 wir sind entschlossen zu verhindern dass ffentliche gelder in projekte wie belene und mochovce fliessen die die gesundheit und sicherheit von millionen menschen bedrohen
910132 belene ist von privatbanken abgelehnt worden und es w re ein skandal wenn es nun mit ffentlichen geldern gebaut w rde
910133 projekte wie belene und mohovce zu unterst tzen ist wie russisches roulette spielen sie erh hen die gefahr eines atomunfalls in europa und die bev lkerung lehnt sie ab in den letzten zwei wochen haben etwa 30 000 b rger an kommissar piebalgs geschrieben und dies ist erst der beginn einer breiteren kampagne
910134 die kommission muss aufh ren als atomlobbyist aufzutreten und atomsicherheitsfragen endlich ernst nehmen
910135 die erde ist uns von gott anvertraut als haushalterin und haushalter dass wir hierzu heute die kr fte b ndeln ist ein wichtiger schritt wir brauchen klare und verbindliche politische rahmenbedingungen f r die wirtschaft heute geht eine mahnung an die politik mehr und schnelleres handeln ist notwendig die bundesregierung nimmt noch zu oft r cksicht auf wenige gro e unternehmen die die n tigen weichenstellungen verhindern wollen
910136 m chtegern klima kanzlerin merkel sowie auto und kohleminister gabriel m ssen wissen die kuschel zeit ist vorbei die klimapolitische ein ugigkeit zugunsten von auto airline und energiekonzernen werden wir nicht mehr hinnehmen wir wissen mit jedem unwetter und hitze sommer jeder d rre und hungersnot in den l ndern des s dens wird die klimabewegung wachsen
910137 drohen sie auto kommissar g nter verheugen mit der rute
910138 an die 30 000 mails sind innerhalb von nur drei tagen beim bundestag eingegangen in denen b rgerinnen und b rger sich dar ber beschweren dass diese debatte zum gentechnikgesetz zu nachtschlafender zeit stattfindet das zeigt uns wie interessiert die menschen die entwicklung des gentechnikrechts verfolgen und sollte uns gemahnen sensibel mit dem thema umzugehen und f r vertrauen zu sorgen indem wir f r rechtliche rahmenbedingungen eintreten die durchgehend dem vorsorgeprinzip gerecht werden
910139 dies ndert aber nichts an der bedeutung dieses themas f r die abgeordneten des deutschen bundestages in dieser woche werden keine abschlie enden entscheidungen zum vierten gesetz zur nderung des gentechnikgesetzes getroffen so dass die sorgen und bef rchtungen von ihnen selbstverst ndlich ber cksichtigt werden und ffentlichkeit und medien in den n chsten wochen ausreichend zugang zur debatte haben werden
910140 eine privatisierungs einigung auf basis des volksaktien modells der spd nicht m glich sei und deshalb die weitere zukunft der db ag politisch neu nach der n chsten bundestagswahl gekl rt werden m sse
910141 es stellt sich die frage wie die mit dem zugriff auf informationstechnische systeme verbundenen gef hrdungen angemessen erfasst und bew ltigt werden k nnen
910142 es ist schon sehr unbefriedigend dass es einer kleinen anfrage bedarf bis man alle informationen zu einem solch wichtigen thema bekommt hier wird mit nebelkerzen gearbeitet
910143 bei der privatisierung der bahn geht es also schlicht und einfach um eine beraubung oder enteignung der bev lkerung
910144 ich sehe nicht dass eine teilprivatisierung fr her als ende 2008 vollzogen werden kann
910145 mit hochgeschwindigkeit aufs falsche gleis bahnprivatisierung in deutschland und international
910146 es kommt zur zerschlagung einheitlicher bahnen zur halbierung der belegschaften zu einem abbau in der fl che und dennoch gleichzeitig zu gr eren finanziellen belastungen f r die ffentliche hand
910147 mit dem recht auf informationelle selbstbestimmung w re eine gesellschaftsordnung nicht vereinbar in der b rger nicht mehr wissen k nnen wer was wann und bei welcher gelegenheit ber sie wei
910148 der versuch die verfassungsrechtlichen und wirtschaftlichen zielsetzungen in einklang zu bringen kommt einer quadratur des kreises gleich
910149 wir werden eine faire l sung finden die die lasten der hersteller gerecht verteilt
910150 183 gleich 13 das geht gegen den gesunden menschenverstand verkehrsminister wolfgang tiefensee spd fraktionsvorsitzender peter struck und unions fraktionschef volker kauder k nnen offenbar nicht rechnen
910151 laut amtlicher statistik hat die deutsche bahn ag heute ein verm gen von 183 milliarden euro davon soll die h lfte verkauft werden doch mehr als 6 5 milliarden euro kommen daf r nicht rein
910152 so kommt die l gengleichung 183 13 heraus das ist die formel f r verschleuderung von ffentlichem eigentum
910153 zus tzlich soll der bund weiter j hrlich um die acht milliarden euro f r den bahnverkehr bereit stellen aber seinen einfluss weitgehend einb en
910154 auch mit dem volksaktien modell wird die h lfte des bahnverm gens zum schleuderpreis verkauft
910155 allerdings werden dann auch die k ufer betrogen denn die bahn als ffentliches unternehmen geh rt l ngst allen b rgerinnen und b rgern
910156 das hei t dass wir auf keinen fall vor dem spd parteitag eine endg ltige entscheidung im bundestag f llen werden
910157 wenn der spd parteitag ende oktober ein anderes konzept beschlie t wird sich die koalition dem kaum widersetzen k nnen
910158 ich erwarte dass eine endg ltige verabschiedung der bahnreform erst nach dem bundesparteitag erfolgt
910159 es muss deutliche nachbesserungen geben sonst sehe ich im bundesrat f r diesen gesetzentwurf keine mehrheit
910160 echtes mitsprache und kontrollrecht der l nder bei der verwendung der f r investitionen im nahverkehrsbereich vorgesehenen bundesmittel

910163 das ist in wirklichkeit ein weiteres element zur unkontrollierten gentechnikausbreitung

910166 das volk hat anspruch darauf zu wissen von wem und in welcher gr enordnung seine vertreter geld oder geldwerte leistungen entgegennehmen das interesse des abgeordneten informationen aus der sph re beruflicher t tigkeiten vertraulich behandelt zu sehen ist gegen ber dem ffentlichen interesse an der erkennbarkeit m glicher interessenverkn pfungen der mitglieder des deutschen bundestages grunds tzlich nachrangig
910167 zu den pflichten eines abgeordneten geh rt es dass er in einer weise und einem umfang an den parlamentarischen aufgaben teilnimmt die deren erf llung gew hrleistet

910175 wirksame trennung der versorgung und erzeugung vom betrieb der netze entflechtung
910176 das ziel der im eckpunktepapier geforderten ma nahmen ist lediglich kontamination unter dem kennzeichnungs schwellenwert von 0 9 zu halten
910177 jedem bei dem nicht tatsachen die vermutung begr nden dass die informationen der erleichterung einer feldzerst rung dienen sollen auskunft ber das grundst ck mit anbau von gentechnisch ver nderten pflanzen erteilt werden
910178 spezifische bereich der wahrnehmung parlamentarischer angelegenheiten bleibt vom informationszugang ausgeschlossen
910179 die bundesregierung sei nicht dagegen den aussto von co2 auf 120 gramm pro kilometer zu begrenzen
910180 es geht hier nicht um gro e oder kleine autos sondern um die frage wie sich die hersteller auf dem markt behaupten k nnen ich lasse keinen zweifel daran dass wir von den herstellern gro er autos st rkere anstrengungen erwarten und die k nnen das auch leisten
910181 der von ihnen zitierte grenzwert von 0 9 kann nicht gegenstand der novellierung des gentechnikgesetzes sein da er im november 2002 von den eu landwirtschaftsministern beschlossen wurde die damals zust ndige ministerin k nast hatte diesem wert zugestimmt
910182 die spd hat sich in sachen kernenergie in eine bestimmte richtung entschieden und ich rechne auch nicht damit dass sie diese entscheidung in naher zukunft revidiert deshalb n tzt es nichts wenn man jeden morgen einmal dar ber spricht
910183 man muss der stromwirtschaft immer wieder sagen sie hat damals wenn auch nicht ganz freiwillig den atomausstieg unterschrieben und mit den unterschriften und den daraus folgenden ma nahmen im atomgesetz m ssen jetzt alle beteiligten leben
910184 es ist nicht so dass die kyoto ziele eins zu eins von der kernenergie abh ngig sind und dass man automatisch alle kyoto ziele verpasst wenn man die kernenergie reduziert aber nat rlich muss man wenn man aus der kernenergie aussteigt an anderer stelle mehr co2 mindern es gibt in der eu viele staaten die keine kernenergie brauchen um die kyoto ziele zu erreichen
910185 deshalb muss man energie sparen deshalb muss man auf erneuerbare energien setzen und deshalb muss man sich nat rlich auch berlegen was f r folgen hat es wenn wir kernkraftwerke abschalten
910186 wir wissen dass 80 prozent der verbraucherinnen und verbraucher den einsatz von gvo in lebensmitteln ablehnen wir wollen dass sie sich auch weiterhin frei entscheiden k nnen sollen ob sie lebensmittel mit gentechnisch ver nderten organismen haben wollen oder nicht wir wollen auch dass die land und ern hrungswirtschaft diese produkte auch weiterhin anbauen und vermarkten kann und es sichergestellt bleibt dass es keine schleichende verunreinigung der umwelt und der gentechnikfreien produktion gibt der von bundesminister seehofer erarbeitete entwurf von eckpunkten f r eine novelle des gentechnikrechts gen gt diesen anforderungen nicht
910187 die weiteren verhandlungen mit der union im kommenden jahr werden deshalb nicht einfach werden
910188 auch wenn unicredit hvb und ba ca bislang noch keinen offiziellen grundsatz sich nicht an der finanzierung von kernenergieprojekten zu beteiligen beschlossen haben so sind wir uns dennoch der bedeutung von bankdienstleistungen f r eine nachhaltige entwicklung sehr bewusst
910189 jedem der gro en energieversorger die wie enbw einen gro teil ihres stroms aus kernkraft beziehen
910190 vielleicht sogar die h lfte der nachweisbaren gewinne durch l ngere laufzeit f r ffentliche zwecke bereitstellen
910191 die fraktion die linke lehnt die von der bundesregierung geplante aufweichung des gentechnikgesetzes ab und teilt ihre kritik an der geplanten novellierung
910192 vielen dank f r ihre email vom 15 september 2006 zur gentechnikfreien landwirtschaft vorab m chte ich anmerken dass mich zu diesem thema sehr viele besorgte anfragen aus meinem wahlkreis erreicht haben aus diesem grunde habe ich mich mit dieser thematik besonders eingehend befasst und mich insbesondere auch mit meinen fraktionskollegen und kolleginnen besprochen um der fragestellung umfassend gerecht zu werden all dies war sehr zeitintensiv so dass ich ihnen meine position zu diesem h chst problematischen thema in abstimmung mit den hinzugezogenen fraktionskollegen und kolleginnen erst heute darlegen kann und dies im folgenden gerne tue
910193 sehr geehrte damen und herren im zusammenhang mit der tierschutz nutztierhaltungsverordnung hatten sie mich angeschrieben und f r eine artgerechte haltung von legehennen pl diert wie sie wissen hat sich der bundesrat im fr hjahr dieses jahres gegen die stimmen von rheinland pfalz mehrheitlich f r ge nderte vorgaben f r die legehennenhaltung ausgesprochen und das bundeskabinett hat am 10 mai 2006 den von bundeslandwirtschafts minister seehofer vorgestellten nderungen der verordnung zugestimmt nach sorgf ltiger rechtlicher pr fung ist die rheinland pf lzische landes regierung zu dem ergebnis gelangt dass die derart ge nderte tierschutz nutztierhaltungs verordnung soweit sie die legehennenhaltung betrifft verfassungswidrig ist aus diesem grund wird die landesregierung wie bereits ffentlich dargestellt einen normenkontrollantrag beim bundes verfassungsgericht einreichen so soll verhindert werden dass bis ende 2020 gegen das tierschutzgesetz versto en wird und dass diejenigen gefl gelhalter bestraft werden die sich auf das urspr nglich f r ende 2006 vorgesehene verbot der k fighaltung eingestellt und entsprechend investiert haben mit freundlichen gr en gez kurt beck
910194 du kriegst meinen m hdrescher wenn ich auf mindestabstand verzichte
910195 teilnehmende vorst nde und f hrungskr fte von unternehmen k nnen erwarten entscheidungstr ger zu treffen und sich mit anderen wirtschaftsakteuren zu vernetzen
910196 die branche trifft sich mit den sterreichischen und finnischen eu ratspr sidentschaften in helsinki um die biotechnologie themen zu diskutieren die in den kommenden 6 monaten auf der europ ischen agenda stehen sollen
910197 die weitere novellierung des gentechnikrechts ist gegenstand eines eckpunktepapiers das derzeit innerhalb der bundesregierung vorbereitet wird sobald das eckpunktepapier abgeschlossen ist wird es der ffentlichkeit vorgestellt auf dieser grundlage soll anschlie end das gentechnikrecht ge ndert werden
910198 aktuelle berichte ber die firmenpolitik v a us amerikanischer saatguthersteller haben mich sehr nachdenklich gemacht wir wissen noch viel zu wenig ber die folgen der gentechnischen modifikationen an nutzpflanzen um abschlie ende urteile zur sicherheit abgeben zu k nnen
910199 frau granold wir sind stolz auf sie dieses land braucht parlamentarier und parlamentarierinnen wie sie abgeordnete die den mut haben sich ber fraktionsgr ben hinwegzusetzen und bei wichtigen themen eine eigene meinung zu vertreten dazu geh rt nicht nur in ihrer fraktion eine menge mut
910200 an der finanzierung des kernkraftwerkes belene werden wir uns nicht beteiligen
910201 ich glaube nicht dass sanktionen die l sung zu allen problemen sind
910202 man hat vier mehr oder weniger von einander unabh ngige sicherheitssysteme und in diesem fall sind zwei aus dem gleichen grund nicht angesprungen das ist in dieser branche eine sehr ernste angelegenheit es gab einen ausl ser der mehrere sicherheitssysteme au er kraft gesetzt hat
910203 die behauptung der betreiber ein st rfall wie in schweden sei in deutschen reaktoren nicht m glich ist definitiv falsch
910204 m glicherweise w rde er im detail anders ablaufen als in forsmark aber auf kritische st rfall situationen ist der brunsb ttel reaktor erkennbar schlechter vorbereitet als der in forsmark
910205 hunger ist ein gesellschaftliches und politisches problem das sich nicht durch den einsatz einer technik l sen l sst eine l sung des welthungerproblems kann nur durch eine vielzahl kleinteiliger dezentral wirkender und nachhaltig organisierter ma nahmen gelingen durch die bek mpfung von armut und misswirtschaft die beendigung kriegerischer auseinandersetzungen sowie den zugang zu land saatgut wasser und zu einheimischen m rkten ein wichtiger schl ssel liegt in einer gerechten welthandelsstruktur d h im abbau von ungerechtfertigten handelsbarrieren f r die entwicklungsl nder und der absenkung der in den industriel ndern immer weiter ausufernden agrarsubventionen auch die z chterische weiterentwicklung lokal angepasster pflanzensorten und die nutzung indigenen wissens k nnen helfen den welthunger zu bek mpfen gerade solche strategien aber rechnen sich f r internationale saatgutkonzerne nicht und werden daher vernachl ssigt die agro gentechnik taugt dagegen nicht den heutigen und zuk nftigen welthunger zu bek mpfen bei ihr handelt es sich um eine technologie die wenn berhaupt bestimmten bauern in den industrienationen kurzfristige vorteile sichern kann die gesamtgesellschaftlich aber teuer erkauft sind verlust an biodiversit t landschaftliche verarmung durch monokulturen langfristig erh hter bedarf an herbiziden und pestiziden die oligopolen markstrukturen im bereich der agro gentechnik wo nur ein halbes dutzend marktteilnehmer aktiv sind und der us amerikanische konzern monsanto ann hernd 90 prozent des marktes kontrolliert sorgen daf r dass diese technologie einseitig dem shareholder value von aktienbesitzern der beteiligten unternehmen nutzt bauern in den entwicklungsl ndern haben davon gar nichts
910206 ob in den atomkraftwerken in ihrem zust ndigkeitsbereich die notstromsysteme oder komponenten der notstromsysteme von aeg geliefert wurden die in schweden m glicherweise ursache der gravierenden auswirkungen des kurzschlusses waren
910207 es gen gt schon ein unwetter ein blitzschlag sturm ein durch schneelasten umfallender strommast oder auch ein sabotageakt dass es zum kurzschluss und infolge dessen in den deutschen atomkraftwerken zu gef hrlichen situationen kommen kann
910208 laut grs gesellschaft f r reaktorsicherheit ist diese problematik technisch nicht ausreichend verstanden und ein zuverl ssiger schutz ist schlichtweg nicht m glich
910209 herausgehobene stellungen die man ber viele jahre machen will vertragen sich auf dauer nach meiner pers nlichen einsch tzung nicht mit einem bundestagsmandat
910210 ich war bislang nicht ein einziges mal in einem interessenkonflikt weil ich jeweils nach meiner berzeugung und dem was ich den w hlern versprochen habe entscheide
910211 jemand dar ber beklagt da ich meine pflichten nicht erf lle
910212 sicherheit darf niemals f r kurzfristige konomische vorteile aufs spiel gesetzt werden
910213 es ist zeit der bulgarischen bev lkerung klarzumachen dass es nicht m glich ist in belene einen billigen und sicheren atomreaktor zu bauen
910214 gr ne gentechnik durch innovation zu mehr wohlstand und arbeitspl tzen
910215 gro britannien bekennt sich voll und ganz dazu die problematik im zusammenhang mit dem iranischen nuklearprogramm auf diplomatischem wege beizulegen
910216 dass niemand die absicht hat den weg eines milit rischen eingreifens zu gehen
910217 selbst der gentech konzern monsanto schreibt gen bauern den doppelten abstand zu bio bauern vertraglich vor
910218 in etwa so ausfallen wie auf der hauptversammlung der commerzbank
910219 sustainability als leitbild wird von internationalen b rsen honoriert und wirkt sich positiv auf den aktienkurs aus
910220 z b beim einsatz neuer technologien bei der nutzung von f rdermitteln f r umweltinvestitionen und auch beim management betrieblicher umweltrisiken
910221 aus vertraulichkeitsgr nden keine n heren ausk nfte zu konkreten kundenbeziehungen und gesch ften geben
910222 herr s der vertritt hier nicht die haltung der union im bundestag
910223 eine novelle brauchen wir aber sie muss sensibel mit den erwartungen der verbraucher umgehen aus dem sch pfungsgedanken heraus aber auch aus sicherheitsgr nden
910224 jede diesbez gliche kreditanfrage wird von uns sehr genau gepr ft und nur dann in erw gung gezogen wenn alle nationalen und internationalen umweltgesetze und vereinbarungen in diesem bereich eingehalten werden
910225 bei steigenden steuereinnahmen an der erh hung der mehrwertsteuer festhalten zu wollen ist der schlichte wahnsinn
910226 die politik tut gut daran nicht mit dem kopf durch die wand zu wollen
910227 die fremde erbsubstanz verbreite sich mit einer wahrscheinlichkeit von 1
910228 wir versichern auch kein grundst ck gegen hochwasser das im wasser liegt
910229 eine schnelle notabschaltung wie sie etwa n tig ist wenn ein gro er k hlmittel verlustes auftritt w re nicht m glich gewesen das h tte sehr kritisch werden k nnen ein super gau w re dann nicht mehr auszuschlie en gewesen
910230 ich kann keine interessenkollision erkennen und das unternehmen offenkundig auch nicht
910231 ich halte es f r erforderlich dass wir uns die zeit nehmen einige unklarheiten und m glicherweise unangemessene anforderungen der neuen verhaltensregeln einer weiteren beratung zu unterziehen
910232 die kleingruppenhaltung als gleichwertige alternative zur boden und freilandhaltung in deutschland eingef hrt werden
910233 gro betrieben muss um ein abwandern der legehennenhaltung in staaten mit geringeren tierschutzstandards m glichst zu verhindern die chance einger umt werden gegen ber der legehennenhaltung in anderen eu mitgliedstaaten wettbewerbsf hig zu sein
910234 die bestehenden kernkraftwerke sollten so lange betrieben werden d rfen wie ihr betrieb den sicherheitskriterien entspricht und genehmigungsf hig ist kernforschung ist fortzusetzen
910235 das einsperren des gefl gels in kleink figen auf der fl che eines din a4 blattes ist tierqu lerei die wir nicht unterst tzen werden auch die so genannten ausgestalteten k fige lehnen wir ab weil diese den legehennen kein artgerechtes verhalten erm glichen
910236 doch bundestagspr sident norbert lammert cdu will die ver ffentlichungspflicht jetzt auf die lange bank schieben
910237 die klage hat juristisch keine aufschiebende wirkung sie dient lammert lediglich als willkommener vorwand um die ihm ungenehme ver ffentlichungspflicht auszusitzen
910238 wir fragen herrn lammert warum decken sie die lobbyisten und dunkelm nner im parlament
910239 den letzten angriff auf die versch rften verhaltensregeln des bundestages konnten wir im letzten dezember abwehren als lammert sich weigerte deren ausf hrungsbestimmungen zu erlassen
910240 doch bundestagspr sident norbert lammert cdu will die ver ffentlichungspflicht jetzt auf die lange bank schieben
910241 zugleich zeichnet sich ab dass das gericht eine z gige verfahren anstrebt daher beabsichtige ich die ver ffentlichung bis zum vorliegen der entscheidung auszusetzen
910242 die klage hat juristisch keine aufschiebende wirkung sie dient lammert lediglich als willkommener vorwand um die ihm ungenehme ver ffentlichungspflicht auszusitzen
910243 abgesehen von dem erlass neuer ausf hrungsbestimmungen halte ich es allerdings f r erforderlich dass wir uns die zeit nehmen einige unklarheiten und m glicherweise unangemessene anforderungen der neuen verhaltensregeln einer weiteren beratung zu unterziehen inhaltlich bezieht sich meine sorge insbesondere auf die regelung wonach eink nfte aus einer in der zeit der mitgliedschaft weitergef hrten berufst tigkeit umfassend und unter angabe der jeweiligen herkunft angezeigt und in der beschriebenen form auch ver ffentlicht werden m ssen diese vorgabe bewirkt nach meiner auffassung f r freiberufler selbst ndige unternehmer und landwirte zun chst einen er rterungsw rdigen aufwand dar ber hinaus stellen sich ernste fragen des grundrechtsschutzes im hinblick auf die abgeordneten beziehungsweise deren kunden klienten mitgesellschafter und andere vertragspartner
910244 wir fragen herrn lammert warum decken sie die lobbyisten und dunkelm nner im parlament
910245 den letzten angriff auf die versch rften verhaltensregeln des bundestages konnten wir im letzten dezember abwehren als lammert sich weigerte deren ausf hrungsbestimmungen zu erlassen
910246 deshalb gebe ich zu erw gen zum beispiel im wege eines bundestagbeschlusses eine aussetzung der regelung bis zum abschluss aller notwendigen vorbereitenden arbeiten zu veranlassen abgesehen von dem erlass neuer ausf hrungsbestimmungen halte ich es allerdings f r erforderlich dass wir uns die zeit nehmen einige unklarheiten und m glicherweise unangemessene anforderungen der neuen verhaltensregeln einer weiteren beratung zu unterziehen
910247 sollte eine deutliche minderung des stromverbrauchs angestrebt werden w rde dies nach berzeugung der landesregierung zu dramatischen wohlstandseinbu en f hren
910248 die union wird ihrem anspruch politik auf der grundlage des christlichen menschenbildes zu machen nur dann gerecht wenn sie umgehend den ausstieg aus der atomaren sackgasse erm glicht
910249 ich habe f r dieses vorgehen keinerlei verst ndnis der zeitpunkt der ver ffentlichung der angaben steht nicht im ermessen des bundestagspr sidenten vielmehr sind sie an geltendes recht und gesetz gebunden in diesem fall an die geltende fassung des abgeordnetengesetztes und die gesch ftsordnung des bundestags
910250 wichtige fragen im zusammenhang mit einer zukunftsf higen und nachhaltigen energieversorgung sollten nicht auf basis einer fiktion er rtert werden
910251 ein kernschmelzunfall ist daher zwar nicht unm glich jedoch so unwahrscheinlich dass sich dies menschlichem vorstellungsverm gen entzieht
910252 wenn die politik sich ganz und gar dem wunsch der bev lkerung widersetzt werden auch die menschen wieder auf die barrikaden gehen im ernstfall wehren sich die menschen so wie es gerade in frankreich passiert
910253 dass viele viele menschen die schon in den 80er jahren gegen atomkraft aktiv waren sich heute wieder engagieren und es gibt anzeichen dass die heranwachsende jugendgeneration wieder weit politischer wird als die der letzten jahre
910254 44a des abgeordnetengesetzes sowie die verhaltensregeln f r bundestagsabgeordnete verlangen zwingend die ver ffentlichung der angaben
910255 die klage einiger lichtscheuer abgeordneter darf nicht die umsetzung demokratisch gefasster beschl sse um jahre verz gern das schadet dem ansehen des parlaments
910256 die klagenden abgeordneten haben bei gericht nicht einmal einen eilantrag gestellt
910257 es scheint herrn lammert ausschlie lich um eine verz gerung der ver ffentlichungspflicht zu gehen
910258 das vorgehen von herrn lammert bedeutet einen r ckschritt in sachen transparenz obwohl vom bundestag eine ausweitung beschlossen wurde ein grotesker vorgang
910259 vor dem hintergrund der aktuell geltenden seuchensituation vogelgrippe sollte jeder landwirt daf r sorge tragen dass betriebsfremden personen kein zutritt auf das betriebs und hofgel nde gestattet wird mit diesem argument l sst sich wom glich auch der ein oder andere l stige demonstrant abschrecken den mitdemonstrierenden landwirten sollte bewusst sein dass verb nde wie greenpeace bund oder nabu bei der kleinsten verfehlung in bezug auf pflanzenschutz oder einsatz von d ngemitteln sofort auch wieder gegen sie demonstrieren werden landwirte sollten sich nicht unn tz von diesen verb nden instrumentalisieren lassen
910260 ihr bekommt etwas mehr geld f r erneuerbare energien wir l ngere laufzeiten der atommeiler
910261 die mitteilung von tatsachen ber dritte f r die der abgeordnete gesetzliche zeugnisverweigerungsrechte oder verschwiegenheitspflichten geltend machen kann
910262 wir haben keinerlei erfahrung mit einer mehrwertsteuererh hung in dieser gr enordnung
910263 wir k nnen nur hoffen dass der r ckschlag bei der nachfrage nicht so heftig ausf llt dass er den aufschwung zur ckwirft
910264 pr zise abgrenzung und grunds tzlicher ausschluss von nuklearforschung und entwicklung
910265 im einvernehmen mit dem bundeskanzleramt und dem bundesministerium f r wirtschaft und arbeit dieser zugestimmt hat
910266 wird sich die mehrheit durchsetzen und die ist f r die verl ngerung der laufzeiten
910267 keine schutzma nahmen gegen den zuf lligen absturz eines milit rflugzeuges
910268 heute w ren diese ltesten atommeiler wollte man sie neu in betrieb nehmen gar nicht mehr genehmigungsf hig
910269 zahlreichen wirtschaftlichen und juristischen unsicherheiten eines m glichen klageweges oder eines m glichen ministererlaubnisverfahrens
910270 die unterzeichner vertreten au enseiterpositionen die in der sozialdemokratie absolut isoliert sind und bleiben die steigb gelhilfe f r die penetranten versuche aus teilen von cdu und csu den koalitionsvertrag in einem seiner zentralen punkte auszuhebeln wird misslingen
910271 damit bauen die gro en energiekonzerne ihre vormachtstellung aus im schlimmsten fall bei fehlinvestitionen oder konkurs sind die gelder nicht mehr vorhanden wenn der r ckbau ansteht dann sind es letztlich die steuerzahler die daf r aufkommen m ssen
910272 dass dem gericht schlicht die courage fehlte die sache durchzuziehen
910273 einen energiemix in dem auch die atomkraft eine rolle spielt
910274 wenn sich die steuerentwicklung im lauf des jahres weiter verbessert sollte man diese frage ende des jahres noch einmal neu stellen
910275 hochrangige arbeitsgruppe aus drei vertretern der bundesregierung unter vorsitz des kanzleramtschefs
910276 wenn das gentechnikgesetz nicht mehr sicherstellt dass die deutschen bauern uns weiterhin gentechnikfreie rohstoffe zu angemessenen preisen anbieten k nnen m ssen wir verst rkt im ausland einkaufen um risiken und kosten gering zu halten auf dauer stellt sich dann die frage nach dem standort unserer produktion
910277 insgesamt hat sich die deutsche wirtschaft im jahre 2005 nur verhalten positiv entwickelt problematisch blieben vor allem die lage auf dem arbeitsmarkt und die schwache binnennachfrage
910278 wir werden an den bisherigen zeitpl nen zur abschaltung von modernsten kernkraftwerken nicht festhalten k nnen wir brauchen gerade wegen der steigenden energiekosten mehr denn je einen energiemix und die kernenergie z hlt dazu die energiepolitik ist neben der gesundheitspolitik ein wichtiger bereich in dem die koalitionsvereinbarung nachgebessert werden sollte
910279 derzeit kein vern nftiges argument daf r die laufzeit von neueren und damit sichereren akw zu verk rzen um ltere problemreaktoren wie biblis a l nger am netz zu halten es sei denn man will damit verhindern dass in dieser legislaturperiode atomkraftwerke abgeschaltet werden das widerspr che aber dem geist des atomausstiegsvertrags den die energieversorgungsunternehmen unterschrieben haben die wussten sehr genau was sie taten pacta sunt servanda
910280 den gr ten teil der h heren mehrwertsteuer werden die unternehmen aus der lohnsumme begleichen m ssen mehr anreize f r besch ftigung entstehen so nicht
910281 es kommt die zeit in der das w nschen wieder hilft
910282 das jahr 2007 wird zum makro konomischen schicksalsjahr der neuen bundesregierung
910283 eigentlich sollten durch die h hrere mehrwertsteuer die lohnnebenkosten gesenkt werden nun passiert das direkte gegenteil
910284 das ist ja wie weihnachten dann hat die aktion ja schnell erfolg gehabt
910285 weil man mit ffentlichen protesten aber auch mit zweifeln in den eigenen reihen rechnet
910286 wir m ssen das jetzt beherzt auf den weg bringen
910287 von wem erhalten bundestagsabgeordnete eigentlich sonst noch wie viel geld
910288 ich halte es f r erforderlich dass wir uns die zeit nehmen einige unklarheiten und m glicherweise unangemessene anforderungen der neuen verhaltensregeln einer weiteren beratung zu unterziehen
910289 diese vorgabe bewirkt nach meiner auffassung f r freiberufler selbst ndige unternehmer und landwirte zun chst einen er rterungsw rdigen aufwand dar ber hinaus stellen sich ernste fragen des grundrechtsschutzes im hinblick auf die abgeordneten beziehungsweise deren kunden klienten mitgesellschafter und andere vertragspartner
910290 sollte sich keine verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen lage einstellen bleibe ich bei meiner ablehnenden haltung hinsichtlich einer mehrwertsteuererh hung
910291 ich halte die von cdu csu und spd vereinbarte erh hung der mehrwertsteuer zum 1 1 2007 im hinblick auf die dringend notwendige stabilisierung der ffentlichen haushalte und die beabsichtigte reduzierung des beitragssatzes zur arbeitslosenversicherung von 6 5 auf 4 5 prozent f r richtig
910292 damit wusste die mehrheit dass eine steuererh hung auf der agenda der cdu stand
910293 so wird bei der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung eine anhebung des beitragssatzes um vier zehntel bereits eingeplant bei der krankenversicherung und bei der arbeitslosenversicherung zeichnen sich aus heutiger sicht engp sse ab eine dauerhafte senkung der lohnzusatzkosten unter 40 kann nicht erreicht werden
910294 zwei prozent merkel steuer ein prozent m nte steuer obendrauf
910295 jetzt kommen zwei prozent merkel steuer und ein prozent m nte steuer noch obendrauf
910296 der private konsum wird damit kaum zu einer konjunkturellen erholung beitragen k nnen
910297 sowie bei den hausfrauen und berufst tigen in einfacher und mittlerer lebenslage verschlechtert
910298 andere standorte auf ihre eignung als endlager untersucht und mit gorleben verglichen
910299 einfach zu sagen in gorleben haben wir nun mal angefangen und deshalb machen wir dort weiter das kann und will ich jedenfalls nicht verantworten sich schon jetzt auf diesen standort festzulegen halte ich f r unvertretbar nachfolgenden generationen und den dort lebenden menschen gegen ber
910300 dass die standards f r die staatliche atomaufsicht und f r das sicherheitsmanagement in den deutschen kernkraftwerken nicht mehr weltspitze sind
910301 mir ist jedenfalls kein argument bekannt das daf r sprechen w rde klar ist dass nach geltenden vertr gen ein solcher antrag die ausnahme bleiben muss
910302 die letzten tage haben gezeigt dass der widerstand gegen eine politik die auf kosten der kommenden generationen betrieben wird nicht kleinzukriegen ist mit einer mischung aus effektiven kleingruppenaktionen und massenhaftem zivilen ungehorsam haben wir deutlich gemacht dass wir das weiter so in der atompolitik nicht akzeptieren werden
910303 letztlich wird rund um gorleben der konflikt ber das ungel ste atomm llproblem nur stellvertretend f r die ganze gesellschaft ausgetragen frau merkel hat sich schon einmal w hrend ihrer zeit als umweltministerin am widerstand im wendland die z hne ausgebissen sie macht einen gro en fehler wenn sie jetzt auf den weiterbetrieb der atomkraftwerke setzt
910304 wir m ssen endlich zu ende pr fen ob der standort gorleben f r ein atomares endlager geeignet ist oder nicht
910305 seit 25 jahren lassen wir die menschen im ungewissen es muss jetzt so schnell wie m glich klarheit geben
910306 es muss berpr ft werden ob es nicht andere geeignete standorte gibt
910307 dass es keine gesteinsformation gibt die sich besser eignet als andere
910308 der ball liegt jetzt also wieder in der spielh lfte der politik
910309 wir erwarten dass das transport moratorium genutzt wird um eine deutliche wende in der atompolitik einzuleiten hin zu einem ausstieg der diesen namen wirklich verdient denn nur ein ende der atomm ll produktion kann das bis heute ungel ste problem eingrenzen
910310 die erkundung des salzstocks in gorleben wird bis zur kl rung konzeptioneller und sicherheitstechnischer fragen f r l ngstens zehn jahre unterbrochen
910311 die suche wird schneller und weniger in die tiefe gehen
910312 wir beabsichtigen in dieser legislatur zu einer l sung zu kommen
910313 zwischen cdu csu und spd bestehen hinsichtlich der nutzung der kernenergie zur stromerzeugung unterschiedliche auffassungen deshalb kann die zwischen bundesregierung und energieversorgungsunternehmen geschlossene vereinbarung nicht ge ndert werden
910314 die erh hung der mehrwertsteuer auf 19 wird nat rlich eine d mpfung der konjunktur zur folge haben
910315 von einer mehrwertsteuererh hung sind negative gesamtwirtschaftliche folgen zu erwarten sie f hrt zu einem entzug von kaufkraft und d mpft die binnennachfrage weiter
910316 den streit kann man offen halten da gibt es derzeit keinen handlungsbedarf
910317 mit jedem tag mehr an laufzeit w chst die strahlungslast f r zuk nftige generationen
910318 weitere transporte nach gorleben gef hrden den landfrieden und lassen die fr heren mahnungen von robert jungk wahr werden dass ein solcher atomstaat die demokratie zerst rt wir brauchen endlich eine verteilung der entsorgungslasten auf alle bundesl nder wer die atomenergie so super findet soll auch seinen m ll bernehmen
910319 den staat als castortransport und wasserwerfer erleben der sie von der stra e spritzt
910320 am kommenden samstag 13 00 uhr in l neburg kommt da genau zur rechten zeit nehmen sie teil und helfen sie mit ein starkes zeichen nach berlin zu senden
910321 um den co2 ausstoss weiter wie erforderlich zu reduzieren kann es allerdings f r eine begrenzte zeit erforderlich sein verst rkt atomenergie zur stromerzeugung in der grundlast einzusetzen
910322 das ist der bare energiepolitische unverstand peinlich dass ver di chef bsirske in diesem bund der ewiggestrigen mitturnt
910323 nach ber drei jahrzehnten mitgliedschaft in der gewerkschaft ver di bzw ihrer vorg ngergewerschaften k ndige ich hiermit meine mitgliedschaft
910324 diese erkl rung ist in ihrem inhalt identisch mit dem zeitgleichen energiepolitischen vorsto des bdi
910325 sie fordert nicht nur die aufk ndigung des gesetzlich beschlossenen ausstiegs aus der atomenergienutzung gleichzeitig zielt sie auf die beschr nkung des weiteren ausbaus erneuerbarer energien
910326 mir ist v llig unverst ndlich wie sich die gewerkschaft ver di in dieser frappierenden weise mit den interessen der gro en energiekonzerne gemein macht deren konzentrationsprozess in den letzten jahren zahlreiche stadtwerke zum opfer gefallen sind und die weit ber 100 000 arbeitspl tze abgebaut haben ebenso unverst ndlich ist dass sich ver di zu denjenigen gesellt die den weiteren ausbau erneuerbarer energien ausbremsen wollen
910327 ver di hat sich immer f r einen geregelten atomausstieg ausgesprochen daran ndert sich nichts
910328 um den co 2 aussto weiter wie erforderlich zu reduzieren k nne es f r eine begrenzte zeit erforderlich sein im rahmen des atomkonsenses verst rkt atomenergie zur stromerzeugung einzusetzen dabei k nne es zur bertragung von produktionsrechten zwischen den kernkraftwerken kommen wobei die einhaltung von optimalen sicherheitsstandards gew hrleistet sein m sse
910329 es ist eine frage des anstands dass man sich an das h lt was man verhandelt vereinbart und unterzeichnet hat n mlich den atomausstieg
910330 w rde in zukunft die laufzeitverl ngerung von einer anderen regierung ganz aufgehoben h tte man noch alle meiler zur verf gung
910331 merkel m ntefering und stoiber werden erwartungsgem unser land regieren jetzt ist es gut wenn nicht nur gut bezahlte und mit hunderten mitarbeitern ausgestattete lobbygruppen von atom und gentechnikindustrie ihre forderungen ausdr cken und stimmung machen
910332 auch wir k nnen und sollten mit demonstrationen leserbriefen usw eindringlich auf die ungel sten atomprobleme hinweisen und unerm dlich fordern 1 energieeinsparen 2 energieeffizienz und 3 erneuerbare energien
910333 wir wollen mit diesem preis dem kampf gegen atomwaffen wirklich neuen auftrieb geben
910334 ich kann jetzt nicht sondierungs oder koalitionsverhandlungen vorwegnehmen aber ich glaube nicht dass es sich um ein un berwindbares hindernis handelt
910335 keine regierung kann sich mehr um diese frage dr cken deswegen muss der erkundungsstopp f r gorleben aufgehoben werden die pr fung ist dann ergebnisoffen
910336 im wendland aber d rfte es f r die ampelkoalition aus cdu fdp und gr nen mindestens heimliche f rsprecher geben nur bei einer regierungsbeteiligung behielten die gr nen einfluss auf die entscheidung ob in gorleben die vom gr nen bundesumweltminister j rgen trittin ausgesetzte erkundung des salzstocks als m gliches endlager f r hochradioaktiven m ll weitergeht
910337 es ist eine frage des anstands dass man sich an das h lt was man verhandelt vereinbart und unterzeichnet hat n mlich den atomausstieg
910338 kontrolle ber die forschungsprogramme ergebnisse und publikationen der rzte der who ber die gesundheitlichen folgen der zivilen nutzung der atomenergie und deren unf lle
910339 an die gr nen gewandt sagte er f r den fall da eine rot gr ne koalition fortgesetzt werden solle m sse es erhebliche nderungen in der energiepolitik geben das bezog sich auf fragen der kernenergie und des exports kerntechnischer anlagen
910340 ich bin fest davon berzeugt selbst wenn man das nicht h ren mag dass wir eine neue philosophie brauchen f r die kernkraft wir d rfen uns nicht erlauben unsere abh ngigkeit von l und gas immer weiter zu erh hen wir werden erst die laufzeiten der jetzigen anlagen verl ngern m ssen und dann irgendwann auch neue atomkraftwerke bauen
910341 leben und gesundheit von millionen sind eine denkbar untaugliche verhandlungsmasse deshalb verlangen wir einen von akw laufzeiten unabh ngigen ausbau der erneuerbaren energien und ein sofortiges ende des riskanten abenteuers atomkraft
910342 die anti atom sonne ist wieder zur ck und sie lacht wie eh und je
910343 es wird am ende gar nicht m glich sein so schnell auf ko energie umzustellen wie die rot gr ne regierung das gerne h tte das braucht zeit und geht nur langsam so lange sollten die atomkraftwerke auf alle f lle noch in betrieb bleiben die idee von kanzlerkandidatin merkel ist nicht schlecht aber 2020 ist zu sp t ich denke ein schrittweiser atomausstieg bis 2015 w re sinnvoller
910344 zwar h ten sich cdu und fdp das kernkraftthema allzu prominent zu verfolgen aber ihre erkl rte absicht ist die laufzeitverl ngerung f r kernkraftwerke das wird rger geben hier meine prognose
910345 der bundesrat ist nicht f r die verhaltensregeln des bundestages zust ndig
910346 die eu braucht obligatorische registrierungs und transparenzregeln f r lobbyisten um solche praktiken effektiv zu verhindern
910347 die soziet t ihre bisherige t tigkeit in diesem bereich die in deutschland zum beispiel die beratung der deutschen telekom w hrend der anfangsphase der liberalisierung namhafter europ ischer pc hersteller bez glich handelspolitischer ma nahmen der kommission gegen ber herstellern von speicherbausteinen oder zahlreicher pharma und biotechunternehmen umfasst auf eine formale grundlage
910348 wenn die rocard vorschl ge nicht im plenum akzeptiert werden werde ich die richtlinie ablehnen
910349 some say that this directive will protect the small and middle business the truth is the directly opposite look at who supports and who opposes the directive all supporters of the software patents are multinational megacorporations all smbs that have expressed an opinion are against the patents
910350 b rgerinnen und b rgern hinreichende informationen dar ber ob und wie der abgeordnete den w hlerauftrag umsetzt
910351 durch die m glichen vorgezogenen neuwahlen pr sentiert rot gr n nun vorschl ge die wir zum teil noch nicht f r ausgewogen halten

910359 if the camps had really been stupid and wasteful and tragic that meant that the soviet union was stupid and wasteful and tragic too
910360 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
910361 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
910362 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence

910365 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
910366 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
910367 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
910368 no similar weapon in the service of armies in the world
910369 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
910370 people started pushing their way back and many women and children fell down whoever fell down was trampled upon by the surge of devotees

910394 nothing works in those places not cell phones not anything
910395 it was the best bit of technology i took with me it worked like a walkie talkie i could use it for free phone calls and text messages
910396 but i need to rest up first maybe in a couple months

910398 this is an incredibly easy high quality way to connect with friends and family just give it a try and be amazed by the magic of video communications and the new features that make skype 4 0 easier than ever to use
910399 give us another try and see what you can do now and how far we have come because its magic it really is magic
910400 dude multitasking is sooo 1990s lets make skype really huge and clunky so our users will be forced to enjoy our great product exclusively without any distractions from other applications
910401 what an awesome idea this way they simply have to use all our fantastic features they wont have another choice
910402 we realise that some people will prefer to have a smaller contact list only window
910403 and we will be addressing this by the time 4 0 comes out of beta
910404 we would however like to encourage you to stick with the full window for a while so we can get feedback on this new style of working with skype we think most people will prefer it having got used to it we certainly do
910405 although it would be great if you could leave you feedback via
910406 it would be great if you could leave you feedback via i assure you we will be making changes based on the feedback we receive
910407 because the majority of requests require research to resolve it can sometimes take us up to 48 hours to respond though we make every effort to get back to you as quickly as possible and most queries are answered within 24 hours

910417 if you hear of a rate that seems to be much better than the rest of market get it in writing and lock it in
910418 more than 60 days and the lender is usually looking for cash up front
910419 and all we had time to do was to get the customers we were already working with into the loan
910420 most lenders wont take your rate down with them unless rates drop substantially then they may give you the new rate plus an eighth of a point
910421 inflation has gone from the back burner to the front
910422 thus is was that alexander solzhenitsyn and the gulag archipelago were born within weeks of each other children of the same revolution
910423 mr solzhenitsyn had been an obscure middle aged unpublished high school teacher in a provincial russian town when he burst onto the literary stage in 1962 with a day in the life of ivan denishovich
910424 is not to partake in falsehood not to support false actions
910425 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others in keeping silent about evil in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface we are implanting it and it will rise up a thousandfold in the future when we neither punish nor reproach evildoers we are not simply protecting their trivial old age we are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations
910426 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times

910433 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
910434 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
910435 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
910436 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
910437 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
910438 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
910439 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
910440 there may be tickets on ebay that are delivered but i think it is a great risk that would be my message

910452 in het eerste halfjaar ontwikkelden onze businesses inclusief de activiteiten die werden overgenomen van abn amro zich bevredigend onder de turbulente marktomstandigheden de kosten worden scherp in het oog gehouden maar toch constateren wij dat het bedrijfsklimaat op verschillende fronten lastiger wordt

910455 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission mr barltett said
910456 the deputy premier and i are here to make a short statement and we will not be taking questions afterwards
910457 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
910458 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
910459 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
910460 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
910461 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
910462 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
910463 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
910464 in the interim i will be undertaking her portfolio roles
910465 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government
910466 i will respect their right to make a decision on further comments regarding her condition
910467 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint
910468 my thoughts and those of all government mps are very much with paula

910476 ich bin nicht berrascht dass man sebastian vettel in die formel 1 geholt hat aber er h tte nicht vor mir dort sein sollen
910477 man kann die tatsache nicht ignorieren dass es in diesem gesch ft viel politik gibt und es einem weiterhilft wenn man vom europ ischen festland oder dem mittleren osten kommt
910478 denn dorthin orientiert sich die formel 1 und es sorgt ganz klar f r noch mehr interesse in den neuen formel 1 l ndern wenn sie einen eigenen fahrer haben den sie anfeuern k nnen

910481 am besten macht man auf sich aufmerksam wenn man weiter siegt und ich werde mein bestes geben um den titel zu holen ich bin noch jung aber um ehrlich zu sein kann ich nicht nur rumh ngen wenn ich mir einen platz in der formel 1 verdienen will sollte ich es mit 25 jahren allerdings noch nicht dorthin geschafft haben bin ich realistisch genug zu akzeptieren dass es nichts mehr wird
910482 es gibt hunderte von jungen piloten die ihr bestes geben um von sich zu berzeugen deshalb kann man es sich nicht leisten auf irgendwelche geschenke zu warten es ist vielleicht ein bisschen so wie wenn man ein top fu baller werden will man ist f r manchester united arsenal oder chelsea nicht interessant wenn man jeden samstag bei bathgate thistle aufl uft

910484 los estudios realizados en el pa s se alan que el mal uso de antibi ticos atb en argentina se ubica entre un 45 y un 70 esto significa que entre la mitad y los dos tercios de los atb son mal utilizados
910485 m s del 85 de las infecciones respiratorias altas anginas otitis resfr os y gripes tan comunes en invierno son de origen viral y su evoluci n no se modifica en absoluto con el uso de atb estos f rmacos s lo atacan a las bacterias sin embargo los estudios coinciden en que entre un 50 y un 75 de las consultas m dicas por estos cuadros estacionales terminan con la prescripci n de un atb
910486 casi todos los estudios revelan que se usan m s atb en ni os que en adultos es m s cerca del 30 del total se utiliza en menores de 10 a os la principal causa del problema ser a la presi n de las madres para que les prescriban atb a sus hijos
910487 cuando un m dico se encuentra con un ni o con fiebre y catarro y tiene dudas sobre el compromiso respiratorio muchas veces receta un atb cuando en ocho de cada diez casos no suele ser necesario la insistencia de los padres para que mediquen al ni o es fuerte
910488 el problema es que si un ni o toma atb inncesariamente el germen empieza a generar resistencia y uno se ve obligado a usar drogas cada vez m s fuertes y con m s efectos adversos debemos recurrir a los intramusculares y a veces hasta nos vemos obligados a internar
910489 operan varios factores dice levy hara el bajo nivel de formaci n del profesional la escasa capacitaci n de posgrado el poco tiempo entre consultas es m s f cil prescribir un atb que explicar medidas de cuidado no farmacol gicas como reposo antit rmicos y nebulizaciones la presi n de los padres para que medique al chico las relaciones con la industria farmac utica que tambi n inciden por el tipo de informaci n que recibe el profesional m s sesgada y el temor a las consecuencias legales un problema que se repite cada vez con mayor frecuencia
910490 el tema de los juicios multiplica esta conducta de prescripci n por las dudas a veces el m dico receta un atb de manera preventiva por si el paciente evoluciona hacia un cuadro que lo requiera y eso no deber a ocurrir muchas efaecciones respiratorias se curan solas
910491 el uso indebido de atb es una tendencia creciente en todo el mundo
910492 argentina no es excepci n es un problema dif cil de atacar porque operan cuestiones culturales muy fuertes
910493 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
910494 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
910495 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
910496 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver
910497 i am not going to apologize for something that we are not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese are running the internet in china
910498 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
910499 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
910500 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
910501 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
910502 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
910503 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
910504 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
910505 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
910506 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
910507 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest

910509 nature has endowed the great white shark with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
910510 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
910511 i am passing this message on to gb not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
910512 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb ie this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc
910513 strategically the consequence was twofold a we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and b because we were disowning ourselves as a government we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
910514 so tactically we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but strategically we ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda
910515 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
910516 the truth is that dc was in trouble long before tb left but that was because he was being forced to choose on nl policy and found as a result that he couldnt differentiate properly
910517 the choice is and was always between gb running as the change candidate or as continuity nl he never needed to worry about distancing on iraq it was never going to be seen as his issue but he really needed to be seen as continuing nl not ditching it by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term
910518 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
910519 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
910520 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game

910545 greg and i are friends i see him a lot in the off season
910546 when its all said and done after the game well maybe a couple of days after you appreciate what hes done
910547 but during the game no im not going to give him that credit im trying to beat him
910548 i know what to expect from him and hell still dupe you
910549 he can get you out with a pitch and he wont throw it again you never know what youll get from him

910565 the president is once again releasing american military might on a foreign country with an ill defined objective and no exit strategy he has yet to tell the congress how much this operation will cost and he has not informed our nations armed forces about how long they will be away from home these strikes do not make for a sound foreign policy
910566 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
910567 well i just think its a bad idea whats going to happen is theyre going to be over there for 10 15 maybe 20 years
910568 there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our overextended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
910569 victory means exit strategy and its important for the president to explain to us what the exit strategy is

910579 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
910580 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
910581 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
910582 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
910583 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
910584 in the early 1970s we discovered bluefin tuna north of the canso causeway
910585 a friend had all the gear to catch it we went out and within an hour we had a strike it took 3 hours but we landed an 800 pound bluefin
910586 because it was caught with sporting equipment the federal government legislated that all tuna fishing be done with sport gear its still on the books but im not sure if its being observed because it was fished with sporting gear it meant less depletion of stocks our fishermen even charter their boats to sport fishermen from the states and elsewhere who then give their catch back to our people to sell
910587 i got harvesters interested and the industry ran for many years until disease set in and we lost the product on the eastern shore there are still a few spots in cape breton but the catch is nothing to speak of the last couple of years japan is the only market for sea urchins where its used in high grade sushi
910588 i put out a call for interested kids 12 and under and thought id get a dozen or so fifty seven showed up we formed a league and by the next year had sponsors uniforms and 700 to 800 people attending our games a couple of years later there were lots of coaches so i dropped away
910589 we called it a return to tradition and had a great event with dances pageants suppers and dinners boat races sporting events concerts fireworks and childrens events weather put a bit of a damper on it this year but we still had great attendance
910590 ive never seen a fine weather day on nov 11 but the veterans really look forward to the beef stew i make
910591 its because of the people i like to keep from being bored and feel i have to entertain others so they wont be bored i hate to see potential wasted
910592 if you dont step in and help with the development of people the potential goes to waste
910593 most people hate to do it but they sure enjoy the results
910594 you could tell from their body language as they were being introduced that they were uncomfortable being honoured
910595 volunteering is an attractive social arena all volunteers have something in common and they are happy to be together sharing it and providing activity for others
910596 this is not a year for big new spending projects or big new tax reductions
910597 i know you must be wondering why im calling after so long
910598 its like this i know i told you before that my last name was genarro ive been going by that since my parents got divorced but my legal name is still lucy mcclane yeah like the guy whos been in the news the last few days im his daughter
910599 see after mom ditched him i kind of decided that my dad was an asshole and that i wanted no part of him
910600 how many people have died because i told you no what if i could have saved my dad before he got shot if id taken you up on that offer of training being super strong isnt worth shit if you dont know what to do with it and i dont think i can just sit on this any more
910601 so sign me up slayer mcclane reporting for duty just tell me where to go

910603 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
910604 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
910605 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
910606 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
910607 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
910608 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
910609 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
910610 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
910611 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
910612 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
910613 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
910614 we dont have any evidence before us that qantas safety systems are not working or that there are links between these events or that there are any safety problems within qantas
910615 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
910616 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
910617 about right and 28 per cent thought they were not tough enough
910618 in discussions with both governments i will cover matters of mutual interest including the response to the breakdown in the world trade organisation doha round of negotiations global financial uncertainty regional architecture and climate change mr rudd said
910619 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world he said
910620 this will involve those serious breaches not for minor things like forgetting to close a lid on a rubbish bin but serious breaches of licence conditions as well as prosecutions
910621 i would hope that in the future we have no one in the list
910622 ku believes that this initiative will assist parents when making the important decision about who will care for their children
910623 todays announcement will do nothing to get more children into preschool or reduce the fees faced by struggling families
910624 absolute claims which could be at risk of breaching the trade practices act if the fairtrade certification process was not 100 per cent reliable
910625 fairtrade aims to give farmers and producers a much fairer deal and we strongly believe in that she said
910626 fairtrade does not serve the interests of the poor director of the institutes free trade unit tim wilson said
910627 one year we had a party and squashed 54 people inside but i wouldnt recommend that
910628 when baobabs are more than 1 000 years old they hollow naturally
910629 we found the remains of a bushmen bed made from rocks possibly in the 1700s
910630 we could also gather that a voortrekker once lived here who repaired ox wagons for the great trek because we found tools and wagon pieces
910631 the baobab is a sacred tree in african culture if a baby drinks a mixture of its bark and water it is said to grow up mighty and powerful
910632 our sympathy goes out to the family following this tragic death
910633 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
910634 wet sand as we have had today after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
910635 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
910636 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
910637 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
910638 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
910639 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time she said
910640 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
910641 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
910642 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said
910643 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
910644 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
910645 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
910646 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
910647 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign

910649 whatever the reason for the movement of the pregnant mother one must have grave concerns that the child will not be born into a better life but taken from the mother and forced into a life of exploitation which may also be quite short mr pascoe said
910650 this is an issue which goes to our own humanity he said
910651 in doing nothing when the rights of others especially those who have no voice are debased we debase ourselves
910652 americans have the right and advantage of being armed unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms
910653 those who want to reap the benefits of this great nation must bear the fatigue of supporting it
910654 boasted of being involved in the transport of wmd warheads to syria
910655 they knew the locations of the missile hulls buried in iraq
910656 wanted to trade their information for a release from prison and were amenable to showing the locations
910657 wanted since he took power to embarrass the west and this was the perfect opportunity to do so
910658 a clean bill of health from the u n and then the program could be kick started easily
910659 when the cross is considered in the context of the larger memorial and especially the numerous other secular elements the primary effect is patriotic and nationalistic not religious
910660 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily non religious messages of military service death and sacrifice
910661 for all americans who care about our young men and women who have sacrificed their lives in defense of our country
910662 sadly i fully expect the aclu attorneys to appeal this decision to the 9th circuit court of appeals so this fight is not over
910663 for religious and non religious events including easter sunrise services some of which have been broadcast to troops overseas veterans reunions memorial services weddings and family gatherings
910664 there is no history of discrimination between religious and nonreligious gropus in the issuance of municipal permits to use the site
910665 in fact in terms of the number of elements the memorial comprises secular symbols predominate with over 2 000 individual memorial plaques 23 military bollards numerous inscribed paving stones a tall flagpole and large american flag and a bronze plaque commemorating the dedication of the memorial in 1954 and except for the cross there are no other religious elements such as altars statues religious texts or a chapel
910666 the physical setting of the memorial moreover neither compels nor encourages religious devotion for one thing physical access to the cross is blocked by an iron fence also there are no benches immediately adjacent to and facing the cross nor any other fixtures or devotional trappings inviting veneration of the cross
910667 finally the location of the memorial makes it an unlikely venue for government indoctrination located away from the hub of downtown and the seat of government mt soledad park is more a destination than a way station
910668 mt soledad becomes a place to reflect on our past be inspired by true patriots and offer war veterans our heartfelt gratitude for the freedom we all enjoy today
910669 are not going to be able to take that cross down and they should just deal with it
910670 we are confident that when this case reaches the supreme court justice will finally prevail and put an end to this fanatical litigation of atheists and others backed by the aclu
910671 is great news not only for veterans but for all freedom loving americans it has been a long battle and may not be completely over but when good people take on a good cause they will eventually succeed over evil
910672 continue to stand as long as it takes with our allies in the thomas more law center and the in the legal fight to protect mt soledad national veterans memorial and all other veterans memorials from desecration by the abusive legal assaults of the aclu and others who have no respect for veterans or our american heritage
910673 virginia has legitimately chosen to protect innocent life from a terrible procedure and the court is right to revisit the decision against virginias law
910674 the decision of the three judge panel conflicts significantly with the supreme courts ruling over a year ago upholding the federal ban
910675 the abortionists pursuing this case show an obsessive devotion to abortion that they think trumps reasonable public policy decisions
910676 there is a real choice in the 2008 presidential election
910677 the choice is to vote for none of the above its the only choice that makes sense its the only choice that will make a real difference for the future of our country its the only choice that is moral and justifiable from both a pragmatic point of view as well as an idealistic one
910678 in all honesty the choices put before us this year by the two major parties make george bush look like george washington by comparison
910679 dont believe the experts theyre not looking deeply enough at whats happening out there in the grass roots
910680 i dont think americans have really considered how powerful it is to vote no the soviet union imploded when russians said no no is a very powerful word it is a revolutionary word and america is in need of a political revolution a revolution that gives voters real choices
910681 how can any of us be a part of knowingly sending america on the wrong course
910682 many people who believe in these principles principles most closely associated with the republican party think holding your nose and voting for john mccain is the right thing to do in 2008
910683 i disagree if mccain wins he will have done it his way with an incoherent platform that promotes global warming hysteria embryonic stem cell research unconstitutional restrictions on first amendment freedoms more illegal immigration etc
910684 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails and you know the latest one theyve got me in an ad with paris hilton you know never met the woman but but you know what theyre gonna try to argue is that somehow im too risky
910685 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
910686 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city

910713 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
910714 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown

910734 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
910735 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
910736 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
910737 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
910738 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea

910799 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
910800 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
910801 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter

910910 im so happy i cannot really believe it we have been near the top of the leader board in all the sessions this weekend so we knew that we had a good race set up the team worked hard to give me a great bike for both races and finally we have a win no two wins to celebrate it wasnt easy i found it difficult to pass and i made a couple of mistakes in race one i was very nervous for the last few laps but in race two i was able to keep a good pace right to the end
910911 i cannot say that i am happy with the results but i have to be satisfied after the problems we have had this weekend of course brands hatch was a new circuit for me to learn and we found it difficult to find a good setting for the bike i had a problem with the left hander going onto the back of the circuit and this is a corner you must get right to carry speed for the rest of the lap
910912 im quite disappointed to tell the truth as i hoped to do a lot better today by the last few laps of the first race the rear tyre wear was pretty bad and thats why we changed the tyre before race two unfortunately that was the wrong choice and there wasnt much i could do after the first few laps i am however happy with podium in race one as those 20 points have meant that ive increased my overall lead even though its by just a few points that was a great race this morning and my congratulations go to kiyo who really was fantastic here today
910913 in race one the tyres were a real problem we chose a harder tyre but it wasnt right so we went for a softer option for race two which although better did not perform as we had hoped in both races my right forearm the one already operated on was playing up again and although i went to the clinica mobile after race 1 for some treatment i still experienced pain throughout the second race im pretty satisfied with the fact that i was able to make up so many positions in race two though to finish in sixth place taking valuable points in the process
910914 every time i went out on the bike i learnt more and more and its great to be back on a superbike the bike felt brilliant and i was happy with the race set up in the end my fitness level is good but i need to get into the gym to work on my arm strength as i had to lose weight to ride the supersport i was desperate to get into the points this weekend so overall im pretty happy with my performance the boys have done me proud and im chuffed to be part of the team theyve all made me feel really welcome and i cant wait to get to donington
910915 we made some good improvements to the bike in the second race and we put in some good lap times we were consistent once again and within the points but i wasnt able to improve much on my qualifying position during the race so we have to keep working hard on set up and move up to the next level which i hope we can achieve at donington brands is a track which i have beaten kiyo on before in the bsb so it was really great to see him win the double here and i want to congratulate him

910927 but the rapid changes in myopia prevalence are not consistent with a simple genetic determination since gene pools do not change sufficiently fast
910928 time spent outdoors as a protective factor now appears to be the strongest environmental factor that has yet been documented
910929 the release of dopamine from the retina is promoted by higher light intensities and there is also evidence that dopamine can act as an inhibitor of eye growth
910930 this provides a very plausible mechanism by which time spent outdoors could prevent the development of myopia

910938 every one feels it has made them more productive and the frustration levels have disappeared
910939 so many people continually feel overloaded stressed and frustrated and they cant put their finger on why the fact is that we are bringing this on ourselves by not questioning the cyber centric interruption laden lifestyle that is eroding our capacity for deep focus and awareness
910940 and when you examine them many of our constant workplace distractions are ultimately secondary or trivial matters
910941 in many cases people are ending up interrupting themselves and it is just a matter of taking the effort to create a better environment for thought
910942 everyones brain is wired a little differently and there are things that work well for some but not for others so experimentation is important to find the best solution for each individual
910943 we just need to push back from the extreme and learn to pay more attention to ourselves rather than the distractions that are defining our lives

910978 for the marketers who are afraid of losing control of the online conversation you were never in control more people now just have louder voices
910979 any increase in transaction tax as proposed would increase the transaction cost and may keep farmers and hedgers out of the market an outcome which would fail to achieve the objectives of commodity futures markets
910980 therefore any increase in transaction cost would lead to lower trading activity and higher volatility
910981 we are excited to have ifc assist us in expanding our operations we see ifc as a long term strategic partner and value its knowledge of the private health care sector in emerging markets

910983 mungkin kakangmas arya penangsang benar benar sekadar ingin mengisi kekakuan suasana yang menegangkan ini tetapi satu satunya cara adalah demikian
910984 jangan merendahkan diri begitu aku tahu bahwa adimas memiliki ketajaman penglihatan atas jenis jenis pusaka dan benda benda bertuah karena itu biarlah aku melihat keris itu barang sebentar
910985 baiklah kakangmas tetapi kakangmas jangan mentertawakan keris itu keris yang barangkali tidak berarti dibandingkan dengan kiai setan kober yang kakangmas bawa itu

910995 i would like to place on record my thanks to the board players and fans of tottenham for the past six years which were the best and most enjoyable of my career to date
910996 i was incredibly disappointed when i first heard not only that liverpool had been working behind the scenes to bring robbie to anfield but that robbie himself wanted to go and he submitted a transfer request to this effect
910997 i have already made my opinion clear on the nature of this transaction i dont regard it as a transfer deal that is something which happens between two clubs when they both agree to trade this is very much an enforced sale for which we have agreed a sum of 19 million pounds as compensation plus a potential further 1 3 million pounds in additional compensation

911003 we got the building on a future rent basis i e no rent now well pay you rent in the future
911004 and we left it that way because we had no money to do anything with it
911005 we didnt have any money to buy some of the basic things like scales or cash registers so what we did was sell the lobsters by the piece we stuck the money down in our hip waders
911006 its trite to say people are your most valuable asset
911007 but they are its you the people around you the people youre able to attract
911008 you should get as much from us as we get from you
911009 it comes back to empowerment i learned a long time ago that i make a lot of mistakes

911011 the legislatures decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaskan and lower 48 consumers
911012 this ratification of our license under agia will facilitate transcanadas continuing commercial negotiations with potential shippers improving the likelihood of a successful open season and the construction of a natural gas delivery system from prudhoe bay to lower 48 markets
911013 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help
911014 the frustration at canwest is that concerns about the companys debt will continue to overshadow improvements in operations

911017 i think its about time people see the other side of luke
911018 theyve only seen one side of me the luke 2 live crew the girls and thats it a lot of people dont realize some of the contributions that ive made in the hip hop business and that i do have a family i do have a wife and i do run a business
911019 i think its time that people get a look at the different side of me its a real funny show i think people are going to be very entertained its going to be the funniest reality show that people ever saw its going to be a funny family oriented show
911020 quite a few production companies came to me asking me if i could do a show saying we could do a show on who could be the next luke dancer or the next exotic porn star i said i didnt want to do that i wanted to do something totally different so eventually i hooked up with some guys and we shot a pilot of me and at the time my fianc e
911021 i just wanted it because there were a lot of questions throughout the years
911022 ive always told people you should raise your own kids now that my kids are 15 and 17 years old people can see me dealing with the same issues
911023 the most intriguing things that happen in the show are when we get to those different bridges people will find that my kids are no different than their kids
911024 for me its always been im gonna marry the right type of woman her values where she is in life and what im attracted to its got to be somebody that im comfortable with
911025 we became real close friends and i think thats important being a friend first we love being around each other and were best friends we just love each other to death so it just made all the sense in the world
911026 i always wanted to find that somebody thats able to be strong be able to deal with luke and the perception of luke because who i am at home is totally different than who i am on stage im an entertainer on stage thats my job i just wanted to marry somebody who wanted to marry luther campbell not uncle luke
911027 i leave it at the office im a very strict dad but i am a very open dad because i urge my kids to talk to me and we have very open conversations when people see the show hopefully they can learn something
911028 people are going to find that im much more than what this business has portrayed me to be
911029 people are going to get a good idea of who i am and theyre going to find out in a fun way people are going to be very entertained and im just so excited
911030 i will be as harsh as truth and uncompromising as justice i am in earnest i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard
911031 the good news for digital advocates is that digital is the new black the percentage of organisations that will spend more than 50 of their marketing budget on digital media going from 4 in 2007 to 19 in 2013
911032 we also found that the other major trend is that the percentage of organisations who will spend between 25 and 50 of their marketing budget on digital media going from 10 in 2007 to 51 in 2013
911033 so get on board the debate is no longer should i digital rather how should i digital next digital has been doing this for 12 years digital is what we do all day every day so its nice people are listening
911034 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within

911039 a liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man which
911040 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
911041 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
911042 theres nobody hanging around out there waiting for a job theres no one unemployed as a gynecologic oncologist
911043 its often challenging to get people to come to smaller provinces
911044 there is a human resource crisis in our specialty all across canada
911045 this problem has been in newfoundland but it may happen in other provinces
911046 we anticipate that unless this issue is addressed and theres a framework in the federal scene that were going to see this more and more you cant just address this province by province
911047 i can tell you providing a system in which an individuals professional goals can be reached providing high quality care will prevent a disaster
911048 weve got to excite people who are in general obstetric and gynecology
911049 they can get a lot more money delivering babies and theres a lot of demand
911050 nary a peep is heard about the principles involved in political interference

911053 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
911054 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
911055 i have always said and again you can take a look at the language that as commander in chief i would always reserve the right to do whats best in americas national interests
911056 i look forward to being back with this great team
911057 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
911058 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
911059 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
911060 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
911061 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
911062 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
911063 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
911064 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
911065 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
911066 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
911067 the ad using actual spaghetti western footage comparing sprints mobile broadband network to cingulars edge network very clearly depicts how sprint is empowering customers to do more at five times the speed of cingulars edge network

911071 you will get away with much more by begging forgiveness than by asking permission
911072 i think it will be very sad if they dont have enough users to maintain the critical mass because we need more successful mmos in the world not more failures
911073 whether theyve hit the right rhythm longevity gameplay and style depends on the vagaries of the market i know they worked really really hard on it and i know they tried really really hard on it and if they dont make it thats a real shame because thats peoples mortgages
911074 when you hit rock bottom youve got two ways to go
911075 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
911076 blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god
911077 t he poor in judaism referred to those in desperate need socioeconomic element whose helplessness drove them to a dependent relationship with god religious element for the supplying of their needs and vindication
911078 the spirit of the sovereign lord is on me because the lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the lords favor
911079 poor in spirit then signifies those who are brought to the sense of their sins and seeing no goodness in themselves despair in themselves and sue wholly to the mercy of god in christ
911080 it smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car
911081 we know you did it but we know it was a mistake we just need to know why
911082 you are my girlfriend nobody is allowed to see your underwear but me
911083 the verdict left many people in the courtroom upset swearing and crying
911084 i will not be abused i am tired of the bruises i am somebody and dont have to be treated like a nobody strike three youre out
911085 we are befuddled as to why they havent pressed charges its either lack of competency lack of caring lack of making it a priority
911086 your courage courses creating crucial caches of comparison causing creative creatures to capitalize with commendation and cheer christening ceasation to common characterization of civilizations commonplace cruelty
911087 your courage courses creating crucial caches of comparison causing creative creatures to capitalize with commendation and cheer christening ceasation to common characterization of civilizations commonplace cruelty and so i bow my head to you
911088 oh my gosh this is like my best birthday ever
911089 when i first read the books and saw that it was here i had been here a long time ago and was just so super psyched because it was like i have actually been there
911090 but i think there will be a twist and it will all end in a cliffhanger or something
911091 our house even has a blue room and yellow cabinets like in the book
911092 we have about 120 or 130 people in here a day
911093 not every one of them are twilight fans but the majority are
911094 im really excited to see what happens in the new one

911098 five years have passed since we first called on the ioc to stand up for the workers who make olympics products but it is still business as usual for them once again money is pouring in to the coffers of the olympics movement but the workers who create the wealth are still being ripped off
911099 instead of acting properly on the reports by play fair which gave clear evidence of the labour violations the ioc simply passed the buck to the beijing organizers leaving the root problems unsolved
911100 the ioc is out of sync with the spirit of the olympic movement around the world many organizations and individuals have spoken out on dozens of occasions during the past year about the importance of having the ioc deal with these issues the ioc should be a leader not a laggard
911101 we are just protecting womens rights to take their clothes off
911102 the womens movement is supposed to be about choice and if i choose to quit my job that is my choice
911103 weve agreed to continue to talk and the unions have agreed to continue to work
911104 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
911105 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
911106 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
911107 no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become

911109 smile at your haters show them how pretty your teeth are and if your smile makes them mad enough to try to knock your teeth out you will know you have the power
911110 i just feel that god has something for you to have doves eyes to be uncompromising in your search for his presence
911111 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
911112 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
911113 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
911114 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
911115 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
911116 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
911117 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
911118 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
911119 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
911120 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
911121 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
911122 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
911123 paradoxically as the clinical value of norvir was increasing dramatically its financial value to abbott was declining
911124 for one reason to get more revenue from the sale of norvir
911125 abbotts dec 3 2003 price increase was an attempt to leverage its monopoly position in the boosting market in order to disadvantage competitors and maintain its dominant position in the boosted market
911126 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
911127 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
911128 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
911129 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
911130 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
911131 the same people who sell them today at 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
911132 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments
911133 so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
911134 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
911135 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
911136 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
911137 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
911138 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
911139 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
911140 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
911141 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
911142 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
911143 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
911144 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
911145 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
911146 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
911147 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
911148 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont

911151 not like that but if she would have tried to take me home tonight i would have fucked her tomorrow though now thats another story
911152 its always possible that the wife and husband have decked up garlanded themselves gone to a nearby studio and created a wedding set up
911153 after the divorce the girl came to me and said she wanted to take up a course in voice editing because of what happened to her
911154 sir please dont underestimate my love i had undergone vasectomy before marriage so that i could focus all my attention on her but she talks too much on the phone
911155 we need fathers to recognize that responsibility doesnt just end at conception that doesnt make you a father what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child any fool can have a child that doesnt make you father its the courage to raise a child that makes you a father
911156 girl you dont need another drink damn you look pale lets walk to the sink
911157 this shit happens to everyone i must say but ill tell you what youre the worse of the day

911161 no one can afford to miss the musings of the chatty jancis
911162 this session is on the challenges to selling riesling all other sessions have celebrated riesling
911163 there is a disconnect between the critics experts and wine drinkers we have always promoted riesling and the wine buying public has ignored us now younger drinkers have an interest in riesling but the perception of riesling faces lots of hurdles and challenges
911164 you ought to have plenty to talk about as you both like
911165 what we want is the university students to be associated with the community and the living of the population of which they are a part
911166 this it project will also be using projectors which would be operated from one control center manned by a few instructors in a bid to reach many students
911167 its time that our education system moved away from the tendency of just putting computers in schools but integrating ict into the education policy
911168 we met as cabinet last week and what we observed is that there is too much democracy that is quickly descending into anarchy there is too much freedom in this country and what we are witnessing in schools is just a reflection of the larger society
911169 although clan condemns the mode students have chosen to air their grievances the organisation is however strongly opposed to giving teachers a chance to abuse students through the re introduction of caning
911170 the cabinet has decided and teachers should listen to this let us not have child kings and queens in our schools you spare the rod and spoil the child
911171 if a child does something wrong he or she must be caned as a government we have said discipline has to be enforced in our schools
911172 this mass action thing is a dangerous culture that we have introduced in this country that when you want your grievances addressed you must demand it by some force now it has taken root in our schools
911173 when a child leaves home to go to school the teachers become the next guardians i cannot bail out a teacher who defiles pupils irrespective of whether they are my voters or not
911174 but the problem is that in some cases parents are compromised by accepting money and the offending teachers walk away scot free
911175 although we are carrying out arrests and over 4 000 defilers have been charged we should go an extra mile by bringing the teachers on board through sensitising them
911176 girls from p 5 to p 7 are undergoing adolescence and are therefore adventurous and vibrant because their bodies are undergoing several changes if a teacher does not realise this they end up messing up with these pupils
911177 we are moving around schools telling these children that they can get unwanted pregnancies get sexually transmitted diseases like hiv aids on top of dropping out of school
911178 a teacher is by law not supposed to have any sexual relations with his pupils if they do they are breaking the law and contravening their professional code of conduct
911179 already confirmed cases could be just the tip of an iceberg maybe many people have successfully gone through but the examinations council has the right to nullify results of proven cases
911180 tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states of america

911182 lesbian and gay couples in california will be able to marry on an equal basis starting on june 17
911183 every day public support for the freedom to marry is growing
911184 people will see their friends neighbors and co workers engaging in this very cherished ritual and i believe it will continue to push the california voting public in the direction of assuring that the constitution does not treat people differently
911185 over the last few years aides have winced at repeated tabloid reports about clintons episodic friendship and occasional dinners out with belinda stronach a twice divorced billionaire auto parts heiress and member of the canadian parliament 20 years his junior or at more recent high end hollywood dinner party gossip that clinton has been seen visiting with the actress gina gershon in california

911315 youre up early howd you ride and drink coffee at the same time
911316 i didnt i went in hey did you know there are some really funny people at tims in the morning
911317 there are regulars at every coffee shop but theyre wily you have to go before 4 in the afternoon to catch them
911318 there was this group of old dudes four of them sitting there they were awesome they were reading the obituaries out loud
911319 another guy just sat in the corner drinking his tea and doing a crossword
911320 they invited me to sit with them so i did id been trying to keep an eye on my bike through the window so it wouldnt get stolen so i told them i had to sit at the end of the table
911321 you leave me and your brother in an unlocked house but youre worried about your bike
911322 i sat there with my coffee and bagel and they just read these obituaries and made comments it was hilarious
911323 theyd read one and one of them would say ah he was on the crack
911324 we have a picture in our minds of the power a wild animal possesses and the damage it can do and when we see displays of affection like this another side of the animal it connects with our emotions

911326 that leopard was on exhibit for many years and she always watched me from the moment i came into view til i disappeared over the horizon we had a lasting connection and it was such a thrill
911327 you cant call it conventional but why not it is about who is closest to you not who is the closest woman
911328 manish has always been a really good friend and when i thought about who should be with me at my wedding i thought of him right away it just seemed natural
911329 some people said what dont you have any girlfriends which really surprised me that isnt it at all my sister is my maid of honour and i thought that part of the point of a bridal party is to surround yourself with those people who mean the most to you and offer you emotional support that means manish hes been there for me and with me for a long time i want my wedding day to be full of love to be celebrated with my extended family and hes a big part of that
911330 we did contemplate it but the reason hes part of our lives is that he is such a good friend of mine and so i want him with me on that day
911331 we havent really worked it out yet but i think he will probably be waiting at the altar with the best men just that he will be on my side he wont be walking down the aisle with a bouquet this is our wedding a celebration of our marriage and i dont want it to seem like a mockery
911332 i have always been very close to my brother joel we have always been there for each other during the rough times in life and he is a great friend i have several girlfriends whom i am very close i have four bridesmaids however i have been friends with joel the longest and i really wanted him in the wedding party
911333 i really didnt feel obligated to the tradition of having a female maid of honour so i decided to make joel my man of honour
911334 i decided this a couple of years ago but didnt ask him until after my partner and i were engaged joel said yes right away he was very pleased about being asked and had no issue with being in a traditionally female role
911335 i was with manish at my shower and thought you know it would be so great if my male friends were with me today too its just not really done i guess but i have never thought that a man and woman cant be good friends just because of your gender it doesnt have to always end up like harry and sally
911336 people who do fibre arts like to socialize and get together

911373 er zijn verschillende redenen waarom een filmpje als no longer available geklasseerd wordt
911374 seksueel expliciete beelden kunnen niet ook gewelddadige fragmenten worden eruit gefilterd en dan is er natuurlijk nog het probleem van de rechten alle beelden waar een copyright op rust mogen in principe niet op youtube staan
911375 iedereen kan ons signaleren dat hij de inhoud van een filmpje niet gepast vindt wanneer dat gebeurt neemt ons team het bewuste filmpje onder de loep waarna beslist wordt om het al of niet te verwijderen
911376 daar mag ik geen commentaar op geven cijfermateriaal over het aantal filmpjes dat we censureren geven we niet vrij
911377 zo kan iedereen die in beeld komt ons nu vragen om dat fragment offline te halen
911378 dat gebeurt doelbewust waardoor de kwaliteit van de besluitvorming naar beneden wordt gehaald
911379 zowel op federaal als vlaams niveau zou je verwachten dat een regering de kritiek opzoekt maar die wordt integendeel weggeduwd cd amp v volgt eigenlijk de omgekeerde methode van pakweg een softwarebedrijf dat huurt externen in om de bugs uit hun programmas te halen waardoor die beter worden een beetje meer kritiek zou ook de kwaliteit van de politiek verhogen
911380 neem nu de oosterweelverbinding de besluitvorming daarover wordt in een aparte structuur opgesloten de beheersmaatschappij antwerpen mobiel of bam diezelfde wordt verantwoordelijk gesteld voor de politieke keuzes en moet daarover achteraf verantwoording komen afleggen in het parlement zonder dat het alle correcte informatie geeft maar als er dan iets misloopt trekt de politiek wel zijn paraplu open
911381 de verhouding tussen wetsontwerpen van de regering en wetsvoorstellen van het parlement valt al jarenlang in het nadeel van het parlement uit het parlement is al veel langer zijn macht aan het verliezen maar het gaat over meer dan het parlement alleen ook de media en het middenveld worden uit het debat geweerd
911382 het gaat dan niet eens over goed of slecht bestuur het gaat over de politieke keuzes die ze maken zoals pieter de crem die de langer dan voorzien in afghanistan laat en ze ook ter beschikking van de amerikaans britse operatie enduring freedom wil stellen ik heb daar een ideologisch probleem mee
911383 ik herinner me hoe iemand als wouter beke huisideoloog en ondervoorzitter fl schreef dat christendemocraten altijd het primaat van de politiek hebben afgewezen zij waren de partij die via de verzuiling en het middenveld de dialoog organiseerde daarom is het zo ontgoochelend dat net die partij nu het omgekeerde doet zeker de cd amp v top is helemaal naar de andere kant doorgeslagen

911390 weniger polemik w re jedoch sehr w nschenswert gewesen denn das w rde den inhalt klarer machen au erdem h tten kreationisten dann weniger gelegenheit den text auf rein formaler ebene unter ignorieren des inhalts anzugreifen
911391 so besteht die gefahr dass hier den kreationisten lediglich munition f r propaganda geliefert wird m ssen sie sich doch blo unter dem blichen ignorieren inhaltlicher aspekte bei der hier reichlich zu findenden polemik bedienen schade
911392 allerdings sollten wir in der wortwahl genau diejenige zur ckhaltung ben die unsere kreationistischen gegenspieler vermissen lassen so jedenfalls liefern wir ihnen vorw nde z t berechtigterweise unsere polemik zu kritisieren und dabei den inhalt unserer kritik zu ignorieren was mit absoluter sicherheit passieren wird

911401 but even if they hadnt been ships sensors should have detected the beam in
911402 at least not in any way that you would understand
911403 no insult intended commander i simply mean that the technology involved is beyond the federations grasp at this stage
911404 i believe data that we are still waiting for an explanation why are we here how are you here and what is this all about
911405 tell me captain do you recall the legends of the iconians
911406 an interstelar civilization that vanished two hundred thousand years ago
911407 said to have the ability to appear on distant planets without the aid of starships
911408 the current occupants of the second planet of which i am one have named it turing it has been these last ten years a refuge for androids a planet sized laboratory dedicated to exploring the limits of artificial life but the planet was not chosen by accident the year before i left the federation an archaeological expedition on denius iii unearthed a starmap that appeared to point the way to a forgotten starfaring empire a soong type android with whom i was in communication was on the expedition and alerted me to the findings i was able to identify the markings on the map as iconian in origin and the map then led me here
911409 i can prove it my colleagues and i had reasoned that there might well be a technological basis for the legend about demons of air and darkness and that if there were that technology could be rediscovered and used to aid in our quest
911410 you expect us to believe you found functioning technology from a civilization that vanished nearly a quarter of a million years ago
911411 my presence on the enterprise is proof that we did wesley as is the romulan wardrone rendered inactive by an iconian software virus

911413 data your claims about the iconians and their technology are intriguing to be sure but there are more pressing matters of interest before us such as what you and the rest of the missing androids have been doing out here all this time to say nothing of what you meant when you said that only i could avert a war
911414 it has been a little less than twenty four hours since the romulan wardrone on a routine patrol of the neutral zone chanced upon turing and discovered our presence
911415 but i doubt that raising that objection will much affect the romulans course of action should they discover the existence of turings android population
911416 but the consensus of the turing population was that the wardrone should be incapacitated before it could relay news of that discovery back to romulus it was regrettable since we know that the wardrone is not responsible for its own actions in any pure sense rendered all but a slave by its programming but there was no viable alternative we employed the iconian software virus that was part of the planets original defense system which we disabled and reprogrammed for our purposes shortly after arriving on the planet ten years ago
911417 utilizing a small probe that downloads intrusive code into a targets computer systems once in place the code begins rewriting the computers software impairing operation this particular transfer had been specifically coded for romulan systems and so was able to take out the wardrones communication capabilities in a matter of nanoseconds
911418 but sources within the klingon romulan alliance report that once contact with the wardrone was lost another ship was sent out in search of it which is due to arrive in short order

911481 weve got some momentum going particularly since the prime minister met with president hu hintao at the g8 in japan
911482 i think that the relationship with china is one that weve been cultivating and improving for some time now and my appointment certainly does not get in the way of that but i dont think its a signal of any profound change in foreign policy
911483 emerson is well respected he may well represent the prime ministers voice on this front
911484 as important as he is now as foreign minister probably the most respected senior minister now in all the harper governments but still it is not enough when it comes to china
911485 you need to have the prime ministers direct engagement that is where the key problem is
911486 harper is not committing to visiting china any time soon
911487 why everybody else other heads of state of g8 are visiting china are engaging china for improving chinas human rights for improving economic relations to promote jobs and investments and our prime minister is not doing so
911488 ive believed for a long time in my discussions with the prime minister and he agrees youve got to engage china
911489 weve got issues around human rights rule of law and those kinds of issues youve got to find a way to ensure that we can continue to promote those issues with greatest effect
911490 we have to manage the relationship and thats certainly going to be a top priority for me

911545 i knew we were off so i decided to get in a little extra work
911546 i took a deep breath when ludwick came up because i know hes hot but those are absolutely the situations i want to be in
911547 we got him off his feet and that made him stronger
911548 this was a great way to end a road trip going into a big series against florida
911549 he went right at him about 450 feet worth but he did well he pitched pretty good
911550 if i do it once theyll just expect me to do it again
911551 they had told me they were thinking about giving me a day off so you have to be ready you know youre going to fit in somewhere
911552 ive just got to keep going out there and hoping the team gets a win when i pitch
911553 that teams good man all of them are good hitters if you make a mistake theyll hit it
911554 they were just swinging and i appreciate that it made my job easier
911555 i feel like hes showed us two real good performances in a row now
911556 i knew when i put him in hed come back around to hit
911557 hes hit everything pitches at every location whether its because hes from here and he gets fired up to play us i dont know but hes been very very good against us
911558 i guess i get a little fired up to play these guys
911559 its my hometown team you know everybody back home is watching
911560 it makes me feel like im 15 again with my family coming to see the games
911561 maybe hes more relaxed against these guys because he grew up here
911562 i think hes going to be very serviceable for us
911563 he pitched just like our scouts said he could almost to a t
911564 he commanded everything changed speeds well and made very few mistakes location wise he was just the guy we hoped to see
911565 i was mentally prepared to go five or six innings
911566 with so many young guys they need to hear it from a player

911570 it takes three days to get a jet ski license but akshay explained the time constraints he did a three day course in 12 hours he got up at 6 am and got his license by 7 pm he had to give a written and practical test the action scene we have shot is one of the most expensive ones that bollywood has ever seen and has been directed by danny baldwin
911571 going through a theory and practical exam was like going back to school
911572 when we went for a reccee to australia we saw a lot of show reels and met a lot of technicians but we saw a clear synergy with danny as his style of action was exactly what we needed the beauty about the action in singh is kinng is that not only is it great to look at but makes the audience laugh as well
911573 it is similar only in quality these are very high end action sequences akshay had to be very careful in certain sequences for instance the scene in which he had to jump from one moving lift to another without supporting cables but akshay is akshay he did it with much panache and agility enjoy watching it in the film

911575 i usually dont look for anything i usually try and react
911576 he threw a couple fastballs a couple change ups he left the fastball over the plate and i got the barrel to it
911577 he threw strikes was very aggressive going after hitters and looked very poised and under control to me
911578 but whether or not well call him up is something we cant discuss publicly we would need a reason to bring him but there is no question he has major league stuff
911579 carrasco has had major league stuff since he was 19 but well evaluate him like we would any pitcher well need him to be more consistent in the strike zone like he was tonight we want him to grow more mature more i like the maturity hes shown tonight i think carrasco will create his own timetable to get to the majors hell let us know when hes ready and when his time will come were willing to be patient and see if he can get major league hitters out consistently
911580 this is the best and healthiest ive been this year
911581 this is definitely the hardest i threw this season i havent thrown 96 until today i feel more mature i want to stay here and get more experience i want to do my job
911582 i just saw ruben outside the clubhouse after the game
911583 but i was having a little tenderness in my right shoulder about 3 weeks ago it bothered the way i threw but i felt great tonight its the best velocity i had this season
911584 whether thats in september or not well see but were pretty pleased with our starters now so i dont know where hell fit
911585 but he showed me tonight three major league pitches with an occasional slider and was consistent with them all
911586 it was a crazy ballgame but it was a big win

911607 it is the view of the association that members need not honour do not call requests that originate from the organization in question
911608 all telemarketers to maintain internal do not call lists and to abide by consumers requests to not be called
911609 there is no prohibition on consumers making such a request through a third party
911610 a consumer can make a do not call request to an organization even though the consumer does not have an existing business relationship with that organization
911611 to the extent that these requests are sent to organizations that engage in telemarketing and that are therefore subject to the rules regarding do not call lists these requests would be in compliance with the act and the current unsolicited telecommunications rules as outlined above in short on the basis of the facts as i understand them and have stated above i consider that do not call requests made through ioptout are valid and should be honoured

911641 durch die neuen personalien zeigt fukuda seine entschlossenheit das staatsdefizit zu senken
911642 underpricing a home to create an auction like frenzy started on really great homes in nice neighbourhoods
911643 now everyone is doing it on any old piece of crap
911644 theres no way my client was going to get that home for anywhere near the listing price
911645 even if i was the only buyer they still wouldnt have sold me the house which is ludicrous
911646 i was at one listing recently where there were 19 bids on one property thats 19 people who have to call their mortgage broker maybe get a house inspection take time off work and pay for babysitters
911647 the problem with listings today is that the list price means nothing
911648 the truth is it may be listed at a pickering price
911649 you might see a lot of agents with egg on their faces if they try and create an auction and nobody shows up
911650 it is the lazy agents way of having to deal with a listing for only seven days
911651 its detrimental to the seller you might have 19 bids but only two people can really afford the house because youve attracted everyone else who cant with a lower listing so its completely artificial
911652 and of course the house is going to sell over asking because its underpriced in the first place
911653 it doesnt work for every neighbourhood but if you have a popular area you can generate more interest in the property
911654 auctions bidding wars and the various ways of marketing properties are driven by the marketplace
911655 treb and others do not have the right to interfere with a market driven function
911656 the rule should read that the listing should be immediately available for presentation of offers as well
911657 that would end up stopping the one day auction mentality that agents try to create
911658 whatever happened to the old method of doing a proper appraisal listing it at 2 to 5 per cent above market value open a listing up for showings and taking offers as soon as they come in its much fairer for the buyers opens up the sellers to get the best possible price and takes the false hype out of the marketplace
911659 i just got sick of playing their game and feeling manipulated
911660 i just didnt even bother looking at a lot of the properties because of that

911667 diese siegerehrung werde ich so schnell nicht vergessen als wir das podium verlassen wollten war pl tzlich die t r verschlossen und wir konnten nicht mehr raus meinen ersten sieg wollte ich nat rlich genie en aber nicht eingesperrt auf dem podium zum gl ck kam schnell jemand und lie uns raus mein rennen lief gut beim start fuhr ich gut weg und die ersten runden war ich richtig schnell unterwegs dann sah ich das safety car und dachte oh nein nach dem restart konnte ich zwar in f hrung bleiben aber marco machte richtig druck auf der strecke lag viel schmutz und ein kleiner fahrfehler h tte mich beinahe platz eins gekostet marco versuchte anzugreifen blieb aber fair sonst w ren wir beide abgeflogen
911668 mein start lief nicht so gut ich verlor zwei pl tze nach der safety car phase lag ich hinter daniel ich versuchte ihn unter druck zu setzen und tats chlich machte er drei runden vor schluss einen kleinen fehler doch ein berholman ver war in der situation zu riskant ich dachte an die wichtigen punkte um in der gesamtwertung auf esteban und adrien aufzuschlie en
911669 von startplatz acht konnte ich gleich zu beginn auf position f nf vorfahren ich war schnell und wollte marco vor mir berholen aber wegen der gelben flaggen ging das nicht als ich nach dem vorfall zwischen adrien und esteban pl tzlich auf position drei lag freute ich mich das rennen war sehr gut aber auch schwierig ich fahre das erste jahr in einem formel bmw und die podiumsanw rter esteban adrien und marco absolvieren alle ihr zweites jahr in der serie umso mehr freue ich mich ber meinen erfolg

911757 if we are going to overhaul the uk games rating system with child safety fully in mind we should be finding a solution that works not only today but also for the future both on and off line

911759 that solution we believe is pegi to this end the games industry will continue to provide the dcms with the evidence to support our case for pegi we are very happy for pegi to be legally reinforced in the uk via the video recordings act

911766 from the time we stopped using these coins i decided to keep them at home i didnt even think of throwing them away
911767 for the past two days they have been looking for the coins and some have been lucky to find them
911768 i believe that most of these coins were thrown away by our parents but now that they have been reintroduced i will continue to search for them
911769 the public should be very wary of such people who are tempted to take advantage of the situation we will not hesitate to arrest anyone involved in such practices
911770 for now we have run out of cash and people will have to wait until we get our next delivery
911771 why should we be treated like this where the system is working we are being referred to our branches but i cant go to bulawayo to withdraw my cash
911772 its has really been difficult for us to access our cash today this is what usually happens when the daily withdrawal is increased rbz should have given these banks some money on time
911773 we are frustrated at the way the bank is conducting its business we have been here since 8am but they are saying there is no cash
911774 while we appreciate the increase in the withdrawal limit we feel that the treatment we are receiving is unjustified
911775 all along people have not been withdrawing their cash from banks because 100 billion was not enough to cover transport fares to and from town so people did not find a reason to withdraw their cash
911776 this reason explains why there is an influx of people at many banks because many people are still to withdraw their salaries
911777 abc holdings has been impressed with the way the current psl leadership has worked hard to make our football a success
911778 and we at abc holdings have felt that its now time to support the psl by investing in soccer as part of our broad social responsibility programme as well as bringing awareness to the public of our expansion into retail banking
911779 in a way we are coming in to complement the sterling efforts of the existing sponsors who continue to support the development of soccer in this country
911780 our sponsorship is but small considering the level of our soccer and where it has come from through the efforts of these sponsors
911781 the teams that will be participating in the showdown are the top eight teams based on the final league standings of the 2007 premier soccer league season
911782 we believe that these teams deserve recognition for the achievement they made and the passion with which they carried themselves in the gruelling soccer season last year
911783 the abc super 8 soccer showdown will carry prize money of z 66 9 quadrillion old money or z 6 690 000 six million six hundred and ninety thousand dollars in redenominated money
911784 the tournament will also be unique in that for the first time in zimbabwean soccer the prize money will be innovatively invested and hedged against diminution in real value by the capable abc asset management who have been consistently voted the top fund manager in the last four years and treasury teams and will thus keep pace with developments in the economy
911785 we will through our top performing fund managers abc asset management periodically over the tournament advise the football fraternity and the country at large including all the current and future banking clients of abc of the prize value of the abc super8 soccer showdown
911786 as part of the bank the psl and sup8r football teams corporate and social investment programmes 10 percent of the net gate takings will be reserved for selected charities
911787 we are in no doubt that the showdown will become an exciting fixture on our football calendar and in this respect psl teams have to work hard to finish in the top eight and take part in this lucrative showdown
911788 on behalf of the abc family i would like to thank all who have been involved in the organisation of the showdown and specifically the psl and zifa for affording the bank to play a role in the development of soccer in the country
911789 there has been a vast improvement but it looks as though the game has come too quickly for him
911790 its a big test for us early in the season and its a game that we need to get a result in if we want to play european football its as simple as that

911792 we had a superb run in europe last season and we know whats at stake this time so lets get on with it
911793 it was only a friendly and it was against one of the best sides in europe

911870 traditionally dentistry is indeed very wasteful and the reason why society generally doesnt think of it as such is because its not spewing sludge and smoke
911871 but what you dont see is really what adds up

911896 from the industrys standpoint we would not agree to and would not support another fta which came with those features or those arrangements
911897 there needs to be something in it for the local manufacturers
911898 the ftas in place have led to trade distortions and components substitution away from australia thereby discouraging production in australia
911899 for example as there is no duty on imported components from thailand it is cheaper for car makers to import fully built components and modules than it is to import components and assemble modules here

912000 ich bin mit dem heutigen rennen zufrieden leider habe ich einen schlechten start erwischt und hatte daher keine chance gegen damien w hrend des rennens konnte ich sein tempo mitgehen doch da war es bereits zu sp t sein sieg ist jedoch verdient er war das gesamte wochenende sehr stark heute w re es schwer gewesen ihn zu schlagen aufgrund des meisterschaftsstandes wollte ich kein zu hohes risiko eingehen nun liege ich mit 38 punkten vorsprung an der spitze das gibt sicherheit ab jetzt werde ich daher wieder st rker angreifen und versuchen noch den einen oder anderen laufsiege zu holen
912001 der dritte platz war der erste podiumserfolg f r irwin in der aktuellen saison wir haben wirklich sehr sehr lange darauf hingearbeitet insbesondere david hat in den letzten rennen sehr hart um eine platzierung auf dem treppchen gek mpft er hatte pech und ich hatte heute das gl ck diesen dritten platz zu holen budapest geh rt zu meinen absoluten lieblingsstrecken schon in den letzten jahren bin ich hier immer sehr gut unterwegs gewesen heute war mir klar dass ich am start sehr gut wegkommen muss um eine chance zu haben das ist mir gelungen und danach konnte ich den dritten platz relativ einfach ins ziel bringen f r den rest des jahres w nsche ich mir noch ein paar podiumserfolge f r unser team vielleicht ist ja jetzt der knoten geplatzt
912002 mein start war alles andere als optimal ich habe gezuckt und bin dann auf die bremse danach war ein guter start nicht mehr m glich im rennen bin ich dann ganz gut unterwegs gewesen hinten hat mir lance viel druck gemacht jedoch konnte ich gut damit umgehen und nach vorne war ich mit dem david saelens besch ftigt es war kein langweiliges rennen sondern vielmehr ein sehr lehrreiches

912015 this was a great week in the house of representatives for the children of america
912016 over the last eight years the key federal agencies responsible for protecting the public health have been muzzled
912017 when the science says that products that babies put into their mouths could be a threat to their health the safety commission is supposed to act but they did nothing
912018 too often our watchdog agencies have been captured by special interests and the people put in charge have been republican cronies who have had little experience or interest in their government duties remember fema and hurricane katrina
912019 but this week congress said the public interest must come first
912020 we also finally stood up to the tobacco companies fourteen years ago i chaired the hearings at which the tobacco company ceos swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive cigarettes did not cause disease and they did not target our children well they of course lied
912021 when the republicans took control of the congress in the next year and controlled it for the next 12 years efforts on tobacco were stopped
912022 but last year democrats regained the majority in the house and house speaker nancy pelosi made taking on the tobacco companies a top priority and this week we achieved an important milestone
912023 with strong bipartisan support we passed long overdue legislation to stop advertising and promotions targeted to our kids to stop the marketing of candy flavored cigarettes clearly designed to attract our kids to smoking to give the fda the power to both regulate marketing and the manufacture of tobacco products to make sure that we can remove dangerous additives like formaldehyde and ammonia and begin the process of figuring out how to make cigarettes less addictive
912024 tobacco is the only product that when its used as intended kills every day 1 000 kids take up this deadly habit and each year over 400 000 americans die from smoking
912025 i am proud to say that the house has finally passed legislation to protect our children from tobacco addiction and its devastating toll of death and disease
912026 we are in the final months of president bushs last term but through our legislative efforts we are giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
912027 government at its best can work it was a very good week for the american public and best of all it was a very good week for our kids
912028 today we learned that 51 000 jobs were lost last month the seventh straight month of job loss now totaling 463 00 jobs lost since the beginning of this year ive already called for an economic stimulus package on two different occasions this year and much of what ive proposed has passed in congress these efforts have made some difference but with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
912029 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track the first part of my plan is a 1 000 emergency energy rebate that could go out to families as soon as this fall this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next 4 months or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt as we provide relief we must also be mindful of the swelling budget deficit that is why i am proposing that we pay for this rebate by taxing the windfall profits of oil companies so we can use some of their record profits to help families pay record prices
912030 the second part of my plan is a 50 billion stimulus to help jump start job creation and help local communities that are struggling due to our economic downturn half of this stimulus will go to state governments that are facing big budget shortfalls the other half of this stimulus will be used to invest in our national infrastructure replenish the highway trust fund rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges and repair our crumbling schools
912031 todays jobs report is an urgent reminder that we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what senator mccain is offering hes proposing to cut the gasoline tax paid by the oil companies and trust that they will pass on the savings in the form of lower prices at the pump and hes also proposing tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans in the hopes that a little bit of it will trickle down to ordinary americans i do not believe that giving 4 billion in new tax cuts to oil companies will create any jobs or save you any money i believe that if we want relief for families we should give relief to families not oil companies if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans not boost the profits of oil companies its time to restore fairness and balance to our economy and we can start by passing the emergency economic plan that im proposing today
912032 for too long partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the american people and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis
912033 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
912034 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
912035 but ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning in the coming days ill be laying out additional steps i believe we must take to bring down gas prices for good and truly free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
912036 perhaps the only thing more outrageous than exxon mobil making record profits while americans are paying record prices at the pump is the fact that senator mccain has proposed giving them an additional 1 2 billion tax break while senator mccains plan has succeeded in helping his campaign raise over 1 million from oil and gas company executives and employees just last month it wont lower gas prices or end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil instead of an energy policy that reads like an oil company wish list its time to create a new american energy economy by investing in alternative energy creating millions of new jobs increasing fuel efficiency standards and ending the tyranny of oil once and for all

912060 if people are going to build homes where hurricanes hit they have to assume a great part of that liability
912061 mccain also faced criticism for opposing a national catastrophic insurance fund for hurricane prone states democrats noted that crist who gave mccain a critical boost by endorsing him just before the florida primary last january had lobbied congress for the fund his predecessor as governor jeb bush also backed the fun mccain has said he would instead bring industry and government together to protect homeowners his spokesman tucker bounds said thursday that the government run fund would ignore the need for reforms of the private insurance market to make sure everyone can get coverage
912062 is resisting calls to back the program this is a very large federal program and the only state currently in a position to benefit is florida said douglas holtz eakin mr mccains policy director mr mccain who opposed the federal catastrophe plan received 690 000 from individuals in the insurance industry 9 000 from allstate employees and 21 000 from employees of state farm
912063 the bush administration said wednesday it opposes a national catastrophic insurance fund even as gov
912064 the administrations uncompromising opposition is disappointing the creation of an emergency fund deserves a hearing in congress and the president need not get in the way

912066 the work of the florida state legislature has begun to address the insurance crisis in our state but federal action is also necessary i implore congress to take the next step to ensure the affordability and availability of property insurance a federal catastrophe fund would provide protection for american homeowners throughout the nation a national program would spread the risk across the country thus strengthening our insurance markets capital for the plan could come from a portion of the property insurance premiums already collected by insurance companies the funds could grow tax free provide the financial capability to cope with the catastrophic risk and allow affected regions the ability to recover more quickly from natural disasters this federal backstop for insurers is an essential step to addressing the insurance crisis
912067 the bush administration said wednesday it opposes a national catastrophic insurance fund even as gov
912068 but while mr crist a republican and the republican dominated legislature said last week that they were committed to significant across the board rate reductions reality proved more complicated south floridians covered by the state run insurer of last resort because private companies refuse to insure their homes will see the smallest savings as little as 8 percent their insurance costs have as much as tripled since 2004 forcing many people to consider leaving florida

912070 on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook mr mccain used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics which killed his own 2000 presidential bid but he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day to day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of mr rove and gave top positions to two others the r sum s of the new teams members included stints in mr bushs white house and in his 2004 re election campaign one of the most negative and divisive in memory
912071 the old happy warrior side of mr mccain has been eclipsed a bit lately by a much more aggressive and more negative mr mccain who hammers mr obama repeatedly on policy differences experience and trustworthiness
912072 mr mccain is clearly trying to sow doubts about his younger opponent and bring him down a peg or two but some republicans worry that by going negative so early and initiating so many of the attacks himself rather than leaving them to others mr mccain risks coming across as angry or partisan in a way that could turn off some independents who have been attracted by his calls for respectful campaigning
912073 on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
912074 listen nobody denies hes one of the smartest political minds in america id be glad to get his advice i get advice from a lot of people id be happy to have his advice he beat me i certainly would be glad to get his advice i dont think id want to revisit how he did it and i mean that i mean that i dont feel like reliving my defeat
912075 ive always respected karl rove as one of the great smart political minds in american politics ive always respected him we never had any ill will after the initial south carolina thing after we had the meeting with president bush we moved on ive seen karl rove many times when ive been over at the white house weve always had pleasant conversations its not so much whether i approve of his tactics or not its that he had a very good great political mind and any information or advice and counsel he can give us id be glad to have i dont think anybody denies his talents so id be glad to get any advice and council we would obviously decide whether to accept it or not

912083 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
912084 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
912085 we should ask those who make profits out of reveling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
912086 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
912087 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
912088 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking

912103 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate

912105 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage

912112 weve seen job ads fall for three consecutive months which points to further softness in the labour market in coming months
912113 its a combination of higher interest rates and the economy needing to slow to remove inflationary pressures from the system
912114 importantly the developing weakness in labour demand likely to become clearer in the official jobs data over coming months is most apparent in the former boom state of queensland with its resource rich sister state western australia not far behind

912150 he took out a big can of pepper spray and sprayed the whole can in my face all i saw was a big bulk of red stuff coming toward me like sand and he ran for the door
912151 its like needles this burning feeling the eyes just burned all i could do was put cold water on it
912152 we do log peoples names for the basic reason that if they use it illegally and if the police come by and want to know if they bought pepper spray we tell them
912153 it didnt even cross our minds that people would use it for anything else
912154 i think it would be naive for any intelligent person to think that people are buying bear spray for bears
912155 they have to make sure a person understands why they are buying it what they plan to use it for and also have to make sure that they advise the purchaser that if you use it for any other purpose then you are using an offensive weapon
912156 we still have access to it we just dont want to have quick access to it here for someone who is just buying it as a lark
912157 ever since it became available in halifax there were increases in the abuse of bear spray so kids were using it in the street it wasnt the bears who were getting hurt it was the people who were getting hurt so we decided here not to carry it
912158 what would have happened if i hadnt turned back and he had attacked me
912159 they could be charged with assault with a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon
912160 the hands got a lot of pepper spray in em
912161 theyve swelled up and they burn so every few minutes i dip my hands in the cold water
912162 i dont think anyones going to stop it theyre selling it as a bear spray not as a weapon so hunters will buy it

912213 it is not in our policy to have a referendum on mmp if it aint broke dont fix it is the usual formula and it isnt broke
912214 what the national party really want is unfettered power they dont like the thought of having to share power with other parties
912215 now ive been in the position as prime minister for close to nine years where we have shared power with other parties and by and large ive come to the conclusion that is not a bad thing
912216 i think the country may well vote mmp out but i think they will vote in another proportional system
912217 its two quite specific areas and when you see them the way that we are funding the tax cut programme it is very clear and its not ambiguous
912218 everyone knows where the labour led government stands on the issues that matters there are no hidden agendas
912219 you will be in a position where nationals tax cut programme effectively when combined with our changes will be the same cost as labours
912220 any argument that national is borrowing for tax cuts well if that was the case then labours borrowing for tax cuts

912229 it may be that he should be facing the people he gave commitments to last year when he committed to holding elections by march 2009
912230 he has made public statements since the group visited fiji that he never intended to have them and that he intends changing electoral law before an election

912232 i dont think you can expect that to be on the agenda i wouldnt jump to any conclusions
912233 privatisation is in the national partys dna so it is simply not believable for them to say they would not privatise key assets like kiwibank and you could probably add to that kiwirail the share in air new zealand electricity soes and another long list of state assets

912237 traditionally social services for people living with hiv were set up by and for gay men
912238 up until fairly recently the vast majority of begins service users were gay men
912239 but in the past five years thats changed dramatically and now the majority are african women who are often asylum seekers or refugees
912240 i hide my hiv status from my neighbours but unfortunately some people around where i live found hiv magazines in my dustbin and stuck them on my door
912241 l had to hide in my flat for quite some time until begin helped me out
912242 i still feel very lonely and keep my windows closed there are people who call me names but you get used to it
912243 with hiv related problems you cant always discuss them with your doctor or your family here you can have non judgemental conversations with staff and other service users
912244 therell be young women and young men out there who are straight and who have hiv
912245 this will be a chance to get together and be on the same wavelength
912246 there is still an epidemic amongst gay men and there is an imported epidemic amongst african people in the uk but those groups arent always distinct
912247 we know for example that african men are over represented amongst homosexually acquired hiv infection so there are often crossovers in infection but thats not often talked about

912269 its not right for us to comment on how people take pinoy idol now siguro the most i can say is that uh the same respect the people gave us when we were doing our version of philippine idol i will give the creators of pinoy idol now siguro hindi tamang mag comment ako ill keep my thoughts to myself pero may ano may pagmamahal ako para sa show na yun
912270 no it was never i dont think it was ever an option thats why i was the last one to find out that gma is doing
912271 then he was the one who told me na definitely well we dont have the season 2 and then when i talked to miss annette gozon abrogar vp for program management last year it was really never in the table na ang philippine idol their version was gonna be for me never napag usapan thats why na open up yung possibility of me hosting pinoy dream academy
912272 ah ako nung time na yon of course why not kasi kunyari
912273 alam ni tita cory vidanes abs cbn head for tv production yon
912274 i was very vocal na hindi ako bitter hindi talaga para sa akin e
912275 kasi itong six months nga na pinagdaanan ko na walang show e nakaka praning yun di ba
912276 hindi yun it gave me time to spend with judy ann santos it gave me time to finish my book di ba it give me time to plan my proposal so everything was falling into place for me so thankful ako
912277 ayun na the moment i got home from the states nung gabing yon na nabigay yun natuwa ako kasi sa akin resigned na ako na hindi ko makukuha yung fear factor talaga i was just really looking forward to coming back
912278 because i knew i screwed up the audition i wasnt able to give my best in the audition
912279 hindi ko alam kung sino wala akong nakasabay but you have to think my ten years of hosting dito sa pilipinas the people from endemol owners of fear factor and academy franchise really dont give a damn about it they just want to see you hindi tayo kilala niyan e yung audition tape lang talaga ang basehan nila hindi nila concern kung sino ka man wala e same thing with philippine idol
912280 oh yeah definitely to be honest i was resigned about
912281 yung pieta nga very apologetic ako kina enrico santos we were supposed to do august and ah dumating yung fear factor thankful ako na theyre open to moving the taping to september that was a bit of a concern but i mean im thankful that enrico pushed the taping schedule back
912282 yeah well you know its interesting to watch na ang action stars ngayon sa u s hindi na sina arnold schwarzenegger at sylvester stallone its the revenge of the nerds he he he
912283 kaya nagpapasalamat ako na sina enrico they are willing to take that risk somebody who didnt have the macho image as long as the role and the interpretation is right they are willing to give a shot so medyo doon din ako sinuwerte nung binigay ang pieta
912284 yeah sa europe araw araw ako halos tumakbo and then even in the states halos araw araw din akong tumakbo and then dito yung execise regimen ko almost every day
912285 nakakatuwa nga e dahil di ba usually kapag bakasyon bumibigat pag uwi ko from europe and from the states gumaan ako so nagwo work naman yung exercise
912286 huwag na para akong nagbubuhat ng bangko ko e ha ha ha
912287 o sige na well they told me they like my maturity level sa hosting kasi nung naisip ko nga oo nga pala no ten years na nga pala akong nagho host im not a host anymore marami na akong pinagdaanang trials sa iba ibang shows
912288 ah no no no the opposite of it if you feel like the host doesnt need a script anymore it only means the writer is doing a very good job kasi ako i always credit it sa mga writers ko na if im working with a good writer then im a very good host otherwise its really gonna be a tough time kasi ano lang naman yan e yung hosting nakikita mo pero yung nagsulat importante kasi like ako experience ko with some of the really good writers that ive worked with theyre able to second how im gonna speak i dont have to adapt to their speaking style its the writer really who sees kung paano ako nagsasalita so lilinawin na nila yung thoughts sa pagbasa ko ng script parang seamless na
912289 im realy more scared about the psychological impact that will happen mag isa ako sa argentina where pinoy fear factor will be shot although kasama ko sina direk lauren dyogi its gonna be a boys club kasi isang buwan mahigit e
912290 dahil sa layo ng south america even if she takes a leave for a week that will take her two days to go and two days to comeback so she only has solid three days oh two and half pa nga depende kung ano so hindi siguro
912291 to be honest i was resigned about fear factor alam ko ang uuwian ko na lang dito sa pilipinas that time was that show from abc 5 and my show pieta yun ang pinaghahandaan ko e sinuwerte lang talaga

912321 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
912322 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
912323 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
912324 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that

912332 these findings clearly identify the kinds of hiv prevention that are most needed by african people living in england
912333 having detailed information about which africans need the most support will help the organisations which fund and deliver services to better target their scarce resources
912334 the report re affirms the importance of making hiv testing services treatment and information easily available and accessible
912335 less than one third of people living in low and middle income countries who need life saving hiv treatment have access to it and it makes sense that people will be influenced by their experiences in their countries of origin

912407 have you heard the stories about dr t he is someone to stay away from
912408 he is a womanizer he has been to the disciplinary committee many times but nothing happens you still see him around
912409 i hear he just asked some chick out she refused and he told her outright hell fail her
912410 there is a fellow lecturer who was dissing him indirectly saying he knows some lecturers who might be carriers and they have even been to the disciplinary committee
912411 you arent serious how come you didnt tell us this before
912412 he used to go after this chick in 3rd year now when she refused his advances he failed her plus her boyfriend who was in the same class he usually goes after many chicks at the same time
912413 huh that office si he shares the office with another lecturer omg
912414 i was told the way to deal with it is not to act a mjuaji but also not to act coy just take him around in circles besides you are lucky the semester has come to a close

912426 it is with deep sorrow that the nigerian guild of editors nge received the news of the death of the doyen of nigerian journalists alhaji babatunde jose which occured in the morning of saturday august 3 2008 at the age of 82
912427 without doubt the guild like the entire nigerian media will miss the exemplary leadership and direction that jose provided for the nigerian press
912428 the development of the three games was started at the same time and we gathered to try and find a common platform to stand on and try to build from but since then weve been working completely independently of each other each game is evolving in its own direction and take place in separate worlds with their own main characters there exists basically no cooperation between the different teams i wouldnt even want to claim that we communicate with each other
912429 the only similarity between the games that you can find is in the vague crystal theme
912430 we took the futuristic theme to its limit ffxiii will truly define the term futurism youve never seen anything like it
912431 theres been times when ive wanted to take ff in a completely different direction than the games producer has wanted im not saying that his or mine opinions have been right or wrong just different one thing ive always wanted to explore deeper is human emotions by going in that direction you risk to make the target group for the game narrower and ff is appreciated by a very large audience but with versus xiii it feels like the right time to take that risk since the script isnt done yet i still dont know exactly how far i dare to go but i know i want to squeeze humanity out of these characters i want versus to feel in the entire body
912432 the journalism profession and we lovers of the profession as well as all nigerians have lost a rare gem his death has created a vacuum that will be difficult to fill
912433 if youre hankering for a virtual fistfight top quality options about the virtua fighter tekken and dead or alive franchises all offer satisfying punch up action but if youre truly looking to give your opponent something to cry about its all about wielding sharpened steel and nothing beats namco bandais soul calibur series for weapon based fighting thrills in our world exclusive preview well reveal the future direction of this beloved series

912437 i started the ico project ueda san joined my team in japan as a cinematic animator but he created a short movie and presented it to me and said i want to make this game
912438 i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game we have to have experienced people do it so it took a while recruiting one person at a time and because fumito ueda doesnt compromise we had to move the development from psone to playstation 2 then i couldnt complete the game because i moved to the united states
912439 it took four years and the second game took four years too so i started calling them the olympic team
912440 they havent released a ps3 title yet of course not theyll take four years but they have something really really good on the way

912468 our music has always been somewhat autobiographical reflecting our own experiences at the time
912469 our first three albums are like mini time capsules in retrospect vietnam was still raging and a lot of social unrest
912470 tom and i were traveling all over the heartland and especially in the south we pretty much were living easy rider cause here we were a couple of guys wearing nehru shirts beads and you didnt see a whole lot of that in those days we really did have to pick and choose where we stopped to get something to eat or check into a motel or get gas
912471 we do not rule out introducing presumed consent in wales at some point in the future
912472 however we do not believe that it is currently the most urgent priority and believe that it could be a distraction from other more productive actions
912473 asking grieving people for their consent to remove part of their loved ones even if it is to save the life of another is not an easy task
912474 so i can see the attraction of presumed consent unfortunately whatever its attractions its not a silver bullet
912475 we feel the committee has missed a real opportunity for wales to take the lead and send a clear message to the rest of the uk that a soft system of presumed consent would increase donation rates and save welsh lives
912476 quite simply people are dying on these waiting lists we have the opportunity to change that by simply changing our approach
912477 there is no doubt that a system of presumed consent would produce a far higher potential donor rate than at present which is far too low at 22

912482 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
912483 we are honored that a patriot of senator mccains stature would take time during his presidential campaign to help us honor our veterans and active duty military personnel
912484 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every person s vote today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
912485 oh now you want to count all the delegates in fl amp mi you sure are arrogant
912486 this is one of the slimiest things hes done and that is saying a lot
912487 obama is now telling us that those delegates should count in full now that it wont count toward who will win the nomination since he has been crowned
912488 so now he is the ruler of the dnc rules committee as well so even though they were doing his bidding he now throws them under the bus i hope he gives back those votes in michigan that were never cast for him obama is the worst candidate the dems could have put forth he is the most politically expedient flip flopper i have ever seen in my lifetime please superdelegates give us hillary at the convention hillary 08
912489 all i can say is i watched the whole dnc rules committee hearing on that saturday this is like asking the rape victim to fall in love with the attacker
912490 illegitimate candidate now wants legitimacy and validation i guess those pesky poll numbers can sober anyone up i guess da rulz dont matter anymore
912491 hillary suspended her campaign she never conceded she hasnt released her delegates she is the real nominee of this party and they better own up to it obama can not be trusted he is a empty suit now there will be a fight on the convention floor this is a whole new ball game dnc wake up and stop drinking the kool aide you have a winning nominee senator hillary rodham clinton super delegates wake up with obama you lose he is tanking he tried the race card against mc cain and it backfired now he wants michigan and desperate even he knows he cant win give hillary the nomination which she won or lose big time in november and risk losing the voters of the democratic party without them you have no party the party will be over the last one to leave turn the lights out

912501 it is doubtful that any one single event no matter how global iconic and well executed can succeed in healing such deep historical wounds
912502 the games are very short but what is left behind will last
912503 im proud of the guys for sticking in there even when we went down in the second half we stuck with it i think we did a great job in sticking together in front of a large crowd
912504 obviously its my first game in three years with the earthquakes its not a bad way to start hopefully i can bring in more goals
912505 and i knew it was one on one and i just got by them i was looking to pass it to scott sealy but he got blocked off so i took the ball to the corner and it worked
912506 he has done it all through his career hes a quick player and when hes got confidence like he does at the moment he scores goals which gives any team problems
912507 their confidence is a lot higher than when we played last time
912508 and our confidence is slightly lower than when we played them last they played well today
912509 those people who make a living out of short selling stocks are bordering on criminality
912510 those stock market players who have no interest in the company who spread or propagate rumours that they havent been bothered to check and then sell into the back of those rumours i dont think theyre doing anyone any good
912511 and of course when we hear that weve got cracks in the bottom of our ore cars or even a ship has sunk at the berth
912512 we know those things are being put out to scare the mums and dads into selling their shares and of course the people whove shorted their shares then go and buy those shares off
912513 the investment banks who defend short selling are defending real personal interest
912514 were very happy to sign deals on rail but when it comes to the port
912515 this has been very challenging to ramp up its also been very successful and until were sure of that capacity we arent going to rush in too early to also treat other peoples ore
912516 but if you want to get on our railway line and have a port to take it out of you can do it immediately
912517 nonetheless were going to do whatever it takes to also ship other peoples iron ore through our port as well
912518 weve cast our reputation on the forge of doing what weve said we were going to do
912519 thirty billion us dollars is a conservative number for what wed make
912520 the railways lines are the arteries to open up the pilbara
912521 all im asking for in opening up the pilbara is lets do it together
912522 you slowly increase the heat until it becomes impossible to survive
912523 this is the kind of project that continues to be put off and its really unfortunate because a library is a really important resource
912524 theres a lot of work to be done between speculation and reality
912525 we think of municipal infrastructure and we think of sporting facilities and we think of roads and sewers and all those things that we put millions and millions of dollars into and this is kind of the intellectual capital of our community
912526 its one of those things that its sometimes difficult for people to get their heads around because its what you would consider a softer municipal service so to speak because its not a typical nuts and bolts thing but i think theyre equally important and we desperately need a new library
912527 all of the taxpayers are going to be asked to pay for this and im just not so sure that everybody is going to get as much use out of the proposed library as the consultant is putting forward
912528 i just dont want to see us put all our eggs in one basket and start centralizing services in a municipality where every day we preach about decentralization
912529 and here we are talking about spending 42 million to replace a building and a service that already exists i think id rather see us do a little better job in some of the other areas out in the greater community before we start talking about this grandiose effort in the core
912530 we approved money to do some repairs and upgrades to the building and i would hate to think that it was good money after bad so id like to see us patch up what we have and tighten our purse strings a little bit in that particular library and decentralize some of our efforts to better serve some of the other communities instead of just the peninsula
912531 once labour starts talking seriously about a programme for the future this will have the effect of flushing out the conservatives who still seem to believe that they can tiptoe into downing street without telling anybody what they are really thinking with the result of course that many voters still believe that they are not thinking much of anything
912532 does the second doctor story tomb of the cybermen deserve such a stellar reputation should i believe all the hype
912533 a clear sign that inflationary pressure will continue at least in the short term
912534 with the economy expected to slow further at least in the short term businesses need to be particularly diligent about managing their operations to ensure they remain financially stable throughout the challenging conditions
912535 dalam banyak pertemuan jika dia ingin mempertahankan seorang pemain maka dia akan melakukan semuanya dan dia kemungkinan besar selalu berhasil
912536 apa yang dia lakukan hanya untuk kepentingan manchester united hanya itu yang selalu dia pikirkan
912537 tak ada klub yang lebih besar dari mu dan ini benar apakah ronaldo akan bertahan di united saya pikir demikian
912538 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
912539 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
912540 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
912541 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
912542 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
912543 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
912544 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
912545 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
912546 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
912547 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
912548 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
912549 from what we see he should be pitching another 10 years
912550 he really shuts us down we try to figure him out but he throws his glove out there and we have a tough time
912551 theyve got some good young pitching theyve got guys who can frickin fire it with the best of them
912552 i grew up watching the guy pitch and hes probably the best pitcher of my era
912553 to get a chance to throw against the guy ill look back on it as something i enjoyed i didnt expect to give up an rbi single to him though
912554 he makes batters do what he wants them to do luckily hes not throwing in the 90s anymore
912555 financial abuse of seniors is one of the most important issues in canada today
912556 the problem is that cases can be very difficult to bring before the private bar its not that people dont want to but if you dont have any money to retain a lawyer its hard to get someone to go after your funds
912557 i have no doubt but that robert hood harboured a deep suspicion that unless he acted his funds would find their way to his wifes family by her first marriage
912558 i am satisfied also that he felt guilty about the fact that melvin had been given up for adoption mr hood believed that after his death his wife would get along fine with her own resources and the survivor benefits from his pension
912559 mr hood would have been entitled to withdraw all of that money in cash and give it to his son
912560 once its deposited in the husbands account hes really entitled to do with that what he wants
912561 we find that many many people do not have a really clear understanding about the full ramifications of these arrangements
912562 youre really signing authority to another person to control your assets which can have devastating effects
912563 neanche il duce aveva osato tanto perch nel ventennio con la stessa dicitura di divieto di stazionamento il limite per ladunata sediziosa era fissato in cinque o piu persone
912564 it is difficult to understand how an individual who was refused registration as a gaming assistant could be employed at the halifax casino for any period of time let alone the timeframe noted above
912565 the violation appears to be a direct result of oversight on the part of both great canadian the parent company of the licensee and as the board understands it an experienced casino operator with other locations in canada as well as meg
912566 surely it is reasonable to expect that at least one of these parties would exercise adequate due diligence to ensure that full compliance with the regulatory requirements in nova scotia was achieved
912567 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
912568 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
912569 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
912570 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
912571 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
912572 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
912573 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
912574 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
912575 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
912576 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
912577 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
912578 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
912579 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
912580 in discussions with both governments i will cover matters of mutual interest including the response to the breakdown in the world trade organisation doha round of negotiations global financial uncertainty regional architecture and climate change mr rudd said

912582 my parents say it doesnt look like im affected on the field
912583 i say you taught me that show no weakness i played football i know how to pick and choose my battles when im hurt sometimes i grimace but i try not to show it
912584 thats something thats coming just wait i can see that happening just a matter of time

912590 justin morgan indicated that cooke may still have a career at craven park when he talked to the media after the win over the dragons but my sources have told me that he wont play for the club again
912591 further to that theyve indicated that cooke wont be sacked but the robins will not let him go for free
912592 i believe any club wanting his services will have to do a player exchange deal to get him because hes still got over two years left to run on his contract
912593 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
912594 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
912595 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said
912596 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time she said

912600 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
912601 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
912602 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
912603 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement

912637 the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
912638 weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for in our nations history obama said describing some of the issues plaguing the native american community
912639 have held church school classes and study groups on reparations
912640 to acknowledge the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the united states and in 13 american colonies between 1865 and to establish a commission to examine the institution of slavery subsequently de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against african americans and the impact of those forces on living african americans to make recommendations to the congress on appropriate remedies and other purposes
912641 it is impossible for a person who is not african american to get a large vote in the african american community against a substantial candidate the fact is i am white and it doesnt seem to matter what you do
912642 barack obama is a noble hearted patriot and humble christian and he has my full faith and support
912643 barack obama is a noble hearted patriot and humble christian
912644 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
912645 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
912646 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work

912674 jasper what do vampires do for bachelor parties youre not taking him to a strip club are you
912675 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
912676 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
912677 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
912678 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
912679 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
912680 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him

912688 the case may be a legal landmark because there is no precedent in disputes involving third parties who use or publish information from social networking sites
912689 it should not be assumed that profiles are simply read as information about an individual
912690 jenny like others is well aware that people s profiles can be just a front for several of the participants it seemed that position in the peer network was more significant than the personal information provided rendering the profile a place marker more than a self portrait

912692 although it indeed appears that for many young people social networking is all about me me me this need not imply narcissistic self absorption rather following mead s 1934 fundamental distinction between the i and the me as twin aspects of the self social networking is about me in the sense that it reveals the self embedded in the peer group as known to and represented by others rather than the private i known best by oneself

912700 the windows of the cab are calcined with solidified dirt and hardened grease
912701 sprouting from his shirt cuffs his tightly cinched collar the gaps between buttons are dense patches of coarse black gorilla like hair his body is carpeted in it his beard begins under his eyes and only barely spares his nose there are tufts of dark hair protruding from his aural canal and attached to his pinna making his ear look like a bristling venus flytrap
912702 grim mouth alert blue eyes her shoulders hunched up as if struggling against a strong wind even in the breathless summertime air she smells of stale menthol and rayon and gasoline and pencil shavings and body odor and fear the precinct
912703 the court held by a 5 4 vote that aliens detained as enemy combatants in guantanamo have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in american courts the decision frees none of them some of whom have been held without trial for six years but it makes it possible for them to argue to a federal district court judge that the administration has no factual or legal ground for imprisoning them if that judge is persuaded he must order their release
912704 senator john mccain called the decision one of the worst in the countrys history the conservative press was horrified the wall street journal said that kennedy had turned the constitution into a suicide pact no one explained why it would destroy america to allow people who claim innocence of any crime or threat a chance to defend that claim before an american judge who is presumably just as worried about his familys security as the president is why would it be suicidal to allow them the same opportunity for defense that we allow people indicted as serial killers
912705 environmental issues are often framed in a very negative context with good reason its hard to talk about this topic in an uplifting manner
912706 the goal is to make art with something that is a nonthreatening medium something that everybody could enjoy
912707 each globe also has a solution with a couple of exceptions some were more complicated like maybe geothermal warming the solutions were as simple as do your laundry in cold water turn down the thermostat
912708 the public in chicago responded so positively the globes sent a strong message
912709 the bay area globes will be serving as ads teasers
912710 one thing that we did intentionally was not scattering the globes so that theres a critical mass at crissy field if you get to spend an hour reading them its very powerful climate change is a big problem you have to stop it and confront it but at the same time the solutions are right there in front of us
912711 its hard to tell how long this is going to take
912712 its taking off on the interconnectedness of everything its not super scientific or literal
912713 i ended up doing all these formulas and then getting special auto body glue
912714 john and i going back to the monday night years and like a bunch of trained chimpanzees we are always talking about weve got the greatest schedule
912715 well this year we have evidence because i just picked up one of the preview magazines put out by pro football weekly which has been around for a long time and every year they have an article that says these are the 10 games that are must see games and granted they change once the season begins but from the vantage point of the off season looking into the season they list them one through 10 and mnf used to get about five or six of them and we would be pretty proud i just looked at the list a couple days ago the top seven are all on sunday night football one through seven starting with indianapolis against new england so the league when we got this package three years ago said do you know what we are going to make sunday night the premium night and theyve done it that doesnt even count what can happen in the flex scheduling
912716 i think that the fact that the giants won the super bowl this year in some way sort of added some intrigue to this whole season
912717 thats the great thing about our game that those things what you want what business wants what sponsors want what network bosses want doesnt mean a damn thing its you go out there and play and thats what the giants did in that super bowl their defense just dominated the patriots offensive line
912718 we are just going to sit in the back of the studio like being in the back of the classroom and keith and i are just going to try to make paper airplanes and do highlights and just try to keep it simple and only speak when spoken to
912719 its sort of like joining the oceans 11 crew this is the costas 11 crew and im elliott gould or carl reiner

912870 i got quite educated about the different forms of cancer what and where they attacked in the body
912871 its definitely a good idea for patients to experience it
912872 this may be a more effective way for them to understand and embrace cancer treatment
912873 visualizing the battle helped give them a sense of power and control over cancer
912874 that helps them to be the victor instead of the victim of cancer
912875 this is the strongest evidence to date that video games are not just entertainment but powerful tools that can impact behaviour and be important for health
912876 weve got the drugs but theyre not going to work if the kids arent going to take them
912877 what we do in the game is make it clear to people that this behaviour taking the follow up chemo monitoring side effects is important at a biological level it shows you the battle still going on in your body and what you need to do for a dramatic triumph over cancer
912878 yesterday in my car i looked to see if anybody in the street was spitting on the ground i didnt see anybody

912884 visst r det konstigt trots kunskap om att det f rekommer verv ld fr n ordningsvakter tar polisen f r givet att i valet mellan tre nerslagna m nniskor och sju utan en skr ma r det de slagna offren som r de skyldiga
912885 vad r v rst att bli kr nkt och misshandlad att felaktigt d mas i domstol eller den m nga g nger hatiska attityd jag f tt som knivhugg i ryggen och slag rakt i ansiktet detta av samh llets etablissemang som samtidigt gl mmer att det kan vara deras son eller dotter som r kar ut f r n got liknande n sta helg jag t nker inte l ta mig bli klappad p huvudet
912886 l t oss alla hoppas att r ttsv sendet tvingas att lystra och b rja skydda oss folket mot or ttf rdigat v ld fr n deras egna tj nstem n hur l nge kan de blunda f r det uppenbara
912887 sammantaget anser jag mig ha tillr ckligt underlag f r att kunna konstatera att det inte i obetydlig utstr ckning f rekommer obefogat v ld verv ld och ojuste beteende fr n ordningsvakters sida i samband med ingripanden mot krogg ster
912888 det finns tillr ckligt underlag f r att h vda att det tycks f rekomma att vissa ordningsvakter i inte obetydlig omfattning talar helt eller delvis osanning n r de h rs i m l r rande krogv ld
912889 det st r emellertid klart att de krogg ster som uts tts f r l gner fr n vakter samtidigt uts tts f r avsev rda risker i fr ga om r ttss kerheten i de bed mningar som domstolen har att g ra
912890 det som framkommit om r ttss kerhetsproblem n r vakter h rs i domstol r oroande det r sj lvfallet helt oacceptabelt om enskilda d ms oskyldiga p grundval av falska eller tillr ttalagda vittnesm l fr n krogvakter jag vill d rf r rekommendera rikspolisstyrelsen polismyndigheterna klagarmyndigheten och domstolsverket att verv ga vilka tg rder som kan beh va vidtas
912891 det fungerar inte s det vore d den f r karri ren
912892 en vakt som p dagen skyddar ledande politiker jobbar p h kte r polisaspirant vaktar milit ra objekt eller k r v rdetransporter kan p kv llar och n tter jobba sida vid sida med kriminella
912893 systemet har m lmedvetet f rslappat dem man kan hitta b de halvd va och sovande n mndem n p vissa f rhandlingar
912894 d ins g jag att det var k rt hur fan ska man klara sig ur detta va fan det var ju han som sparkade mig jag har ju inte gjort n got vem ska tro p mig vad g r jag h r tankarna springer friskt i skallen
912895 jag l rde mig tidigt av ldre kollegor hur man skulle skriva sig fri n r man beg tt vergrepp p omh ndertagna eller gripna
912896 dessa reportrar har n ra relation till de reportrar som jobbar f r en webbtidning som gs av en krogkoncern p stureplan reportrar som l ter sig mutas med bl a middagar sprit eller vip behandling p koncernens krogar
912897 det har gl mts bort att den grupp vakter som beter sig illa r en f rsvinnande liten minoritet som f r v ldigt mycket uppm rksamhet
912898 vid huvudf rhandlingen blev det pinsamt uppenbart f r mig hur vakterna h ll ihop och skapade en ber ttelse f r att motivera misshandel verv ld och kr nkande spr kbruk
912899 om jag h ll tyst och inte anm lde vakten skulle jag f g hem n r jag ist llet ville anm la det jag varit med om blev jag h nad och gripen
912900 vi minns nog alla hur kv llspressen snabbt var ute f r att s nka sj din l ngt innan r tteg ng delvis kanske detta drev kan f rklaras av att sj din r kvinna m jligen kan hennes partif rg ge henne fiender men det sj din varit med om kan h nda vem som helst
912901 det skulle inte hj lpa om jag satte gud fader sj lv i vittnesb set polis och vakter f r alltid r tt det r min advokats ord jag ska upp inf r domstol i dag talad f r v ld mot tj nsteman och v ldsamt motst nd
912902 det r ett samh llsproblem om osanningar i r tten fr n personer som r satta att uppr tth lla lag och ordning leder till att oskyldiga d ms d rf r granskar vi nu detta
912903 min h ndelse utspelade sig inte p krogen utan p en fotbollsmatch d r man anv nder sig av samma typ av ordningsvakter bevisligen
912904 att inte polisen tar promilletest i h ktet r rent r ttsvidrigt tycker jag de kan h lla folk i h kte helt utan grund f r att sedan skylla p fylla
912905 det h r till ts ske i v rt samh lle idag s fort n gon druckit vin befinner sig utan n ra v nner och bekanta omkring sig d f rsvinner all trov rdighet respekt och r ttvisa mot en hederlig medborgare vi betalar skatt f r det h r r ttsv sendet som d mer oskyldiga
912906 fr n en trevlig kv ll med mycket skratt till en kv ll full av v ld vem har gett vissa vakter denna makt och r ttighet att kunna upptr da p detta s tt
912907 anm la puh varf r f r att sen l ggas ner och f det bekr ftat att ingen bryr sig
912908 m dde d ligt psykiskt l nge efter detta och drar mig f r att g p krogen igen har faktiskt inte gjort det blir r dd n r jag ser vakter och arg k nns som om dom r labila anabola stinna monster som bara vill f utlopp f r sina inre aggressioner men att ge sig p f rsvarsl sa tjejer r s j vla fegt
912909 jag f r panik o b rjar skrika vansinnigt sl pp ut mig
912910 det m ste g att f lla en ordningsvakt f r misshandel om han hon gjort sig skyldig till det polisen och klagare m ste ta folk p allvar n r de blivit misshandlade av krogvakter vi kan ju inte ha ett samh lle d r personer fritt kan misshandla m nniskor utan att blir f llda f r det
912911 f rst efter ett tag slutar man sl man sl par in mig tillbaks p krogen och n r polis kommer till platsen uppger vakterna att jag hade slagit dem hotat dem och att jag varit mycket v ldsam poliserna k per hela deras l gn
912912 d puttades jag av polisen och kallades f r en juggehora jag plockade fram mitt presskort och sade att jag kommer att rapportera om detta fall och kr vde veta polisernas identitet
912913 jag fr gar vad fan de sysslar med jag m ste ju hem och ta mitt nattinsulin de drar mig in i cellen jag spj rnar mot s gott jag kan
912914 i anm lan stod det sedan att han omh ndertagits p en helt annan plats p stureplan och att han varit s full att han varit en fara f r sig sj lv och andra n got blodprov fick han inte l mna vilket man kan tycka borde vara en r ttighet man kan ju ven undra om en stupfull argumenterar f r att f l mna blodprov
912915 hela familjen blev slagen och satta i tv olika celler utan att ha r tten att g p toa utan fick kissa p golvet och sova p det familjen blev kraftigt kr nkt fr n b rjan till slut i 11 timmar
912916 han kom emot mig med h nderna och mamma gick emellan han slog henne ver munnen s kraftigt att hon ramlade omkull sedan sparkade han p henne
912917 man k nner sig maktl s de skriver att jag v grat l mna urinprov fast jag tydligt minns att inget ens bett mig om det de ljuger ihop en historia till sin f rdel
912918 tycker att det r synd att man inte kan k nna f rtroende f r s kallade tj nstem n
912919 jag har aldrig varit i klammeri med r ttvisan s jag visste inte vad jag hade att f rv nta mig en sak r var s ker jag vet att jag inte gjort n got
912920 detta utl ser ett raseriutbrott och kommer v ldigt ov ntat och hastigt till uttryck i form av ett angrepp mot delar av min kropp
912921 men f r en vakt bruka v ld s d r utan vidare och kalla en tjej f r hora fr gade min dotter r tten

912936 for the internal cohesion of the terror network it is enough for very different groups to be able to invoke him
912937 he apparently is with friendly tribes for whom a basic rule is irrevocable one does not send a guest to his doom
912938 the technique of the attack as well as the place and time point rather to an islamist or domestic turkish background
912939 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
912940 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people whose lived through this but were not broken
912941 i have to say that alexander isayevich lived a very difficult but a very happy wife
912942 during the day everything related to the funeral and the wake will be settled and done in accordance to his will
912943 then his health deteriorated towards the end of the day at night his suffering was not long
912944 ce matin jai entendu une explosion ensuite quand jai voulu aller au bureau la rue seman tait bloqu e cest en face du bangchen hotel je ne sais pas sil sagit du poste de police ou du restaurant les rumeurs parlent effectivement de 16 ou 18 policiers tu s la rue est rouverte d sormais
912945 on a juste vu qu la gare il y avait beaucoup de policiers en armes et de militaires mais personne ne nous a dit quoi que ce soit
912946 ciblant des points n vralgiques li s aux jeux olympiques
912947 die dsl synchronisation war vorhanden ich bekam nur keinen zugriff auf den server
912948 sie war sehr kompetent und konnte den fehler im netz von alice zuordnen
912949 mit alice kann jeder mehr aus seinem leben machen durch mehr kommunikation
912950 das war die richtige antwort nach dem schweren unfall von hockenheim
912951 detecting information concerning terrorism narcotics smuggling contraband including child pornography and other import or export control laws
912952 the older man who was the father in law of the younger man was taken to the queen elizabeth the queen mother hospital in margate as he was suffering from the cold
912953 the rest of the people on board were taken ashore at sheerness and the damaged boat was taken to southend
912954 always make sure you have the right equipment on board if you are going out to sea and ensure that you know how to use it in an emergency in this case the children had life jackets but the adults only had life rings they did manage to let off one hand held flare but the other was lost overboard considering the stressful situation he was in the older man remained calm and kept the family together whilst waiting for the lifeboats to arrive
912955 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
912956 we must do something just in case we are responsible because the consequences are too terrible if we are to blame and do nothing
912957 what kind of world is this who are these people
912958 but what we are picking up on is a sense that maybe there is an overinflation of the lips theres an overabundance of fillers in her face
912959 what i see with demi moore is more of an operation let me say it this way i see preservation of definition a preservation of facial architecture angularity very pretty
912960 i am passing this message on to gb not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
912961 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb ie this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc
912962 strategically the consequence was twofold a we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and b because we were disowning ourselves as a government we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
912963 so tactically we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but strategically we ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda
912964 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
912965 the truth is that dc was in trouble long before tb left but that was because he was being forced to choose on nl policy and found as a result that he couldnt differentiate properly
912966 the choice is and was always between gb running as the change candidate or as continuity nl he never needed to worry about distancing on iraq it was never going to be seen as his issue but he really needed to be seen as continuing nl not ditching it by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term
912967 ema has been a real success we will build on this and from next month every young person on ema will get financial support if they go on to university
912968 under labour there is really only one relationship which matters the relationship between the individual and the state
912969 we say that this common ground can help with the start of negotiations
912970 time is ripe for these talks and we should not lose this opportunity
912971 we feel that compared to years past there is a more pronounced serious will on the side of the other party
912972 we believe that no proposals should be made that lead to the iranian nation being denied its rights
912973 i would say its self explanatory and clear that you shouldnt extort patients
912974 i work on womens issues social affairs and workers rights
912975 he said lets make a deal you give me information and ill make it easy for you to go israel
912976 contingent on an applicants willingness to submit any information except for reliable information on his medical condition
912977 im pleased with my driving but i came here to win and loeb found a few seconds more
912978 we played cat and mouse all weekend and when i won a stage he usually won the next
912979 for there to be only nine seconds between us after all this crazy driving is amazing i lost the time though by not being brave enough in the narrow sections itll be difficult now but we must fight for the win on every round
912980 all in all it was a fantastic rally and an amazing fight and its just unfortunate i didnt win in front of my home fans
912981 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
912982 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida

912993 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
912994 i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day
912995 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
912996 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
912997 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
912998 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
912999 now im back at united the plan is to try to force my way into the first team plans ive had a good chance to do that on the trip to south africa
913000 weve got some more friendlies now so hopefully i can keep going like this
913001 it was great going away with the first team squad ive had some good games and really enjoyed myself but now it would be good to get pre season out of the way and start scoring goals
913002 it feels good to be back at united and its nice to see some old faces again so im going to continue to work hard and try to do enough to stay here and go on from there
913003 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
913004 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
913005 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
913006 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
913007 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
913008 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
913009 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
913010 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
913011 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
913012 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
913013 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
913014 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
913015 they are not engaged getting married or any of the reports
913016 mo woke up and cursed us out i was like damn that is a different dude
913017 i dont know if thats why she didnt write the letter
913018 i think shell think i wanted to get my face on tv and just miss her 21st
913019 i thought i was going to be crying like a little baby
913020 but when my letter came out i had my hat over my head and i couldnt think of anything else apart from mum and dad are not speaking to me
913021 honestly i want it to happen and when it does i cant f ing wait
913022 but right now ive got to sort my career and my life out it would be so unfair to expect a girl to deal with my s
913023 i would like to find a lady im crazy about id be happy if i met one who works in a corner shop as long as she was cool witty and had a good sense of humour
913024 i didnt really have a career i was just partying with girls
913025 i just want to say that is the reason why i jumped out of bed ive never had a guy say something like that to me
913026 do you want to kick me in the nuts as well
913027 that was the worst guy and girl moment in history
913028 the officers didnt treat her differently than anyone else they explained it was against the law and gave her a stern talking to
913029 kelly became really tearful and seemed incredibly embarrassed she was apologising over and over again she wasnt looking for any special treatment despite being famous and accepted the ticket in good grace
913030 as soon as she got teary she put on a massive pair of shades and quickly regained her composure it looked like shed been at a business meeting because she was wearing a smart black suit
913031 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse and dusty springfield its just labelling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision that i have
913032 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me
913033 its kind of strange and disheartening to be constantly told who i look like or who i sound like
913034 you do get some people who hit slightly closer to where im coming from
913035 i got compared to diana ross the other day which was a real compliment and someone also wrote that i was the female otis redding which really made me feel good because hes a hero of mine
913036 i said you might want to have a shower you wont be able to have one tomorrow
913037 i think there are things going on in the world that no one knows about and they cant be revealed
913038 we havent changed the direction of the development of ffxiii
913039 were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
913040 im telling the development team to not think about the xbox 360 right now we can think about it after the development kits arrive
913041 no workers should be subjected to any threat no matter what job they undertake
913042 the traffic wardens do perform a very important function and i think most people in the public in northern ireland recognise that they contribute to road safety and they have a job to do
913043 wii music completes what miyamoto wrote in his proposal when he came up with the idea for the wii
913044 he was saying that he needs to think up more ideas now
913045 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now
913046 we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
913047 the interesting debate is affordability and does tfl have the money to do what it wants to do
913048 to stand still requires a huge amount of effort there is not sufficient robustness in the system to leave it alone it is still very fragile
913049 would have implications for our funding that would make it more difficult
913050 i would like to think that we can help through our ability to do project work in terms of value for money and certainty that the job will get done
913051 well i doubt ill be in it because i made
913052 i would hope that freddy doesnt look like me i would hope that maybe hes wearing janitors overalls and maybe he has an old baseball hat on instead of my fedora let a new actor reinterpret it thats the fun of remaking it
913053 if they want to ask me to play the dream analysis expert that would be fun

913060 in keinster form hat der gesetzgeber daran gedacht pro zehn pcs in einem unternehmen eine geb hr zu fordern
913061 die ausweitung der einhebung von rundfunkgeb hren kommt f r die sp nicht in frage da mit dem internet verbundene pcs nicht automatisch zum empfang eines radio oderfernsehprogramms des orf geeignet sein m ssen zum beispiel keine soundausgabe und f r den empfang eines internetstreams unbedingt ein download notwendig ist
913062 daher sehen wird diese ger tekonstellationen auch nicht als rundfunkempfangseinrichtungen im sinne des rundfunkgeb hrengesetzes an

913086 if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written
913087 i dont look like the other men who have been president
913088 if most people agreed that obama was like britney he wouldnt be a superstar
913089 i honestly wonder if the mccain people know what they are doing
913090 to andy from larry you say its comments and grammer like yours that makes us in middle america look stupid no mate its you go to a dictionary
913091 someone please tell me why a person with just a little say a quarter or an eighth caucasian ancestry is not referred to as white when a person with just a little african ancestry is referred to as black

913093 john mccains ad comparing barack obama to paris and britney is an effective attack on obamas greatest strength

913101 uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
913102 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
913103 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
913104 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
913105 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
913106 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
913107 i have reason to know the kids who were involved the families who were involved and ive never known them to harbor this type of feeling
913108 this is a cautious trading update using careful language to highlight the uncertain and challenging markets the company faces particularly in the uk and u s
913109 our businesses continue to show resilience in uncertain and challenging markets
913110 we see material value in carphone warehouse shares following the in our view necessary cut to uk fixed revenue guidance at the 1q trading statement consensus risk has mitigated and there is now scope for strong price performance
913111 if cpw does not bid or fails to win the auction for tiscali uk there may be scope for a capital return given net cash of 170 million pounds on the balance sheet post the best buy deal

913114 we are really pleased to be able to offer this new exciting and innovative play area for the community both in and around market harborough
913115 a great deal of work and planning has gone into delivering this project and we hope it is well received by children of all ages
913116 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the israeli army let the injured enter
913117 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
913118 will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity
913119 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
913120 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
913121 some students have said they are worried about travelling across other gangs turf this is a problem for students in london and other major cities and something that could never have been factored in when the diploma was being designed
913122 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
913123 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
913124 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
913125 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
913126 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
913127 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
913128 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
913129 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
913130 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
913131 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
913132 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
913133 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
913134 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
913135 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
913136 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
913137 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
913138 pressure buildup in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe resulted in plutonium contamination of a storage room

913141 det avspeglas ven i det faktum att bolag som rapporterar en utveckling b ttre n f rv ntat och med positiva prognoser drabbas av kursfall vid rapporteringstillf llet oron och d rmed volatiliten p aktiemarknaden l r best till dess att konojunkturscenariot klarnar
913142 chinese parents tend to be concerned only with studying studying
913143 if you look at cuba russia north korea eastern europe these programs dont change until the political system does
913144 chinese kids eat too much and too well and after meals they might be too full to exercise
913145 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
913146 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
913147 one ongoing concern remains harpers determination to end the canadian wheat board monopoly on the marketing of western barley crops a recent federal court ruling upheld the wheat boards right to serve as a single marketing desk for canadian barley
913148 but that does not change the determination of the government of canada to see a dual market for canadian farmers
913149 i hope the wheat board will start working with the government to make sure this is gonna happen cause its gonna happen one way or another whether it takes a little bit of time or a lot of time its gonna happen
913150 the harper government is tinkering with the rules governing the election of canadian wheat board directors in an attempt to influence this falls scheduled vote critics charge
913151 they think they can marshal lots of corporate money and lots of big spender money and try to destroy the board by advertising against it
913152 letztes jahr haben wir verschiedene tests quer durch das land gemacht um die tauglichkeit kompatibilit t und den nutzen eines digitalen postassistenten auf kunden sowie mitarbeiterseite zu testen das feedback war von beiden seiten u erst positiv besonders hinsichtlich der einfachen bedienbarkeit des cn3 ich bin zuversichtlich dass die innovative technologie und expertise von intermec royal mail dabei unterst tzen wird kundenbed rfnissen gerecht zu werden und einen vorsprung in einem wettbewerbsintensiven markt zu sichern

913154 if anybody asked me to plant grasses in those three places
913155 during the summer when temperatures and humidity are high and the grass is stressed by the heat the potential for disease development increases
913156 when you combine this with the added stress of a low mowing height which the olympic games requires you really need to keep an eye on things to prevent little issues from turning into big problems
913157 at the beginning every time when we suggested something to them they would first check it with their own experts
913158 now they totally rely on our advice on how to maintain the turf
913159 nervous about this project because they know the entire world is watching them and in their eyes this is their opportunity to prove what they are capable of
913160 it should be noted that last year at this time we had no proven quarterback
913161 there is no substitution for experience we cant create practice situations where you are down by two with a minute to go we can try but we cant re create that environment where you have 100 000 or 75 000 people and a national television audience watching you now that hes had that experience i think that his experience will carry this football team
913162 we need to have a third quarterback but we have enough players on our team currently who have played quarterback that we can move in there in a situation
913163 as the quarterback youre going to take the most credit and the most blame when things go bad
913164 i just need to worry about what my teammates say about it
913165 guys have to step it up step up the approach step up the tenacity some people have to do better or there will be some changes
913166 if we end up pitching and playing some kids down the stretch thats what were going to do if were not going to play with energy and tenacity
913167 i dont know this is not some kind of threat but you dont just keep playing people in the lineup or handing them the ball to pitch and getting nothing
913168 ive got people on my butt he didnt specify who if i were my boss id be upset right now that becomes a trickle down effect i wont hesitate to do anything
913169 i hope the headlines dont say im going to pull people from the rotation and lineup all im saying is that if people dont step it up you have to go in a different direction whether you bring other players up or work with what you have and change some things around
913170 i feel terrible if youre losing its supposed to hurt a little bit
913171 im ashamed maybe ive got them overrated i take it personally
913172 im disappointed from the start of the season to this point ive been more than disappointed probably shocked by our performance
913173 i told the team on two or three occasions weve got two teams ahead of us chicago and minnesota and i wouldnt trade this team for either one dont take this as a slap at anyone else those teams have been better than us but it his confidence in his club hasnt seemed to encourage anybody weve had some performances that have been terrible
913174 we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are
913175 im not going to get into singling guys out because thats not my style but there are some guys who need to step it up you can draw your own conclusions
913176 the big thing for me is i have to throw a strike on the first pitch
913177 i have to keep my head up and keep working because i know i can do better
913178 im asking people in the bullpen and pitching coach chuck hernandez about how i can do better
913179 my job is to go out there and hold the lead and i didnt do it thats what frustrates me the most
913180 i felt good and i felt i made some good pitches but at the same time i fell behind a few guys and they hit my mistakes
913181 its the time you get up to go get some popcorn or go to the bathroom or something
913182 thats his thing being able to release his defensive linemen when somebodys backed up and killing the quarterback
913183 you dont say youre the right guard on the punt team
913184 they are born and made to tackle and so i have to step it up a notch
913185 theres really no zone concepts youve got a guy one on one and either you win or you lose the competition part is what really gets me going with it
913186 one step off one little glitch with your snapper everything is just so precise
913187 why give a returner the ball in the middle of the field and let him go whatever way he wants to go
913188 thats what were going to do its an old school way of doing stuff but it sure is beneficial
913189 people say why would they kick it right to that guy
913190 i know growing up watching the nfl games i would never watch special teams
913191 i guess people who dont really understand the game of football dont understand how important a punt really is youre fighting for field position in this league 10 yards is a huge difference
913192 i just remember looking at the film and seeing that ball go out of bounds in that section of the stadium the crowds like yeah they got it
913193 he pushes us to the edge to the breaking point and beyond to see how we handle it
913194 i wish yall could videotape the things we go through with this man
913195 you try to make the drills so difficult that toward the end you really find out who the guys are who has that inner strength and toughness
913196 they can get nasty but thats ok because games can get nasty
913197 i want them going through the pain of commitment together i think thats important theyre earning the privilege of wearing that jersey
913198 well think were done for the day and hell have more for us
913199 i am always trying to challenge these guys how can i put these guys in some really severe adversity
913200 sometimes they think theyre done but theyre not done ill throw one little thing in there maybe two maybe three maybe 10
913201 by 23 or so youll find out who your guys are you see whos rolling their eyes and shaking their heads and whos still intense
913202 are we getting tougher are we more competitive are we pulling together
913203 personally i dont think theyre working any harder than us
913204 and theres some unfinished business here that i hope to contribute to finishing
913205 its the time you get up to go get some popcorn or go to the bathroom or something
913206 thats his thing being able to release his defensive linemen when somebodys backed up and killing the quarterback
913207 you dont say youre the right guard on the punt team
913208 they are born and made to tackle and so i have to step it up a notch
913209 theres really no zone concepts youve got a guy one on one and either you win or you lose the competition part is what really gets me going with it
913210 one step off one little glitch with your snapper everything is just so precise
913211 why give a returner the ball in the middle of the field and let him go whatever way he wants to go
913212 thats what were going to do its an old school way of doing stuff but it sure is beneficial

913216 i just remember looking at the film and seeing that ball go out of bounds in that section of the stadium the crowds like yeah they got it
913217 it should be noted that last year at this time we had no proven quarterback
913218 there is no substitution for experience we cant create practice situations where you are down by two with a minute to go we can try but we cant re create that environment where you have 100 000 or 75 000 people and a national television audience watching you now that hes had that experience i think that his experience will carry this football team
913219 we need to have a third quarterback but we have enough players on our team currently who have played quarterback that we can move in there in a situation
913220 as the quarterback youre going to take the most credit and the most blame when things go bad
913221 i just need to worry about what my teammates say about it

913406 transit oriented development is not easy not for the squeamish
913407 but i am going to focus on what is great about this project and what it means to the community and what it means to the region
913408 this time weve increased the communitys input tenfold in the selection process
913409 what is selected would be sympathetic to the historic integrity of the building and allow for community engagement with the structure
913410 i look forward to reviewing the proposals that are submitted and then seeing the old naval hospital go from a heartbreaking state of disrepair to a source of civic and neighborhood pride
913411 the city of laurel no longer feels a sense of pride in laurel mall
913412 were proposing to create a completely new experience that will have little semblance to the malls former self
913413 i left here went to miami beach as an outsider didnt know a single person there
913414 the population was 3 percent african american all seven city commissioners were anglo and i competed against local developers who were established and i won
913415 being a minority in this country and this business has always made me somewhat of an outsider
913416 it was always an insiders game here in d c and being an insider really comes with longevity and establishment
913417 when i was here almost my entire tenure i was perceived as controversial i was very political i was kind of perceived as a wheeler dealer now in new york id be like bland in miami im bland
913418 i remembered joking and laughing and saying its going to be a short book have your dad have 250 million and dont lose it
913419 i thought there needed to be a credible book on how to create wealth and entrepreneurship from someone starting from the ground up
913420 by me losing those deals which was a big setback business wise i ended up winning later
913421 i would like to think its a small local well funded minority that opposes it
913422 it is a huge shot in the arm for springfield which really to date has not had the density or been as vibrant as anticipated
913423 this really puts them in the thick of things instead of on the outskirts
913424 when we acquired the asset there were grumblings of what may happen with brac base realignment and closure but we decided to take a chance
913425 it will help business owners whether they are retail or restaurants and those are important things
913426 from our perspective this does take springfield development to the next tier
913427 we have already done a lot of great things and were going to do a lot of great things
913428 were making very good progress in southwest and weve worked with private developers on sites around the baseball stadium
913429 weve done everything from large deals to partnering with the community in creating training programs for residents
913430 were selling everything from the dance poles the girls dance on to the credit card machines the metal detectors and the bar
913431 ive done a number of nightclubs but this is my first nude dancing place

913435 innovation at prince william has been competing with northern virginia and montgomery county for life science companies but because george mason is starting to have a similar focus companies are being drawn to that environment
913436 prince william county has seen loudoun county with howard hughes medical institute and seen the development of biotech in montgomery county and now it is taking a lead to get that in this region
913437 prince william had been left behind it is now marketing this area for biomedical its a tremendous tug of war to bring these companies to their sites
913438 in montgomery county they started 25 years ago with biotech and if you look at it today theres really not that much progress in terms of large companies
913439 we go into a marketplace and were realistic about whats going on there
913440 we dont want to bring in an ultra luxury condominium in two months
913441 it was like you had celebrity status only if you got in at ground zero
913442 i am sure they will abide by our statement our position is that he will not be permitted to go
913443 i personally find what this guy has said abhorrent and i think it would be inappropriate to have him visit
913444 im very anxious to see what theyre going to do with it
913445 its going to dictate everything in this neighborhood business is good and i think its going to get better
913446 its one of the largest contiguous parcels of ground in the district
913447 i would remodel no question about it to keep up with the neighborhood
913448 the post 9 11 impact in the northern virginia office market has been enormous
913449 were not building bombs here but were certainly architecting the war here thats manifested itself into more leasing in the market
913450 there was huge attention being paid to anti terrorism to homeland security to intelligence agencies as well as the national institutes of health and bioterrorism
913451 indeed the defendants rationalizations and minimizations for his conduct take on many variations and permutations but reduce to the following i am too rich too powerful too successful and too entitled to do things my way to be accountable and punished for this splinter of a crime
913452 we argued at trial that while mistakes were made and there were flaws in douglass administrative apparatus douglas committed no crime we continue to believe that
913453 its going to take a long time to lease those buildings up
913454 its a very dynamic market and we think we have a very unique building
913455 we feel that it is going to lease in a shorter rather than longer period of time
913456 we sold the buildings because we were pleased with the return on the investment we could get at this time

913468 whenever i see an adult riding a bicycle i know there is hope for mankind
913469 when you see them up at two in the morning talking or crying or sharing gossip were right there with them
913470 id say i became like a big sister to some of them
913471 when they were having a problem i was certainly willing to provide advice i hope it was good advice
913472 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
913473 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
913474 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
913475 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
913476 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
913477 if youre a developer in washington d c youre not writing off any neighborhoods
913478 you look to develop where you can the time is right
913479 youve already got the beginnings of a good mixture of employment and retail nearby
913480 its disappointing to see it just viewed as a place for people to work
913481 it has the ability to be a new community with a historic context that can really evolve into a cultural center
913482 sure old smelly goat herding dude im the lord what everrrrr ok lt cool if im god i command you to uhhhh ok mix shit with your bread and eat it
913483 you spend your life working hard raising your kids right and paying your taxes and your bills but you screw
913484 development sites are hard to come by in arlington county
913485 we really feel like its going to deliver a tremendous project
913486 theres just not that many properties like this that go available
913487 it hasnt been on sale for 90 years and who knows when itll go on sale again
913488 i think the citys position is clear it was done on government time its the property of the government
913489 aftermath unseen 9 11 photos by a new york city cop
913490 he was adamant that it was done at my expense with my equipment and not a single department resource
913491 we prefer to stay in the same place but we know the move is inevitable
913492 we keep talking about baseball baseball baseball but it only happens 81 days a year
913493 we want to design a district that works on game days and on non game days if it doesnt youll have it great for the 81 days of baseball and then dead the rest of the time
913494 building permits have been given but beyond that i am not quite sure
913495 there will be no mention of condom or safe sex in the revised module on life skill education programme but we will be focusing on the aspirations of the youngsters and will also talk about being faithful to ones partner and abstinence there should be no hypocrisy on the subject
913496 we want our children to have good character there is no need to give them sex education the way it is taught is not good
913497 we dont ever want to talk about sex yet were the second largest population in the world somebody s fucking
913498 is it wrapped in fancy gift paper or just plain brown paper
913499 will you now come down and sign for it please
913500 now its like a snowball coming down the mountain where weve made deals and brokers realize theyre not the pioneer
913501 theres now more district users who have accepted crystal city as an urban transient friendly place with new retail
913502 theyre always thinking about how to put their money into their programs and not into the operations of the business
913503 crystal city is millions of dollars less expensive over the term of the lease than downtown
913504 it was part of the educational style of the girls to give them an international experience
913505 the land was zoned industrial in the first place because were concerned about having people live so close to the nearby airport
913506 things are definitely up in the air about the long term use of that property
913507 we can cluster our communities and stay out of the runway protection zone and other areas faa regulators tell us to stay away from
913508 i really believe the romance is going out of my marriage
913509 because mine moshe is not if you excuse me performing very well in bed these days
913510 i dont think you need worry sexual performance always begins to drop off in men of advanced years its normal but tell me when did you first notice moshes failing performance
913511 i noticed it twice last night doctor and once again this morning
913512 since last summer ive had people coming in wanting to buy it
913513 were excited about the location and with baseball that can only make it better

913521 usually its the other way around im working towards becoming a waiter eventually thats my goal it may sound silly
913522 its a different form of expression too writing for yourself and its something id always wanted to do theres a lot of risk involved but im having a blast to be honest with you
913523 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
913524 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
913525 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
913526 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
913527 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
913528 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
913529 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
913530 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
913531 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
913532 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
913533 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
913534 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
913535 have already been hired and they have already begun working
913536 it would probably break every rule in the book but id say go and unplug every computer in every library

913545 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
913546 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
913547 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
913548 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
913549 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis
913550 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
913551 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
913552 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
913553 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
913554 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
913555 we learn english what kind of customs americans have how bradford is and how wonderful this place is
913556 this is my first trip abroad and i want to know how different american culture is the way of thinking
913557 this is the first year theyve given the students bicycles which gives them more independence
913558 we hope the experience will be one you remember forever
913559 we hope to learn from you as much as you from us

913563 a jazz music club in monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise currently the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away thus our proposed club the c note would have the local market all to itself plus jazz is extremely popular in monroe over 100 000 people attended monroes jazz festival last summer several well known jazz musicians live in monroe and the highest rated radio program in monroe is jazz nightly which airs every weeknight finally a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to 1 000 per year on jazz entertainment it is clear that the c note cannot help but make money
913564 the fact that remuneration must correspond to the true value of performance constitutes an essential element of the social market economy

913611 we have seen the land but papers are missing we are ready to buy but not until we are happy

913619 we were known for our cocktails and at the rate people drank them i knew there was a lucrative market out there
913620 the streets of kampala with all their cafes provided plenty of office space for me like the temptations sang in their 1960s hit papa was a rolling stone wherever he lay his hat was his home in my case wherever i sit is my office
913621 i cant remember how i stumbled on transnet but i am glad i did with an office a base of operation things are looking up my clients now meet me in my office and because of that sense of establishment business is beginning to trickle in including snaring a lucrative utl contract

913627 im just happy that he had a really strong race here jarno would have had a stronger race if he hadnt been caught behind mark webber because of a bad start overall im very happy we had a strong result today
913628 certainly from the moment he drove out of the garage on friday he has been on it all weekend
913629 if you really look at his sector times from qualifying earlier in the season he was struggling to put a complete lap together but generally showing he had the speed to do it
913630 he proved to himself in hockenheim particularly on race pace how quick he was and the fact he had an issue and he just continued from that point this weekend

913633 ive just staggered in from katys book launch and i have to report it was wonderful packed to the rafters with sweaty poets who can search out a free bar like a shark in a blood bank many many books sold and her peers seem slightly in awe of her talent a fair crowd about eighty note i think the bookshop staff counted 85 through the door who had a fine time and the girl was on form her chosen readings were two of her less elliptical works and went down well though she was very much preaching to the choir in summation a resounding triumph

913635 its an exciting opportunity for me because ive always been a fan of the team and i have a lot of friends who are big fans of the steelers
913636 all i remember is that the first play was a disaster
913637 i doubt if the opportunity will be there holmes said
913638 he still wants me to be the leader of the receiving group so thats my focal point this year
913639 no i dont have nothing to do with that offensive tackle willie colon said
913640 i doubt if thats any worry on anybodys mind right now we came in to play football whatever happens inside the organization happens
913641 those guys didnt like the way willie was blocking them and willie didnt like the way he got hit veteran receiver hines ward said
913642 but its training camp its all fun you just have to be smart about it willie you cant do that in the game so dont do it out there dont throw the ball at other players thats the lesson for the day you cant throw the ball at people you just have to find a way to get him back retaliate and do it in an orderly fahsion where youre not hindering your team with a penalty its a learning process i talked to willie about it
913643 he came in in excellent shape hes a veteran player came in great shape ran well an opportunity presented itself to give him some reps with the first unit at left guard i thought he took advantage of it i threw a bone to a man who came in in great shape and ran well
913644 i honestly do but were talking about practice were talking about practice man were talking about practice were talking about practice were not talking about the game were talking about practice when you come to the arena and you see me play youve seen me play right youve seen me give everything ive got but were talking about practice right now
913645 rashard mendenhall may not have a signed contract yet but that hasnt stopped him from working out at the steelers facility on the south side mendenhall the teams first first round draft choice put in another workout on thursday as he left the facility he said hes looking forward to his first pro training camp in the old days an unsigned rookie this close to training camp would come nowhere near the teams facility some agents would not even let their unsigned players come to town until they had a contract and their signing bonus in hand but times have changed and rookie contract negotiations rarely drag on as they once did because of the unofficial slotting system for draft picks while the star running back from illinois along with the teams second round pick wide receiver limas sweed remain unsigned coach mike tomlin and bossman kevin colbert both expressed confidence they will have contracts by sunday and report to training camp in latrobe on time with their new teammates

913656 i dont want to be confrontational i told the katikkiro to tell those people to stop inciting people through cbs fm i prefer they stop it themselves before we move to do so
913657 of course i was aware of the arrests because they told me that some people have been breaking the law and they have been arrested
913658 the procedures are important but even more important is the substance of the cases did somebody breach the law or not the fact that somebody must be produced in court or released within 48 hours is a procedure but beyond the procedure there is the substance itself
913659 suppose you boxed me and i get bruised okay the policeman who arrests you may have followed the wrong procedure and that will be condemned but what about my bruise
913660 if the police delay to bring to court somebody beyond 48 hours the court will order them to do so so really there is no incurable breach of the law
913661 the mistake of the other young magistrate was to say release them unconditionally you cannot say release people unconditionally because you dont know what crime they committed suppose they had committed a very serious crime what happens that means you introduce impunity

913730 seven ways to increase productivity in the las vegas chefs business
913731 if you tell someone in the las vegas chefs field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
913732 most las vegas chefs companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
913733 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
913734 our las vegas chefs company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
913735 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
913736 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company

913739 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
913740 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing las vegas chefs workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels

913796 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
913797 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
913798 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
913799 the little old lady who got thrown in jail because she hit a burgler over the head with a frying pan and killed him as he was attempting to break into her home
913800 skid on august 1st 2008 3 57 am typical fascist comment oyochick and cindy immediately berating the survivors for not stopping the guy come on and you would have done better big talk i am guessing that since you are american you are probably very overweight and probably could not have moved fast enough to do anything maybe if this happened in texas the killer could have shot more people rather than just killing one since he probably would have had a gun you like to bash canada buddy but you need us more than we need you where do you think you get most of your oil its not the middle east oh and water your government is already begging us for it since half your states are drying up like prunes you probably dont know any of this since it is a well known fact around the world that you are mostly a bunch of mentally challenged idiots with the lowest education levels your comments show your true nature you are closer to the killer in attitude than the survivors you are a violent race just ask anyone outside of your country
913801 i hope those blood curdling screams haunt them till the day they die i hope those blood curdling screams haunt them till the day they die
913802 stop i have a gun stop i have a gun boom
913803 unfortunately it does seem that many americans are very ignorant
913804 brave while canadians were cowards if the same thing happened in america i d say the same thing
913805 im moving around so sitting down is not something i do a lot of
913806 youll only find me in this office five or six days a month sometimes 10 i travel quite a lot
913807 i spend my time in places like london new york and detroit
913808 we have companies with a creditor matrix of 700 000 people and we have to send to all of them
913809 we look like a dot com company its a very interactive place so we want it to be open and friendly
913810 however as the captain of our marketing team jonathan convinced me that we needed to get our name in front of our contacts and keep it there
913811 when i visit friends and contacts from six years ago i still find the kcc branded basketball hoops on their desks in front of them every day
913812 the companys foray into the bottom segment of the pyramid will create tremendous brand awareness in an entire section of the population and open a whole new population in the urban market these customers will start with our two wheelers and then graduate to bigger m amp m vehicles
913813 this may well be an intelligent strategic decision by the m amp m management as the initial investment is very marginal rs 110 crore for a company that has a capex well in excess of rs 2 000 crore rs 20 billion
913814 we will invest 100 million in the next 12 months to launch six regional channels under the star brand in india
913815 we are unveiling the dow jones india titans a 30 stock index tracking the stock market performance of prominent indian companies
913816 it will be licensed to financial institutions as the basis of investment products such as exchange traded funds
913817 we have seen a re weighting of risk around the world but the world itself is being economically re rated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes
913818 the news reports are completely false and baseless there are no such plans
913819 you can get a much lower rate below 8 per cent of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on
913820 as things stand perhaps to look at a rate of inflation of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
913821 the aggregate demand is also increasing with money supply growing at more than 20 per cent continuously for more than three years
913822 i am hopeful that within a year inflation would come down to normal level of 5 6 per cent
913823 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slowdown than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent
913824 several existing laws restrict or undermine competition a review of such policies should be undertaken by the government to remove their competition restricting effect on the road and airport sectors
913825 the government should thus set some threshold after which competition is allowed to flourish
913826 more competition and implementation of competition policy would also lead to better corporate governance by the corporate houses and help them in better compliance
913827 any increase in transaction tax as proposed would increase the transaction cost and may keep farmers and hedgers out of the market an outcome which would fail to achieve the objectives of commodity futures markets
913828 therefore any increase in transaction cost would lead to lower trading activity and higher volatility
913829 therefore we do not have sufficient evidence to support that futures market leads to higher inflation
913830 however the emerging situation needs to resolve itself soon since the industry has only limited capacity to keep absorbing these cost escalations
913831 no workers should be subjected to any threat no matter what job they undertake
913832 the traffic wardens do perform a very important function and i think most people in the public in northern ireland recognise that they contribute to road safety and they have a job to do
913833 mein sieg in wimbledon ber gasquet war so etwas wie ein startschuss dieser sieg gibt mir jetzt noch viel mehr selbsvertrauen
913834 er hat w hrend einer eifersuchtskrise seine 35 jahre alte frau mit einem gro en messer enthauptet und ist mit dem kopf auf die stra e gegangen
913835 auswirkungen auf millionen menschen und wir d rfen nicht zulassen dass das passiert
913836 selbst nach diesem schlechten ergebnis sind wir noch mitten im wm rennen
913837 wir haben ein gutes rennen gezeigt die unterschiede zu mclaren sind minimal
913838 wir m ssen auch w hrend dieser pause hart arbeiten und uns in den bereichen verbessern wo wir defizite haben
913839 es ist ein ausgesprochen enger kampf derzeit kommt es auf die tagesform an
913840 ich verstehe dass die mehrheit der nachrichten naive sein m gen aber ich hoffe dass wir auch einen kreativen und erfrischenden blick auf das thema erhalten werden
913841 ratet einmal ich gebe euch einen hinweis ab und zu nennt mama mich so
913842 ja wir hatten da mal so einen hnlichen fall da war boris becker hier der hatte auch keinen pass dabei da haben wir ihn ein paar asse schlagen lassen da war die sache klar das ist boris becker der konnte dann weiterfahren franz beckenbauer war auch mal hier auch ohne pass der hat dann so ein bisschen mit dem ball gedribbelt und gespielt da war die sache auch klar das ist beckenbauer den lie en wir dann auch weiterfahren
913843 guter mann sie fahren so gut hier haben sie ein paar n sse von uns
913844 sagen sie mal gute frau ich freue mich ja sehr aber wo haben sie denn die ganzen haseln sse her
913845 ach wissen sie wir essen so gerne ferrero k sschen k nnen aber die n sse nicht mehr beissen
913846 tut mir leid kleines h ndchen ich wollte dich nicht erschrecken
913847 aber woran erkennen sie denn dass ich eine blondine bin
913848 now with the political crises today the parliament does not meet under these conditions we cannot present it but it is ready
913849 this was a big trauma for the children of the village
913850 it was horrible the kids were playing at hanging each other afterwards at school
913851 however those who are condemned are always living in fear that they might be executed
913852 many are receiving psychiatric treatment because of this constant fear
913853 if you study the cases of people sentenced to death in lebanon
913854 with most of them you will find big contradictions with international law their rights during the trial were not respected so if you dont respect the rights of the accused you cannot be sure that the decision is right
913855 lebanon as a state signs everything but nothing is implemented
913856 mixing the drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of condemned inmates has a condition dyslexia which causes him confusion with regard to numbers
913857 the most well known example of a jurisdiction entrusting its execution administration to an incompetent individual is the infamous dr doe in missouri
913858 varied the amount of thiopental he gave inmates on a whim without informing anyone
913859 the federal government chose to rely upon the only person in the country who has been explicitly barred by a federal court from participating in lethal injection executions
913860 a thorough and detailed examination of dr doerhoffs shocking lack of knowledge of the basic tenets of the drugs and procedures involved in a lethal injection execution dr doerhoffs admitted challenges with dyslexia that affected his ability to mix and measure the drugs as well as his record of more than 20 malpractice suits and revoked privileges at two hospitals
913861 we are shocked to see yemeni authorities resorting to penal prosecution and directing charges to members of the press and such charges may risk the lives of innocent journalists
913862 this issue has a terrible effect as the media will fear publishing any reports criticizing the government or the army in order to keep its personnel safe
913863 this may lead to abolishing the constitutional and legal protection of freedom of press and expression
913864 the newspaper published an article about voluntary tribal leaders who joined government troops in the fight against houthi supporters the paper also wrote about corruption and the malicious desire of those who want confrontations between the government and houthis to last for a longer period of time in order to serve their personal interests
913865 applying the death penalty to only a small number of extremely serious offenders
913866 generally this significant reform has registered smooth progress in the transitional period
913867 it also strengthens the protection of human rights in the judicial field
913868 those who could be absolved will not be given any capital punishment and those who need not be executed immediately will not get immediate executions
913869 the court should ensure that the death penalty would only be imposed on those who have committed extremely serious crimes
913870 death sentences with a reprieve can punish the guilty but also reduce the number of death penalties
913871 as peoples courts across china have been strictly controlling and cautiously applying the death penalty over the past dozen years the number of death penalty cases has kept declining and reached its lowest point last year
913872 im very disappointed to learn that the canadian government is not taking some action to get this man returned to canada where he should serve a life sentence we certainly dont want a man like that walking the streets
913873 but to execute him is degrading its reducing authorities to the same level as people who kill people killing people is wrong and the european view is we wont get down in the gutter with the people who commit murders
913874 im just amazed that the canadian government would wash its hands just like pontius pilate
913875 in effect what i think is that the people in government in canada are subcontracting the death penalty exactly the same way the united states of america has sent people to places like afghanistan where they are subject to torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in order to get them to give evidence when americans themselves couldnt do it in america and no europeans would do it
913876 the reality of this particular case is that were we to intervene it would very quickly become a question of whether we are prepared to repatriate a double murderer to canada
913877 in light of this governments strong initiatives on tackling violent crime i think that would send the wrong signal to the canadian population
913878 i would not say you could lose your reputation but you could certainly damage it
913879 that bill concerning the ratification of the sixth protocol banning death penalty had been discussed thoroughly several times but we did not gather sufficient votes to deal with the problem
913880 it will be wrong to say that the state duma has relegated the bill to the background despite the fact that it was not voted on but there is logical possibility that the next legislative chamber will consider and prepare it for another round of votes certainly it should be one of its priorities
913881 the senseless nature of the death penalty has been proven by the thousand year history of mankind and modern civilisation toughening of punishment by itself up to the death penalty is not a panacea is not the most efficient instrument in the struggle against crime
913882 the most efficient weapon in the struggle against the crime is the inevitability of punishment everybody knows that and not the cruelty of punishment this is the first thing secondly i am deeply convinced that by using the death penalty in relation to its citizens even criminals the state educates its citizens in cruelty and brings forth new cruelty on the part of citizens in relation to each other and in relation to the state itself and this is also harmful and counterproductive
913883 in my opinion the power to impose the death penalty should not be given to any government the death penalty exists for the primary purpose of controlling criminally notorious people but the threat of the imposition of the death penalty is the ultimate threat
913884 there are other ways to protect ourselves from the murderers of say north ossetia and the caucasus region and from the saddam husseins of the world we may imprison them without contact with the outside world for the rest of their lives i think that the former soviet republics recognized this when nearly all either abolished the death penalty or imposed a de jure or de facto moratorium on its use
913885 countries who wish to participate in the council of europe or have relations with the european union and the osce for example may freely decide to enhance human rights or forego the benefits of membership
913886 every execution is an affront to human dignity and a grave abuse of human rights the world is steadily turning against capital punishment
913887 these countries have realised the risks inherent in the use of the death penalty
913888 it can be used against those innocent of the crime for which they were condemned and it is often used after unfair trials or disproportionately against ethnic minorities the poor or other disadvantaged groups
913889 nothing that we are aware of prevents russia from abolishing the death penalty
913890 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is

913920 as we were sitting one day before the messenger of allah peace and blessings be upon him a man suddenly appeared
913921 islam is to bear witness that there is no god but god and that muhammad is the messenger of god and to perform the prayer pay zakat fast ramadan and to perform hajj to the house if you are able
913922 it is to believe in allah his angels his books his messengers the last day and in destiny its good and bad
913923 you have spoken the truth now tell me about spiritual excellence ihsan
913924 it is to serve allah as though you behold him and if you dont behold him know that he surely sees you
913925 the one asked knows no more of it than the one asking
913926 that slave women give birth to their mistresses and that you see barefoot unclothed beginning shepherds competing in the construction of tall buildings
913927 it was jibril he came to you to teach you your religion
913928 when the destitute al buhm camelherds compete in building tall structures
913929 when the barefoot and the naked are the top leaders lit
913930 you shall see the barefoot naked indigent al la shepherds compete in building tall structures
913931 when the naked and barefoot are the top leaders of the people
913932 when you see that the barefoot and naked the deaf and dumb are the kings of the earth
913933 one of the signs of the change of the religion is the affectation of eloquence by the rabble and their betaking to palaces in big cities

914016 i have faced death at the hands of my government and im here to tell the international community of the human suffering caused by the death penalty and to urge them to end this terrible punishment
914017 its difficult to describe what it is like to serve time on death row knowing you are innocent
914018 all you know is that what seems like an awful nightmare is now reality a reality beyond comprehension the us death penalty system is broken what happened to me can happen to anyone and it doesnt have to be that way
914019 living each day knowing that you may be sent to your death at any given month day or moment is torture
914020 being on death row dehumanises and has a massive psychological effect on a person its an awful penalty to inflict on anyone and is even more devastating for someone who is innocent
914021 these three men provide graphic evidence that the death penalty is administered by flawed systems whatever the culture and resources of the country concerned no one knows how many innocent men and women have been executed through history but the ever present risk of executing the innocent provides yet another compelling reason why the time has come for the global moratorium of executions
914022 low grade pop therapy analysis that passes for thinking nowadays in educated circles
914023 found it made me consider my own life in many ways
914024 and then think about how many of those people would willingly sit through a speech by gordon brown or david cameron on national security
914025 it was cruel and inhuman the legal systems in even the wealthiest nations are incapable of providing justice when it comes to capital punishment afghanistan certainly cant
914026 i confirmed the condemned prisoners matched the photographs in their files
914027 but one was already missing he had taken refuge among another group of prisoners in a different wing who put up resistance when we tried to get him back
914028 it took between 5 and 10 minutes for them to kill everybody
914029 then we went to look for timur shah we searched over a mile radius but found nothing

914033 theres a lot of momentum strategies behind the growth style
914034 and the stocks that had the momentum going into the first half of this year were those focused on basic materials and commodities but the momentum dried up as worries over the u s economy and housing market rose
914035 when you see them up at two in the morning talking or crying or sharing gossip were right there with them
914036 id say i became like a big sister to some of them
914037 when they were having a problem i was certainly willing to provide advice i hope it was good advice
914038 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
914039 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
914040 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
914041 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
914042 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
914043 obama your favorite columnist wrestles with pennsylvania candidates for public office
914044 im doing a full circle im coming back to performing after many years of taking a bit of a hiatus
914045 usually its the other way around im working towards becoming a waiter eventually thats my goal it may sound silly
914046 its a different form of expression too writing for yourself and its something id always wanted to do theres a lot of risk involved but im having a blast to be honest with you
914047 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
914048 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
914049 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
914050 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
914051 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
914052 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
914053 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
914054 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
914055 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
914056 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
914057 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
914058 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
914059 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
914060 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
914061 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
914062 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
914063 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
914064 they force you to maintain the property at a standard thats higher than the one for homeowners
914065 the cities are shouldered with the financial cost when they receive a complaint from a neighbor
914066 to go in abate the problem and tack the cost on to the tax bill
914067 we have inspectors out there now inspecting every neighborhood in the city and identifying every property
914068 are owned by lenders and we are having a difficult time of getting them to step up to the plate
914069 its just natural for them they dont realize that its perceived to be disrespectful
914070 occasionally on accident i throw one in an email at work
914071 we dont feel emoticons have a place in any formal communications
914072 should sit down at their computer in a thoughtful way and do it not while theyre on their way somewhere
914073 you dont even have time to digest the meeting and youre getting a thank you note
914074 im not his friend im not even his employer i was somebody who interviewed him
914075 i definitely text my managers if i am running late
914076 i know im not bothering them with a phone call but theyre still getting the message
914077 text messages are much more short and to the point
914078 it puts a face to the name because it shows your profile picture
914079 im spending way more time on this than i should
914080 its gotten way way worse especially in the last year or two
914081 every single thing we buy has little neon blue flashing lights on it turn the light off and they shine like beacons
914082 whoever sees that glow through my window must think im keeping aliens in my spare room
914083 my doctor told me i was a happy meal away from diabetes
914084 the times demand a radical new phase new labour won three elections by offering real change not just in policy but in the way we do politics we must do so again

914087 there will be a telephone call today between jalili and solana
914088 negotiations are an ongoing process and the question of deadline is media speculation
914089 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
914090 today mr jalili will talk over the phone with mr solana
914091 when it comes to our inalienable rights we will press ahead
914092 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
914093 when it comes to sanctions experience shows that it is ineffective especially when it comes to the nuclear issue
914094 of course in the event of a possible war we will aim to prolong its duration so as to be able to take advantage of all our missile and non missile capabilities
914095 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
914096 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
914097 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
914098 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
914099 er det ikke flott at en intens eu motstander ser at et forpliktende samarbeid kan brukes til noe han mener er fornuftig
914100 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
914101 there have been changes bit by bit but they are too slow
914102 death penalty reforms will lead the way for improved procedures for other major criminal cases
914103 so you have the return of an important piece of review
914104 but youre reviewing a system that is still politicized that still does not welcome independent judges and where lawyers raising questions about abuse or torture are being harassed and beaten up
914105 wir schauen uns um in bereichen des online marketings die wir noch nicht abdecken
914106 wir sehen bei radio fernsehen und print verluste und bei online wachstum
914107 wenn man ein gutes portal betreiben will muss man keine gro e online redaktion haben
914108 man sollte die inhalte nehmen die gut und auf dem markt verf gbar sind
914109 die vermarktung von sozialen netzwerken steckt noch in den kinderschuhen aber ber die masse der zugriffe auf die seiten lassen sich auch hohe erl se erzielen
914110 solarstrom war immer eine eingeschr nkte zeitlich weit entfernte l sung jetzt k nnen wir anfangen ernsthaft ber unbegrenzten solarstrom nachzudenken

914113 nicht jeder anbieter hat wie google auch die entsprechende kapazit ten f r solche services
914114 its necessary for bereaved families of crime victims and the public to know and understand if capital punishment is carried out properly and solemnly
914115 i wonder if theres a way to automatically proceed with the execution of death row inmates without the involvement of the justice minister
914116 well basicly i like to have a laugh and have a good time when im out with my m8s im a bit shy from the start but when u really get to know me properly u would really get to like me
914117 the moroccan media has not yet made abolition part of its agenda
914118 we have a long history of support for the death penalty from all quarters political social and religious
914119 the moroccan independent press has been showing enough daring on other issues
914120 crucial role in the democratic changes taking place in the country
914121 abolition is an integral part of this on going democratic transition in the country
914122 there was a thoroughgoing debate at this time between the abolitionists and advocates of the death penalty
914123 some people seem to be perpetually on a short fuse
914124 short term we raise social costs until elites agree to implement our demands or end policies we oppose longer term we accumulate support and develop movement infrastructure and alternative institutions while working toward transforming societys defining relations
914125 there is considerable violence likely during the whole preparatory series of struggles leading up to the actual final seizure of power but the seizure itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful
914126 the seizure of power itself and the following period of construction will likely be relatively peaceful
914127 our officials in our missions in thailand and afghanistan have succeeded after series of negotiations to get their death sentences commuted to prison terms
914128 they will soon be transferred to nigeria to serve their terms in various prisons in the country
914129 in some of these countries that serve as transit countries some 60 migrants including men women and children live in one small room controlled by people known as action men
914130 one of the most striking features of the national health service is the continual deafening chorus of complaint which rises day and night from every part of it a chorus only interrupted when someone suggests that a different system altogether might be preferable which would involve the money coming from some less literally palpable source the universal exchequer financing of the service endows everyone providing as well as using it with a vested interest in denigrating it so that it presents what must be the unique spectacle of an undertaking that is run down by everyone engaged in it
914131 encountering the divine is one of the most powerful experiences associated with high level ayahuasca inebriation

914134 this cyber demonstration has shown the publics growing interest in online free expression we urge internet users to continue protesting against the different forms of online censorship imposed by 15 governments in particular

914136 after boarding an air france flight to stockholm they took my passport and asked me to refer to the presidential office department for passport affairs after 72 hours to take it back
914137 the only reason for this move is to prevent me from taking part in the ceremony i think this is unreasonable
914138 i always ask myself what happened that within a few months it was suddenly bad for me to ride a bicycle as a girl i was thrown out of school for not wanting to wear a headscarf
914139 yes it can through the artful hands of the sculptor if rodin could make his sculptured man move his muscles why cant a stone be made to move its vocal chords
914140 i extend my solidarity to all artists whose work is threatened by violent people who hold different beliefs
914141 songs that werent good enough to be on the album cobbled together with some remixes and field recordings of cardiffs indie scene
914142 we are blessed with having an incredibly supportive record label in wichita

914144 despite hold on now youngster being only 5 or so months old we wanted to emphasise that this is no post album cash in

914157 blytown adalah sebuah tempat yang belum diketahui adanya tapi tempat ini menurut sebagian orang dianggap ada karena tempat ini memberi dampak secara langsung pada manusia

914181 karena hidupnya terlalu sempurna natasya tidak pernah merasakan kesedihan dan kepedihan bahkan yang dirasakan orang lain sekalipun
914182 mimpi itulah yang membuatnya merasakan kesedihan dan kepedihan yang selama ini tidak pernah ia rasakan dan semua itu membuat ia gila sampai sekarang
914183 aku selalu berpikir kalau natasya itu tidak gila aku mempercayai semua yang ia katakan

914193 for weighty reasons it has been assumed as a principle in constitutional construction by the supreme court of the united states by this court and every other court of reputation in the united states that an act of the legislature is not to be declared void unless the violation of the constitution is so manifest as to leave no room for reasonable doubt
914194 the political experience and the moral education and stimulus that comes from fighting the question out in the ordinary way and correcting their own errors
914195 to dwarf the political capacity of the people and to deaden its sense of moral responsibility
914196 the court must presume that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds

914231 research shows that children being able to encounter and manage risk for themselves when they are playing gives them the fun they need but also instils important life skills like confidence and physical ability
914232 children are able to assess for themselves the level of risk nobody is advocating putting children in serious harms way but a certain amount of freedom is extremely important
914233 most adults tell us they had a lot more when they were growing up and that it did them good and that the occasional accident really was part of growing up
914234 if we minimise any chance of children hurting themselves at all we are actually depriving them of a very very important part of growing up
914235 research has shown that families forced to live in homes that are unfit for their needs suffer tremendously under the strain
914236 already there are many families stuck in this appalling predicament and the number is likely to soar across the nation as more families finances begin to buckle under the weight of the credit crisis
914237 building new adequate homes will take time but thats no reason not to start now
914238 the need for social housing is already high and it is likely to increase day by day many families are at risk of a miserable and insecure future thats why we must take action

914240 this is the first time in a generation that the council has considered building homes which marks a major shift in strategy and defining council housing in the 21st century

914242 the federation very much welcomes the prospect of building council housing in edinburgh once again this is something the federation has sought for a very long time in the present housing crisis new council housing is desperately needed
914243 we look forward to learning the details about what would be involved in making this happen

914258 it is quite clear that many women are becoming trapped in the vicious cycle of hidden homelessness
914259 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflects the failure of the state to understand this complex problem
914260 women are at far greater risk of having to compromise between their own safety and their need to find a place to sleep
914261 it is alarming that in the extreme the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation
914262 we will work with the many great organisations helping the homeless to try to find solutions however sadly a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
914263 shes not going to apologise because it makes up for things ive done to her in the past
914264 theres a big policy debate we should be having in addition to talking about the leadership
914265 im not alone in finding the timing of this leak and these articles all a little suspicious it looks like a calculated attempt by a handful of ultra blairites to damage and divide the party at the very time we should be uniting behind gordon brown to deal with the nations problems
914266 junked the tb tony blair policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
914267 no doubt that gordon brown is the right person for the job
914268 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some people backing brown and others trying to knife him
914269 what we have is a government in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges
914270 we simply cant go on like this for another 18 months we need a general election sooner rather than later

914273 i saw a number of neighbours kicking at the door trying to get it open
914274 there was lots of commotion people screaming theres a child in there youve got to get the child out
914275 i could see the baby was very pink so obviously badly burned
914276 he was so calm really really calm compared to what had happened to him
914277 i heard an argument taking place and i thought it was my neighbours because it sounded so close
914278 it was an argument with a young girl and i heard forceful banging on the door and i heard her crying help help help let me out
914279 so i looked out of my window but it was dark and i could not see anything
914280 a girl cried out theres a baby trapped in there and i saw three men trying to break down the door with a baseball bat
914281 i have never heard a woman screaming so much she was hitting that door really really hard it sounded like she was trapped
914282 we were coming back from getting a beer when we heard this scream and we saw a man run across the road with a crow bar
914283 we heard there was a baby up there and it was instant you dont think we just went to help
914284 i tried to follow him in but the smoke was too much so i had to turn back and i went next door because people were saying we should get wet towels
914285 we got towels and it was then that the fire crew arrived it happened so quickly and it has just felt like a rollercoaster ever since
914286 you see things like this on tv but you dont believe it happens
914287 they arrived in february and they always had arguments sometimes until two in the morning
914288 they were always arguing and i had tried to speak to her about it
914289 we do employment evaluations in which we do criminal record checks and child abuse registry and none of the references gave any indication that he was not a person to be trusted
914290 she was younger than vincent and a very kind very gentle individual
914291 like everyone else i think her response is surprise and shock all of us who had known the family i dont know that anyone could have seen this coming there was nothing predictable about it
914292 she is shocked and very much afraid as to what this is going to mean to her own life
914293 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was very committed to doing it well and really there was nothing that would cause him to stand out in any way
914294 ive been a thorn in their side for quite some time they thought id just drop by the wayside

914452 at the behest of mayor daleys former law partner a city council committee agreed monday to extend until 2040 a franchise agreement that has allowed a private company to tear up loop streets to install the chilled water pipeline needed to cool downtown office buildings
914453 that will give mde thermal technologies the company that acquired northwind years ago the stability it needs to attract more clients mde is owned by australia based macquarie the company that paid the city 1 83 billion over 99 years to lease the chicago skyway
914454 mde was represented at mondays transportation committee meeting by jack george a partner in the law firm of daley amp george michael daley the mayors brother is a partner in the firm
914455 the law firm stands to reap lucrative legal fees over the course of the longer franchise agreement
914456 daley amp george once employed the mayor and paid him until 1991 under a buyout agreement reached in 1980 when he was elected states attorney
914457 george said the unprecedented extension is needed to ensure that more than 100 existing customers and all of our potential new customers understand that the environmentally friendly cooling system is gonna be available for the long term future when we enter into these contracts with these various people
914458 transportation committee chairman tom allen 38th countered when you see that the use agreement changes from expiring in 2020 to 2040 it raises some eyebrows
914459 he asked mde president david bump to justify it some more
914460 its in our interest ours as well as the citys to have this system committed for the long term so people will utilize it

914484 wanted our officers to set a good example for others to follow
914485 it would be difficult for us to enforce a law if we violate it
914486 after the law went into effect i overheard some officers saying yeah but were exempt
914487 we made sure that they realized that the only exemption was for emergency business and nevertheless it set a negative image having officers on a cell phone when the public is prohibited
914488 their first reactions were thats not fair and why is it ok for police and not the rest of us
914489 can i take down their car number and report them
914490 there are a million and one reasons why officers need cell phones
914491 without them they would have to go into the station over and over again thereby taking them off the street

914680 i saw a white spot in the clouds absolutely close all the clouds paused then the white spot departed and stood all the time like a board in the sky on the same board or the screen or stage now images as quick as a flash followed each other about 10 000 in half an hour god himself occurred the witch who created the world in between worldly visions images of war continents memorials castles beautiful castles just the glory of the world but all of this to see in supernal images they were at least twenty meters big clear to observe almost without color like photographs the images were epiphanies of the last judgment christ couldnt fulfill the salvation because he was crucified early god revealed them to me to accomplish the salvation
914681 for years louis wains cats decorated our hoardings adorned the covers of magazines and were familiarly loved by every child and the majority of grown ups no christmas calendar was complete without this artist no annual was issued that did not contain one of his vivid sketches and yet at the age of 65 he is so bereft of means that in his affliction he is compelled to accept the hospitality of a state institution
914682 louis wain was not one of those men who take no thought for the morrow his history is one of the tragedies which rouse our deepest feelings of commiseration for years he made a fair income but with a lack of business acumen so often allied to genius when he sold his drawings he parted with them outright thus receiving no payment when they were reproduced over and over again
914683 though he was a prolific worker the war 1914 1918 put an end to his means of livelihood as public demand changed in favour of khaki as against cats such publications as were still devoted to louis wain reproduced those of his drawings which had already been paid for
914684 by this means louis wains resources dwindled and though for a time he made a little money by cinema cartoons he gradually found himself penniless and without employment a period of intense privation added to the mental strain and bewilderment at finding himself in such a position precipitated a breakdown in 1923 he was admitted as a pauper to the asylum where he has been ever since
914685 louis wain is not a violent lunatic he is now what he has always been gentle unassuming humorous and able at times to use his pencil and reproduce his beloved cats but there are periods of darkness when he knows no one at such periods one feels acutely that he should have everything that money can provide
914686 not everyone in an asylum is necessarily insane perhaps just tormented

914699 life has to be an incessant process of repair and reconstruction of discarding evil and developing goodness in the journey of life if you want to travel without fear you must have the ticket of a good conscience
914700 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqi is alive
914701 she is injured but alive and she is in afghanistan
914702 but when it suits their purpose to advertise that they are cooperative with the us intelligence all too often someone of high profile is revealed to have been captured and turned over
914703 if she is in us custody they want to know where she is
914704 who has got her and does she need medical care

914707 nou ja ik heb zon dildo gekocht en een verkoper daar heeft me erbij geholpen een man best wel een gek een idee hij deed er heel normaal over
914708 ik wist niet goed welke ik moest hebben dus dat vroeg ik hem hij liet me gewoon alle soorten maten en modellen zien ik ook heel normaal doen enzo en nu heb ik hem thuis een grote paarse
914709 nou eeehhhh nee ik kan er niks mee worden voorlangs achterlangs staan zitten liggen op mn knie n ik moet dat ding steeds vasthouden wat een gedoe hij is eigenlijk te groot
914710 neuh kweet niet hij ligt in de kast nu misschien kan ik hem nog eens weggeven hihi maar hoe groot is die van jou eigenlijk
914711 waarom wil je dat weten de grootte is toch niet belangrijk het gaat toch om die andere lul die er aan vast zit
914712 10 cm ofzo was het heel klein in ieder geval
914713 ow nou die van mij is gewoon normaal denk ik ik heb em nooit echt gemeten
914714 ja eehhhh dat gaat zomaar niet hij hangt er nu bij als een slappe vaatdoek 5 cm ofzo ben jij nu geil ofzo
914715 ik ben hem wel weer eens tegengekomen in uniform ik heb net gedaan alsof ik hem niet herkende
914716 ik meet hem wel eventjes van de week als ik weer naar vieze plaatjes kijk als je het dan pers wilt weten
914717 what is my part in not getting my wishes honored by my mate
914718 man will become better when you show him what he is like
914719 its everything we had wished for the dogs have been fantastic and the people were great with their dogs
914720 he was hiding under a blanket and i said boy youre acting ferocious and he growled he really is the worlds sweetest dog though
914721 we like to take her to shows and events so people can see what a true pit bull looks like
914722 the stigma that comes along with a pit bull it really is how theyre raised
914723 im overwhelmed at how great this town is at coming out and forming a community im so grateful to live in a town that comes together like this
914724 if you live here you should probably be aware of the closures
914725 hopefully things will pick up though thats the way i see it things are bound to pick up
914726 you will be astonished to know about the activities of dr afia
914727 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of your daughters disappearance
914728 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continues to haunt those who heard her
914729 she rented a post office box to help a former resident of baltimore named majid khan alleged al qaeda suspect to help establish his us identity
914730 support appeal for dr afia siddiqi prisoner 650 bagram jail gt
914731 dont worry the cows will be out by the time i come
914732 the only school that made it hard for me was illinois
914733 i talked to illinois coach ron zook on the phone and they recruited me the second hardest and thats what i really looked at in the beginning who was recruiting me the hardest i was going to look at them the hardest
914734 iowa sent me personal letters every day theyve been sending me a whole bunch of stuff theyve invited me to a bunch of stuff ive been to iowa over a dozen times probably
914735 theyve told me where ill be and i feel like ill fit into that program ill play their x receiver thats usually the guy thats the playmaker on single receiver sides and theyll let me make plays
914736 hes got good size good hands and hes the kind of guy that iowa definitely needs on offense because it looked like they were lacking running backs and wide receivers last year hes similar to adrian arrington almost identical to me not elite speed guys but real good hands and good athletes
914737 i knew who erik was and when he first came to iowa i visited with him went in and had a conference with him
914738 hes a great guy a really outgoing guy and i really liked him
914739 iowa was the no 1 place i was looking at just because of the fact i always wanted to go there since i was a little kid
914740 i want to be part of a national championship team and be around great people and have the atmosphere thats going to help me wrestle at the next level
914741 thats what makes him a good freestyle wrestler and thats whats going to help him in the college room obviously hes going to have to get a little more physical but his style isnt to be real physical and im not sure thats going to bother him a whole lot hes got toughness and hes been in a room with guys like grant gambrall and nate moore and nick moore and dylan carew so hes not afraid of working hard and getting pushed in the practice room
914742 you cant teach some of those things that he does
914743 he might have stepped up and got to the front of the line with a couple of kids going to other places
914744 the bottom line is he wants to be a hawkeye and thats what theyre looking for
914745 hes had a very good july and shot the ball real well
914746 eric is very passionate about the game and pretty much outworks anybody ive ever seen
914747 hes very versatile both as a wing and forward and thats what coach lickliter wants guys who can play different positions
914748 hes a tough kid both physically and mentally with good athleticism and hes a proven winner i think theyre getting a good kid with eric
914749 i think they feel theyve got to add some toughness on the floor
914750 theyre going to have a lot of three guard offenses theyre always going to have three guards on the floor in todds system eric can shoot the three and he can defend two to three positions on the perimeter
914751 in discussions with both governments i will cover matters of mutual interest including the response to the breakdown in the world trade organisation doha round of negotiations global financial uncertainty regional architecture and climate change mr rudd said
914752 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world he said
914753 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
914754 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
914755 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
914756 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
914757 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
914758 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
914759 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
914760 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
914761 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
914762 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
914763 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
914764 about right and 28 per cent thought they were not tough enough
914765 absolute claims which could be at risk of breaching the trade practices act if the fairtrade certification process was not 100 per cent reliable
914766 fairtrade aims to give farmers and producers a much fairer deal and we strongly believe in that she said
914767 fairtrade does not serve the interests of the poor director of the institutes free trade unit tim wilson said
914768 this will involve those serious breaches not for minor things like forgetting to close a lid on a rubbish bin but serious breaches of licence conditions as well as prosecutions
914769 i would hope that in the future we have no one in the list
914770 ku believes that this initiative will assist parents when making the important decision about who will care for their children
914771 todays announcement will do nothing to get more children into preschool or reduce the fees faced by struggling families
914772 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
914773 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
914774 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
914775 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
914776 whatever the reason for the movement of the pregnant mother one must have grave concerns that the child will not be born into a better life but taken from the mother and forced into a life of exploitation which may also be quite short mr pascoe said
914777 this is an issue which goes to our own humanity he said
914778 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time she said
914779 our sympathy goes out to the family following this tragic death
914780 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
914781 wet sand as we have had today after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
914782 the quinn family regards these shareholdings in anglo irish bank as long term holdings with significant opportunity for capital growth over such a period
914783 he probably sees something of his own entrepreneurial style in anglos management
914784 an extremely serious blunder by mary harney and her department in the interpretation of their own legislation
914785 without risk equalisation there is a danger that new entries to the health insurance market will simply cherry pick customers with a view to maximising profits this cannot be allowed to happen
914786 if community rating were to be affected they would be the biggest losers
914787 most of the irish property deals are bank guaranteed and lawyers for larionovo have been in contact with legal representatives of the spanish developer
914788 the company laid off a few people since january but it is still very busy in the dubai market where it employs 122 people everyone knows there are problems in both the domestic and overseas property markets
914789 it could lead to a situation where the cost of private health insurance is prohibitive at a time when public health services for older people are inadequate
914790 i am not certain at this point that there is a quick legal fix and i want to make that clear
914791 if there were i would be advocating a recall of the d il to deal with that
914792 it would not be possible to have insurance affordable to older and sick people if younger people were not paying that little bit more
914793 we have taken this decision in the light of the extraordinary change in the economic climate over recent months
914794 we felt it would be imprudent to proceed at this point in time and rather than have uncertainty we felt it would be in the best interests of both parties to inform clontarf now
914795 we would like to put on record our sincere thanks for the way in which clontarf has worked with us during this time
914796 my oil trader friends my gold trader friends stock traders
914797 theyve been working out all summer inoke has played for three years well have them ready for the florida game
914798 dana is the best in the game he helped us a lot and he gave us some really good ideas
914799 because of the experience ive had in miami i know the humidity will be a factor we have to deal with were going to work in that direction were going to start over hydrating our guys on the first day of camp well teach them how to battle the humidity
914800 mcmackin said all of the offensive and defensive concepts will be implemented in the next two weeks starting aug 18 the warriors will work specifically on plays that will be used against florida
914801 funaki excelled in spring training and is regarded as a threat on rollouts
914802 i know i can ease into that role if i see something wrong im not going to keep it to myself
914803 i saw him rush the quarterback almost getting him before he threw the ball guess who made the play downfield im not talking about a little screen pisa ran down and made the tackle that was amazing
914804 they keep going and going its not a matter of one two oops im blocked these two have a great motor that never stops until the play is over
914805 veikune was listed as a reserve last season but he actually tallied the most plays of all of the defensive ends he was named to the all wac first team
914806 hes a noga type guy hell make big plays because hes athletic
914807 for a change of scenery kelly worked out at san francisco states soccer stadium there are six staircases on each sideline stands he raced up and down each one then sprinted to the other side and sprinted and down those stairs he started by doing five cycles each day by the end of the month he was up to seven cycles he also participated in weight sessions designed to improve his lower body strength the 6 foot 3 kelly now weighs 225 he was 180 at the end of the 2005 training camp at the snap hold kick competition in fontana calif kelly won the long drive award with a 59 yard field goal and was second in the kicking contest making 9 of 10 field goal attempts
914808 i know all the coaches are excited to get on the field and get started i looked at our calendar and weve leaving on the 26th of this month its just like oh my gosh weve got to start going its going to be so fast
914809 i felt pretty good after spring im anxious to see where were at when we start on monday we have a lot of spots open and thats what im anxious to start looking at
914810 these past six months have been fast and fun ive really enjoyed meeting the people speaking at things getting to know everybody ive enjoyed meeting with the coaches spring ball everything weve done weve done a lot of things in the past six months im really proud of my staff and our players ive been meeting a lot of people of hawaii
914811 not really its been good to get the family here shannon my daughter is coming in august because the animals are still in quarantine the horse is here another animal is finishing up quarantine they have three dogs and one cat we have one cat and they have a horse we found a really nice place for them so everythings really set that way we havent really been able to get away or anything but that will happen later on theres too much to do to get away now
914812 you know im excited about it but to me im doing the same thing ive done for a lot of my career there are just more kids involved weve got a good system ive got a great athletic director its been a pretty good transition ive wanted to be a head coach at the division i level its a blessing because not only do i get to live in the best place but ive got good coaches ive got a lot of respect for the players weve got great fans and the administrations been very supportive summer school for the players getting video equipment thats up to date the money is there for the practice field
914813 ive always believed in practicing pro style i believe you have to practice full speed youll remember in spring we were in full pads often you need to practice full speed because you practice how you play i still want to protect them we lost karl noa last year with a shoulder injury when we went out with just helmets its important we save their legs too as far as practice goes everythings going to be full speed no tackle i feel were a good tackling team well always work on tackling fundamentals offensive blocking its all not to the ground when you go to the ground thats when you have guys falling on each other and hurting each other knees even our one on ones well go full speed in pads or shells but we dont go to the ground thats the key in the games you go to the ground i believe in a lot of reps were going to get a lot of reps everything we do is a system so we need to get a lot of reps the more reps we get the better were going to be were an attacking package offensively were attacking were going to be a big play offense and on defense were looking to make plays make big plays offensively and defensively its what youve heard me say before defensively the big things are tackles for loss interceptions sacks im not as concerned about yardage it depends how much somebody has the ball scoring and keeping the opponents score down but im not a big yards guy
914814 obviously our veterans are back on defense we lost some good players but we really have all of our starters back on defense even though we lost some good players offensively we lost some quality players i think the strength of our offense is the offensive line i think john estes is one of the top centers in the country he makes us so much better because he sees things and calls things guard is more of a natural position for keith ahsoon keoni steinhoff was excellent last year hes a solid good player we want to get more players in the game as we did on defense last year we want to get eight or more offensive linemen who play in a ballgame we want to always play our best players not just because a guys a nice kid we want to play more receivers in a game because their legs will go if theyre running full speed the whole game if a guy can help us win the game were going to get him in the game at a certain point and in the fourth quarter were a lot better
914815 our slots i really feel good about theyve been there three years and adding kealoha pilares to them aaron bain made catches all over the place against us in practice these guys arent bad they know the offense and can make plays ryan henry will be special and dustin blount and jovonte taylor can flat out run
914816 every team has its own personality thats why after last thursday im not wearing this 2007 wac championship ring that was last years team this years team our saying is be humble and be hungry thats what this years team has to do what people dont realize they dont think much of us theres a coaching change we lost a lot of players is that weve still got a large portion of our team is defending champions i think theres a great confidence the other thing is its a large senior class a lot of leaders three goals graduate 100 percent win the wac every year go to a bowl game thats what the players say theyre going to win the wac
914817 i look at us as a team really getting better the first three games and then we have a bye its really important that we get better make decisions and then go into the wac i look at us really getting better every week weve already in the spring worked on weber state and oregon state it doesnt matter who were playing when we get our base packages in then well start working on florida we worked on them a little bit in the spring were practicing to get our packages in on all three phases of our game then we start game planning after that
914818 we played six quarterbacks under center and john wasnt there thats regular football the offense really moved the ball and played well the last two weeks of spring i have complete confidence in our coaches and personnel were going to be an attacking offense and a big play offense
914819 i think our special teams are really solid weve got the best snapper in the country weve got one of the best kickers dan kelly a punter thats very good and a bunch of returners the offensive line we have three starters back the other two positions are wide open three guys going for left tackle two for guard quarterbacks wide open running back really everythings open when guys show they can play the game competition is what makes you better even at middle linebacker weve got to find a way to get brashton satele on the field outside backer just like we did with brad kalilimoku last year and i did with those guys in san francisco rest solly elimimian play him outside and rest adam leonard its more finding the two best at each position and then playing the best player
914820 i think were really sitting good weve got keao monteilh and desmond thomas e rob erik robinson and the guy silva mana silva i was really impressed kenny estes he had a good spring and hes a smart kid and vili hes in the mix dane porlas too since ive been here its the most talented group of corners weve had ryan mouton and jameel dowling a 6 3 corner who can run hes quick smart j p jopierre davis and calvin roberts i feel like we have depth at corner for the first time
914821 i was thinking of the dorm but the players bond by staying together were going to stay in the dance studio at first way back it was a financial thing this puts them all on the same level
914822 i think hes an outstanding player every time im making adjustments in practice hes getting a big gain i think hell be one of the top backs in the wac he and daniel libres a changeup then we got a couple of power backs id like to have one or two guys be the guys i dont want to be predictable and i dont want to play a bunch of guys to play a bunch of guys
914823 you have to stay calm ive found if youre a crazy guy on the sideline you dont know whats going on if you lose it arguing with the refs you dont call the game as well of course its different when im talking to the team before the game or at halftime thats my responsibility get the team ready the whole team ready
914824 omg that chick is looking at me does she think im fat am i fat omg can she see my rolls comming out of my pants is my hair not right do i have something in my teeth
914825 kita sudah tetapkan tiga tersangka andi tandra wahab dan cholidi

914830 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
914831 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
914832 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said
914833 if there was somebody else in it we might take that to be a healthy challenge and we always welcome a healthy challenge
914834 the quinn family regards these shareholdings in anglo irish bank as long term holdings with significant opportunity for capital growth over such a period
914835 in recent years we have been highly impressed with anglos ability to out perform the banking sector in terms of profit growth and we are confident this trend can be maintained over the longer term notwithstanding the current difficulties being experienced in international banking
914836 obama your favorite columnist wrestles with pennsylvania candidates for public office
914837 persistently used funds and employees of citizens alliance for their personal and political benefit
914838 its a deliciously entertaining document that should be read by every political science student in america
914839 absolutely a pennsylvania statute provides for it its in their right to pay the legal bills for people who are being sued because of activities in connection to the charities
914840 to me theres a difference between paying for some suit thats in ones service to the organization that has been approved by the board and another in paying legal bills due to the unilateral taking of the assets
914841 the board had an independent attorney validate the hiring of our firm in the matter
914842 it wouldnt be appropriate to say anything about a case thats going to trial in five weeks
914843 would seek restoration of any assets that may have been taken
914844 im doing a full circle im coming back to performing after many years of taking a bit of a hiatus
914845 usually its the other way around im working towards becoming a waiter eventually thats my goal it may sound silly
914846 its a different form of expression too writing for yourself and its something id always wanted to do theres a lot of risk involved but im having a blast to be honest with you
914847 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
914848 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
914849 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
914850 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
914851 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
914852 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
914853 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
914854 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
914855 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
914856 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
914857 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
914858 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
914859 when you see them up at two in the morning talking or crying or sharing gossip were right there with them
914860 id say i became like a big sister to some of them
914861 when they were having a problem i was certainly willing to provide advice i hope it was good advice
914862 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
914863 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
914864 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
914865 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
914866 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
914867 my doctor told me i was a happy meal away from diabetes

914909 in den naturparks ist die zahl der elefanten wieder gestiegen obwohl sie im gesamten land zur ckgeht

914937 in order to maximize the efficiency of our operations we have been developing initiatives to enhance the exploitation of economies of scale these include the use of longer trains in our railroads with 330 wagons and higher efficiency locomotives with on board computers and higher axle loads and the creation of a dedicated maritime shuttle service between brazil and asia where we expect most of the future growth of the global demand for iron ore to come from
914938 you can bet that rio tinto will take this very seriously and fight for its rights this is all very confusing
914939 a nuclear renaissance is at our door step and primary uranium production is well behind global demand and an increase in primary uranium is needed to feed tomorrows needs
914940 moreover the developing world is increasing demand for base metals via infrastructure development demand for vanadium used in steel products is increasing beyond primary production thus given these fundamentals there is long term stability for uranium and vanadium prices
914941 energy fuels is entering production at a key stage to maximize the advantage of concurrent global growth in energy demand and the rapid industrialization urbanization of the developing world
914942 industrialization and urbanization throughout the undeveloped world has lead to increases in demand for and price of steel additives such as vanadium concurrent growth in energy demand and commensurate concern on minimizing atmospheric emissions has led to a nuclear renaissance and the increase in uranium demand has created the long term appreciation in the uranium price
914943 there are few operations in the world that mine and extract uranium and vanadium and as such energy fuels plans to mine construct and operate the pi on ridge mill in colorado will take advantage of this rare market synergy
914944 such action provides exposure to two sectors with robust underlying demand fundamentals and thus this gives sustained metal price stability that further enhances resource value and diversifies risk
914945 but we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts

914969 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
914970 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
914971 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
914972 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis
914973 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
914974 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
914975 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
914976 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
914977 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
914978 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop

915000 still my favourite comedy adventure still hilarious and still demonstrating puzzle design that no one else has come close to which is shocking since this is now 350 years old and all predicated on the idea that if a tentacle grew stubby arms hed take over the world

915004 in response to further press speculation the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company

915021 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
915022 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
915023 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
915024 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
915025 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
915026 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
915027 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
915028 we dont have any evidence before us that qantas safety systems are not working or that there are links between these events or that there are any safety problems within qantas
915029 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
915030 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around

915046 should there be a significant release of water there will be a rapid increase in the volume depth and velocity of water in the maich water channel

915079 there are times when pietersen plays like an individual as when he got out on 94 at edgbaston

915105 imagine cup provides a forum for university students around the world to explore new ways to use the power of software to help address some of the worlds toughest problems

915109 once we rebuild our house and move back in i dont know what more we can do
915110 i dont think the university can do too much to prevent these kind of attacks i would like to see the citizens of santa cruz and our elected officials including the mayor step up and condemn this kind of violence
915111 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
915112 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
915113 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
915114 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking

915121 after the law went into effect i overheard some officers saying yeah but were exempt
915122 we made sure that they realized that the only exemption was for emergency business and nevertheless it set a negative image having officers on a cell phone when the public is prohibited
915123 their first reactions were thats not fair and why is it ok for police and not the rest of us
915124 can i take down their car number and report them
915125 there are a million and one reasons why officers need cell phones
915126 without them they would have to go into the station over and over again thereby taking them off the street
915127 im too old to come to this institution and sit on my hands for 15 years before i make a peep
915128 thats not my personality thats not my style and thats not why i was elected by the people in my district

915148 there can be no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court to interfere where it is satisfied that its process is being used for an indirect or improper purpose
915149 in my view it is arguable that improper motives are a relevant matter depending on the circumstances in considering whether criminal proceedings before magistrates are an abuse of process this is not necessarily a matter of mixed motives of the sort to which lloyd lj referred in the

915151 at a time where it appears that the bringing of private prosecutions is to be facilitated see law commission report no 255 consents to prosecution 1990 we do well to remind ourselves that a private prosecutor such as mr tivnan is still a prosecutor and subject to the same obligations as a minister of justice as are the public prosecuting authorities

915192 where the court makes a residence order in favour of any person who is not the parent or guardian of the child concerned that person shall have parental responsibility for the child while the residence order remains in force
915193 she feels that she has been preparing all her life to bring up h
915194 serve to perpetuate a deception and have consequences for hs relationship with his extended family and any future relationship with his biological father
915195 advantages to h in ensuring that the relationship with mr a continued via a shared residence arrangement although this may be premature given some of the other uncertainties in the situation
915196 h is already asking questions about daddy and who he addressed in this way explanation of mummies and daddies making children and mr cs role in this at a level that h can understand would seem appropriate this should be presented as an additional person in hs life rather than a replacement to mr a
915197 i have made my views clear about what i think about perpetuating a deception in the context of the legal view about a shared residence lots of people with no biological connection with children have shared residence orders without perpetuating a deception particularly if what might be termed a deception is explained sensibly and properly to a child in this case h
915198 in one respect mr a and the mother are as like as chalk and chalk that in respect of determination just as mr a has been determined to get his way the mother has been determined to carry on with her way as mr a would see it marginalising his position with h otherwise she is not the same obviously forceful character as mr a and one can see that she could find herself dominated by his strong and forceful personality perhaps she might feel i am not suggesting that mr a willingly attempts to control her but she might see herself as being controlled by him
915199 they have to learn to communicate in a meaningful way about their son it is essential that h needs a good relationship with his mother and his father for which miss a may want to read father figure he needs a rounded future a rounded future is achievable only with a father figure as well as a mother figure the mother figure will be the dominant figure but the father figure will be a significant person in his life it must be that is what he needs
915200 shared residence there are great advantages in a shared residence order which i shall come to in a moment it sends out the strong message that mrs r suggested and miss d agreed with about mr as position in hs life on the other hand miss d did suggest it would impinge these are my words not hers on mothers security it would affect mother as would parental responsibility which goes with it and that is something to put in the balance
915201 dealing with shared residence first of all mr as application mother objects strongly she experiences mr as exercise of his rights in relation to h as oppressive greatly in hs interest that the current war of attrition be ended and submitted make a shared residence order would serve to extend it miss probyn presented what i thought was a skilful argument relying on the authorities towards a shared residence order or a joint residence order she says that a joint residence order will not only provide mr a with parental responsibility by virtue of section 12 2 of the children act it would also reflect his position in hs life both in the past and future i am entirely with her on that there is clear authority for the grant of shared residence in circumstances where the law does not permit an order under section 4 of the act because as in this case h is not as it now appears the biological son of mr a at the time that the order was made by the court purportedly under section 4 of the act it was thought that he was but it transpires he is not in re h shared residence parental responsibility 1995 2 flr p 883 the court of appeal clearly stated that a shared residence order was an appropriate means of conferring parental responsibility upon a step father in the much more recent case of r g children 2005 ewca civ p 462 the court of appeal turned to the use of shared residence as a tool to ensure that the non biological parent shared parental responsibility for the child concerned the courts have emphasised in numerous cases the desirability of shared parental responsibility it is not the case as has been suggested by mrs r for example that conflict and parental acrimony are grounds to refuse to make an order for shared residence in a amp a shared residence 2004 1 flr 1195 wall j as he then was made a shared residence order against a background of tremendous conflict between the parents that resulted in frequent applications to the court miss probyn sets out an analysis of the grounds for a shared residence order set out at paragraph 12 of re g there is as she says a clear analogy between that case and this case certain headings identified by the cafcass officer in re g as set out in the judgment of thorpe lj are considered in the context of this case firstly excluding mr a would not be helpful to h when he is trying to understand his history and early life 2 a shared residence order will help h have a clear picture of where he fits in when he grows older 3 a joint residence order would work to specify in detail what arrangements there should be 4 it will help h to know that both parties are involved in his education 5 a joint residence order will require the mother to share information with mr a 6 a joint residence order will help h to understand where mr a fits in and to understand this better in years to come if an order give him a legal importance in his life 7 a joint residence order would encourage the parties to recognise the reality of hs early life so all these criteria apply however in this particular case there is one further different factor that is the effect on miss a of making a joint residence order it would have on this mother a disproportionately adverse affect which may rebound on h and that is my concern
915202 29 i am very much in favour of a joint residence order for the reasons already mentioned just now in the criteria but i do not propose to make an order now because i am concerned about the effect it would have on the mother i am not going to make an order at this stage for that reason but i want to keep the option open and we will look at it again in the case of a review i am expecting when the review comes round to examine closely the mothers behaviour and attitude towards this judgment if i find there has been a failure to heed my remarks in her attitude towards mr a and indeed to h that may well strengthen my resolve at the next hearing to make a joint residence order so i am putting it on ice for the moment concerned as i am for the mothers reaction to it but she has warning that it may well be coming if she does not co operate for hs benefit with mr a i reject as i have already said that a joint residence order would perpetuate a deception but that is not a factor in my mind 30 let me just say this in relation to joint residence i am making the order that i do on the basis that the mothers staying in the area and i find that for her to do so is in hs best interest in maintaining a relationship with mr a
915203 if it is a quid pro quo for my not making at this stage a joint residence order she may well find that would mean to secure protection from mr a from marginalisation in relation to h then there will be a joint residence order
915204 parental responsibility the existing order was made in error an error due to miss a it is an academic thing i am going to revoke the existing order with the possibility that for the same reason as the joint residence order it may be revived when i look at the situation it may be needed to protect mr a against any unilateral intention to marginalise him from h made in the mind of miss a
915205 this judgment should be read or heard in conjunction with that earlier judgment from which it follows on there are a number of issues now before me
915206 5 the first issue is the mothers application to relocate with h from her home locally to the south coast the reason she applies to the court is that i made it clear in my earlier judgment that it was in hs best interests that she should remain in the locality because of what i found was a real fear of mr a that moving out of the area to a distant location within england would make contact more difficult and might be seen by mr a at least as his marginalisation by the mother so she has to apply to the court as indeed she has done for permission to relocate to the south coast this is also the review hearing originally contemplated to be taking place in july 2006 in the original order 6 then there is the issue of shared residence which is strongly put forward by mr a because he wishes not in fact to have a significant share of hs time living with him in terms of equal or more or less equal division but he wishes to have parental responsibility restored to him again as he would put it so as to prevent the mother from marginalising him in his relationship with h 7 there is the third issue of contact which depends of course on whether the mother and h remain in their present location or whether they remove to the coast 8 there are issues abut hs surname which are put forward by mr a should he be known by the fathers or mothers surname there is also an issue raised by miss probyn in her skeleton argument concerning the introduction of mr c who is in fact hs biological father to h h knows of him but he has not met him how does that impact i must decide upon hs welfare at the moment
915207 the court has the option of ordering a continuation of the existing orders in that h lives with his mother and has contact with his father a further option would be to grant a residence order to mr a and a contact to the mother had mr a been hs biological father it would have been reasonable for the court to order shared residence as a reflection of the equal status and the responsibilities of the mother and mr a i would have no hesitation in recommending that that is the most appropriate outcome but as mr a is not the biological father i am not sure if this is possible there may by a precedent however to the court that confirms this is still feasible
915208 such a move would inevitably fracture hs ability to continue to develop a primary relationship with both his parents even if a generous contact regime was ordered or indeed agreed to subject the young child to extensive travel to facilitate contact would not be regarded as being desirable or appropriate he has the opportunity to continue to move between parents in a much closer proximity by staying in the area of his present home
915209 it is very important that he maintains what he likes and loves his best times so there can be no question of him losing his relationship with his father miss d supports continuation as does mr p
915210 he needs security he needs to know that life does not involve mr a and the mother in an antagonistic background he needs to feel secure emotionally with both of them
915211 that should reflect in her happiness her demeanour and in turn benefit h because it is hs welfare which is my paramount concern section 1 of the children act not to the parties best interests or welfare
915212 so far as the introduction of mr c is concerned that may well confuse h in a time of change which needs to be fraught with as little danger as possible as little change as possible with little concerns as possible which going to new schools going to a new area as proposed there will come a time when he needs to be introduced to mr c but it is after his position with mr a is entirely secure it seems to me that is what i find to be in hs best interest
915213 is at risk from suffering emotional damage as a result of the antagonism between the parties and i stress once more they must stop this antagonism and the best way of doing that in all the circumstances i have found is a move by h and his mother provided the level of contact and the enjoyable contact which h has with mr a is maintained
915214 41 that brings into question the possibility of making a shared residence order
915215 50 what i would like to know going further than the mother offers is the current pattern to continue during this coming school term there ought to be a period of adjustment in brighton i would like mr a to firm up his arrangements whatever they are once he has firmed up those arrangements he can have it seems to me the fortnightly contact provided it takes place in brighton or nearby not returning h to school in the autumn term but once the spring term starts he should be able to return h to school on the monday morning again not take him back to mr as home however half terms and school holidays he can go back to mr as home as it is the extended contact
915216 52 the mother of course was very anxious that mr a does not impose himself and his will upon every slightest detail parental responsibility means just that for mr a he has responsibilities not rights the mother is to remain the primary carer of h that means that day to day matters she may decide without reference to mr a some criticism is made of a lack of hair cut by mr p in his report but i do not expect now mr a has parental responsibility that he will be laying down the law to the mother about having hair cuts and minor detail and the mother can make preliminary arrangements on important matters such as change of school or an important operation if one is necessary which one hopes it is not but generally speaking the day to day care arrangements for h shall continue to be made by the mother where h is to live if there is to be a move and matters of significant importance are to be discussed with mr a and the parties are going to have to do their best to reach amicable agreement if there are such matters which will occasionally arise conflict is bad for h almost all the main functions o daily routine and decisions will be taken by the mother as before major issues will be discussed with mr a if when h is with mr a he needs to go to hospital or he needs to see a doctor his home address is to be given his home doctors references to be given nothing is to be done in that respect unilaterally by mr a but he can of course with responsibility take his child to the doctors or to casualty if something dreadful were to necessitate that
915217 they may gradually win more grudging approval from the courts if the judges begin to acknowledge that such orders can reflect practical arrangements made by parents and their children which work well in putting into satisfactory practice that purpose promoted by the act which emphasises that parenting is a continuing and shared responsibility even after a separation
915218 residence orders are as their words indicate practical orders which settle the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom the child is to live here it was important that the boys retained the perception that they lived with their father when they did not live with their mother shared residence has a different psychological impact from residence with one contact with another because as contact is defined it requires that the parent with whom the child lives must allow the child to visit or stay with the other parent here it was necessary for the boys to know that they lived with the respondent and that they did not just visit him
915219 the presence of children is a relevant factor in deciding whether a relationship is marriage like but if the couple are bringing up children together it is unlikely to matter whether or not they are the biological children of both parties both married and unmarried couples both homosexual and heterosexual may bring up children together one or both may have children from another relationship thus it is not at all uncommon in lesbian relationships that a court may grant them a shared residence order so that they may share parental responsibility 143 it follows that a homosexual couple whose relationship is marriage like in the same way that an unmarried homosexual couples relationship is marriage like are indeed in an analogous situation any difference in treatment is based upon their sexual orientation
915220 the cafcass officer had expressed a clear fear that unless a parental responsibility order was made there was a real danger that the appellant would be marginalised in the childrens future i am in no doubt at all that on the judges finding the logical consequence was the conclusion that the children required firm measures to safeguard them from diminution in or loss of a vital side of family life not only their relationship with the appellant but also with her son the parental responsibility order was correctly identified by the cafcass officer as the appropriate safeguard the judges finding required a clear and strong message to the mother that she could not achieve the elimination of the appellant or even the reduction of the appellant from the other parent into some undefined family connection it may be that the mothers own needs and emotions drove her in that direction but that road had to be sealed off for if not sealed off it would be taken at a real cost to the children i do not think that that factor was sufficiently identified by the judge
915221 in this case as in all the cases concerning the upbringing of children the court seeks to identify the course which is in the best interests of the children their welfare is the courts paramount consideration in reaching its decision the court should always have in mind that in the ordinary way the rearing of a child by his or her biological parent can be expected to be in the childs best interests both in the short term and also and importantly in the longer term i decry any tendency to diminish the significance of this factor a child should not be removed from the primary care of his or her biological parents without compelling reason
915222 the statutory position is plain the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration as lord macdermott explained this
915223 i am of the opinion that the fact of parenthood is to be regarded as an important and significant factor in considering which proposals better advance the welfare of the child such fact does not however establish a presumption in favour of the natural parent nor generate a preferential position in favour of the natural parent from which the court commences its decision making process each case should be determined upon the examination of its own merits and of the individuals there involved
915224 to be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that persons family but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the childs welfare
915225 33 there are at least three ways in which a person may be or become a natural parent of a child each of which may be a very significant fact in the childs welfare depending on the circumstances of the particular case
915226 37 parents who are neither genetic nor gestational but who have become the psychological parents of the child have an important contribution to make to their welfare adoptive parents are the most obvious example but there are many others this is the position of cw in this case whatever may have been the mothers stance in the past
915227 sanctioning the move in return for granting a joint residence order and parental responsibility to mr a
915228 5 i do not wish to have to repeat to the mother that for all purposes mr a is to be regarded as hs father relying on expert evidence at an earlier hearing i found this to be in hs best interest in the absence of an appeal the mother

915233 if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope
915234 in this century in this city of all cities we must reject the cold war mindset of the past and resolve to work with russia when we can to stand up for our values when we must and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent

915245 the professional makeup artist community made mac makeup into a global icon because of how fabulous it was this was a major factor in estee lauders decision to buy the company there was a built in credibility and buzz like no other makeup brand had ever achieved professional artists saw the writing on the wall years ago and just quietly started replacing the mac makeup in our kits because the makeup just didnt work the same way any longer the original products had been tampered with and cheapened to increase profits we had no reason to make any noise about it there were still plenty of great professional quality lines to replace it with it wasnt until the consumer population started to notice the sudden lack of mac makeup products in our kits and that alot of us were using other brands thats when the trouble started when asked we were honest and told them that the makeup was no longer up to our professional standards this of course created some negative press and must have affected sales in some way in a swift move to do some damage control and to create the illusion that the pro community was still behind the brand macs training dept under the direction of estee lauder companies began manufacturing their own artists very stepford wives if you ask me and then buying their crediblity by offering their services for free in our place at high profile events and freelance jobs im not sure that they ever really wanted our jobs but we no longer supported the brand at the level we used to a major reason for the aquistion and without us they lost free publicity which means lost sales by replacing us with their mac bots they were assured of a positive buzz and good publicity all the time finding out that selling the services of mac trained salepeople in our place while paying them their regular counter salary was a happy accident and a newly found source of income to the mac estee lauder companies it also gave them a bargaining chip to get all the publicity and product placement they could get their hands on what company would turn down cash free product and free artists to do the workall for placing a mac logo in the credits or on a tear sheet this is a business and how can you fault all these companies for cashing in on a free deal this is how freelance artists lost most of the work they usually booked during fashion week in nyc mac estee lauder companies pretty much sponsors every high profile collection gives money to the designers free products and furnishes muas for free before they infiltrated these venues freelance artists who worked as assistants during fashion week were making up to 600 per show mac is only paying their artists the rate paid to work at the mac counter anywhere from 14 18 an hour offering certifications that will allow them promotions within the company as incentiveoh and the prestige of working fashion week personally id rather have the 600 in my pocketwouldnt you i think these mac muas need to wake up and see how badly theyre being taken advantage of yes we are very upset that the owners of mac the estee lauder companies inc have decided to use their corporate power and deep pockets to strongarm their way into our business it isnt a personal vendetta against professional artists but they have investors to answer to and profit margins to meet they dont care about the casualties they create as long as they increase the sales of mac products at the consumer level if we want our side of this horrible situation to be heard we cant go off screaming and ranting about our personal plight consumers could care less ive already witnessed some pretty aggressive backlash from the lauder ized mac bots working at the counters and cultish consumers who have been brainwashed to the point that they are obsessed with the mac makeup line and the lifestyle it represents very scary we need to educate them about how they are being taken advantage of with slick advertising and artificial buzz fed to them by stepford like mac representatives has anyone notice how every mac counter looks like a goth drag show i guess this is what el though the look should be all of this created to sell the lackluster makeup makeup which they believe we the professional makeup artist community still stand behind with knowledge and truth factual truth not assumptions as our weapon we are far stronger and will be heard by many more people we must also supply the consumer with credible alternative product choices to get them through their rehab from mac addiction rockin angel is working very hard with the help of some pretty famous mighty amazing pro artists to create an information base filled with fantastic products that are being used by the real professionals working in the industry you will be able to see into thier kits and find out what we are using in thier life after mac and the stuff is awesome

915251 i get ga on my kit it used to be just my number
915252 and i get changed in the staff dressing room which is a sure sign youre getting on a bit
915253 but seriously it is only now that i have moved into the coaching side of things i can finally appreciate what all my managers did for me
915254 nowadays i am in early and home late every day is a school day for me and i am learning from iain who has enormous respect in the world of management
915255 he gives me tons of advice and the set up has never been as professional as this since i joined the club
915256 the owners are trying to make the ground fit for the premier league still one or two bits need doing but we are getting there
915257 we are building to get into the premier league some people will say we are not ready to go up id say lets go for it
915258 it is a concern when you see a player clutching his hamstring and i thought here we go again
915259 luckily daniel thinks it is a nerve problem rather than a pulled muscle
915260 we think it is his sciatic nerve connected to his back so its not too much of a problem
915261 its huge because to win these tournaments is tough nowadays
915262 ive played five days in these conditions and had eight or nine matches in the last couple of weeks but ive put in the physical work and its paid off
915263 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
915264 it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year
915265 but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches
915266 in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
915267 gt jessica dudek of canandaigua is among seven riders from monroe and ontario counties taking on a 100 mile ride with mountain climbs around lake tahoe on june 1 to raise money for the leukemia and lymphoma society
915268 youre riding around the lake at 5 000 feet with mountains that are 11 000 or 12 000 feet elevation the mountains still have snow on the tops and the lake is crystal clear
915269 for our team in rochester our goal is to complete it and enjoy it
915270 thats the number one thing to cross the finish line
915271 it was one of the most touching finishes anyone of us had ever seen
915272 im doing it for her she always supported me and she always wanted to teach phys ed im lucky enough to be doing what she wanted to do
915273 theres an amazing amount of supporters with cow bells cheering and egging you on
915274 you cant underestimate the adrenaline rush you get from those people cheering you feel like a little mini tour de france star
915275 thanks to almighty allah the rescue operation has started this morning and an army helicopter has airlifted two dutch climbers
915276 whenever small groups combine thinking it will be easier for them to go to the summit in the end this is what happens
915277 they are strong people but they do not now how to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
915278 were offering young people the opportunity to get off the streets and steer them away from drugs knives and anything else that some of them find themselves tangled up with
915279 the ethos of diverzion is to promote and encourage respectable behaviour among youths and ive held events before with over 2 000 under 18s and never had any trouble
915280 im also looking at the possibility of bringing in some live acts and weve got the backing from both pubwatch and thames valley police
915281 it doesnt matter whether youve done something like this before or not the classes are for boys and girls of all abilities
915282 what were working towards is putting on a show to everyone else from diverzions possibly on one of the under 18 nights
915283 dance gives the kids something to do in their spare time and its also great for them to learn new techniques and moves and then get the chance to perform in front of each other

915285 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
915286 will be investigated and if found to be guilty they will be brought to justice
915287 following meetings held throughout the day by the israel defence forces army and the security establishment the idf is preparing to transfer the rescued fatah operatives to the ramallah area
915288 israel and the idf both of whom operate according to humanitarian values in order to save lives took action both on sunday and again today when a danger to the mens lives became apparent
915289 kenwynes having an operation on monday and well know the exact damage in 24 hours so its fingers crossed
915290 well know one way or another so ill be saying a few prayers
915291 im hopefully a better and wiser manager and im confident the team can do better than last year
915292 ive learned from my mistakes we need to keep improving and weve added one or two staff members as we pushed them a lot last year
915293 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
915294 we are hoping this matter will be thrown out of court
915295 this is the man who is going to push south africa to a prosperous south africa and the people will have the privilege of getting work the poor ones will be supported

915302 he rides him every morning for me since i hurt my hand
915303 when i got him to settle he got into a galloping pace they just left him alone
915304 he accelerated with me after the quarter pole and i knew he had a good shot
915305 we were at a horse retirement function and he said he was going to pick out a yearling for me to train
915306 when i got marlang i knew early on it was the best horse i have ever trained
915307 the turf was really soft after all the rain and that was not to his liking
915308 the fans were clapping us off because they know we had a good showing before the game got spoiled
915309 everybody was pulling everybody away because were all getting frustrated
915310 ive never in my life not shook an officials hand thats the first time in my life ive refused to thank an official
915311 the fourth official was very good it was the other guys on the pitch who for me let us down
915312 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
915313 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
915314 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
915315 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
915316 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
915317 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
915318 hes a top horse it was a little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
915319 well there comes a time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
915320 if thats what happens then im going to give it my best shot and leave the rest up to coach
915321 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
915322 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
915323 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
915324 i came on to the court thinking its not going to be an easy match
915325 i would say i was more experienced in finals and it paid off
915326 i was pretty nervous in my first big final i wished i played better
915327 to be no 1 in the world you have to win a grand slam
915328 i think i still have to get stronger mentally and fitness wise i just want to be healthy and take one step at a time and see if i can make it
915329 now i have enough confidence to believe in myself so we will see
915330 this was my best week ever and i really enjoyed it when you beat your idol jankovic or a player you always looked up to dementieva its something special i hope to have more weeks like this
915331 next final i will be more relaxed and not so scared about it
915332 its getting so you cant mention tiger woods name like lord voldemort in the harry potter books
915333 fellows makes it a hat trick as they say in canadian hockey
915334 as they say in canada it is time to all skate
915335 i just made a couple of mistakes over the plate to a good hitting team and they capitalized
915336 i felt i was getting ahead okay but was struggling a little bit getting my off speed over i just need to repeat this a little bit more
915337 the heats actually kind of nice you never really get cold
915338 that kid mendoza knew that if he could just hang in his team could score some runs
915339 were not scoring runs like that we get a lead weve got to hold it
915340 operates in an important fast growing market which is typically difficult to enter
915341 were trying to bring in a couple of more bodies for practice and well do that once the nfl starts to make cuts
915342 it can be difficult because youve got guys coming in guys getting shuffled to different positions guys running routes differently
915343 so when youre out here at practice you have to get timing down
915344 if youve got two receivers working together they understand each other now youve got two guys who havent really worked together it takes time to figure out how they run routes
915345 ai fini della decisione sulla domanda cautelare presentata dalla parte ricorrente necessario acquisire documentati chiarimenti sul procedimento in oggetto ed ogni atto o documento utile ai fini della decisione sullistanza cautelare
915346 se il tar chiede altre documentazioni prima di decidere sulla sospensiva vuol dire che la partita aperta e tutto ancora da decidere sarebbe opportuno per ora limitarsi ad effettuare la bonifica e nullaltro in attesa della sentenza afferma il primo cittadino ed a maggior ragione suona come un inaccettabile eccesso la decisione unilaterale di ampliare la delimitazione dellarea militare ben oltre la cava del poligono e ben oltre i confini del comune di napoli
915347 a tuttoggi aggiunge il sindaco perrotta nessuno ha mai comunicato al comune di marano alcun esproprio a fini militari nel nostro territorio mi chiedo dunque come possa definirsi questa arbitraria occupazione avvenuta in dispregio ad ogni legge peraltro lo stesso accade nella zona di via pigno dove alcuni cittadini lamentano la letterale invasione della propria traversa privata percorsa ad ogni ora del giorno e della notte da mezzi militari con grave rischio anche per lincolumit dei bambini

915352 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
915353 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
915354 one of the things i think people forget in the midst of some of this is how firmly and strongly the south korean people believe in the american relationship
915355 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
915356 we are probably in for a couple of years of just nothing not good or bad but just nothing
915357 i dont think we are imminently poised for a collapse but i also dont think we are on the verge of a secular bull market in asia for at least another two years
915358 that probably needs to come down given that its almost for sure the u s economy will have another write down
915359 there is a shift in the market the market has moved from being concerned with inflation pressures to realising that perhaps growth is slowing enough across the board to eventually contain inflation pressures so they have started to reprice risks
915360 im actually a big proponent on what can happen when youre bored
915361 ive been able to get the body right in the past month which is nice after a very frustrating start to the year
915362 im starting to contribute a bit more consistently each week which is what ive wanted to do but im still looking to raise the bar every week and become a real premier forward for our team
915363 ive been a bit sore the past couple of weeks but i dont think this time of year youll get too many blokes that are 100 per cent
915364 im good enough to play and play continently over the past month so ive been pretty happy
915365 obviously injury has hampered him kennedy which is a bit disappointing because i was looking to play out the rest of the season with him but that wont happen unfortunately
915366 i havent played much footy with ben mckinley and mark lecras to a certain degree having those guys around me is really good to a chemistry going
915367 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
915368 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
915369 i think when youre captain you want to lead the team and be out there as much as you can because your leadership is so valuable on field especially when weve got so many young defenders
915370 i think if he didnt feel he could contribute and play a role then he probably wouldnt play
915371 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
915372 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
915373 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
915374 its a 30 year old piece of infrastructure in good condition but lots of things need to be done from time to time to keep it in that condition
915375 it is known that keli lane frequented this house prior to the birth of tegan and we believe that she visited there shortly after departing auburn hospital
915376 the gladesville property was the home of one of keli lanes former boyfriends
915377 the archaeologist will sift through the soil remove soil down to a certain depth and locate any remains that may be there
915378 using the cadaver dogs is all part of the process of searching the house again coupled with the techniques that the archaeologist will be using
915379 we will be interviewing the mother and other people associated with this inquiry in the near future
915380 i am sure you all share my deep disappointment that the doha trade negotiations failed to reach agreement last week
915381 while we may not have succeeded this time around achieving significant global trade and investment liberalisation in the future is not only possible it is imperative
915382 to fail to do so would be to fail our children
915383 as wto chief pascal lamy said we need to let the dust settle before deciding the next steps forward
915384 what is clear is that we must continue on the path of trade and investment liberalisation using all of the forums available to us
915385 in this regard we are extremely fortunate to have apec at our disposal to continue with this task in our region
915386 structural economic reform is important in its own right for enhancing efficiencies and competition and driving domestic economic growth and prosperity
915387 however it also enhances our multilateral trade objectives because it helps to break down the behind the border or non tariff barriers that stymie international trade
915388 with the doha round on hold policymakers are searching for new ways forward to make progress on deregulation and reform aimed at securing productivity growth and competitiveness in a more deeply integrated global economy
915389 most of these burdens are a product of domestic regulations and institutions that only national governments can deal with
915390 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
915391 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
915392 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
915393 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
915394 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
915395 provide the u s with the infrastructure and freedom of action to project american power regionally as do u s forces in germany japan and south korea
915396 while the unresolved conflict with iraq provides the immediate justification
915397 the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
915398 absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
915399 the chinese are behind us unmistakably they know it in their quoting some of 25 years behind us

915401 i would love to see farmer play on johnson said
915402 jeffs a leader to all the aboriginal boys at the club and also to a lot of younger guys
915403 i would like to see him stick around for a couple more years because i reckon wiz farmer is a great leader on the field and a lot of boys look up to him
915404 if ive got anything to talk about hes always there to back me up hes sort of like another brother to me
915405 i havent spoken to wiz about his future i think hes spoken to his manager but the way ive seen it i think hell be playing on next year
915406 a party like ours founded by humble men and women in the most difficult clandestine environment during the struggle against the portuguese colonialism could not stop relying on the people for the drafting of its governance programme
915407 theyve kind of said through one of their front office guys that if favre did report they would potentially trade him within the division
915408 i would feel uncomfortable if the computer cant connect to the internet
915409 they have no brothers no sisters they want to have friends
915410 the parents strongly expect their child to be somebody in the future
915411 i saw how popular they were so i decided to make one thats better
915412 i want everyone to know that wushu is not as mysterious as people think and that its not hard to learn
915413 i want people to be interested in wushu and i want them to realize that wushu can be part of their daily life
915414 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic
915415 while you might think gamers purchase fewer movie discs that others we didnt see any significant evidence of that in our results
915416 in discussions with both governments i will cover matters of mutual interest including the response to the breakdown in the world trade organisation doha round of negotiations global financial uncertainty regional architecture and climate change mr rudd said
915417 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world he said
915418 those are both driven very much by fear of google
915419 we see acquisitions as a fundamental way of driving growth
915420 camilla lindberg gjorde sig k nd genom att tidigare i r g emot den borgerliga allianslinjen i riksdagens fra omr stning
915421 the acquisition has a perfect fit with our operations in europe
915422 we now get a foothold in russia and we will use that platform to introduce many of our pipeline products
915423 it is a good combination which raises the long term potential in eastern europe and they can achieve synergies in western europe both on the cost and revenue side that means they can raise the margins quite fast
915424 you decide who can see and use your information on a case by case basis
915425 we do not use your health information for commercial purposes unless we ask and you clearly tell us we may
915426 the love earth pilot project is important because it shows for the first time that materials found in a piece of jewelry purchased from a retailer of size can be made traceable all the way from the mine to the store
915427 secondly it is important because it ensures that at each step of the supply chain from the mine to the manufacturer companies are working toward leading industry standards for environmental and social performance
915428 its gotten way way worse especially in the last year or two
915429 every single thing we buy has little neon blue flashing lights on it turn the light off and they shine like beacons
915430 whoever sees that glow through my window must think im keeping aliens in my spare room
915431 we will have to find a solution for the longer term
915432 the police and soldiers just arrest them without any rules
915433 the beijing olympics is facing a terrorist threat unsurpassed in olympic history
915434 if 16 people died i would think that this is the highest casualty ever reported for an incident
915435 financial planning is important because many of us have a limited income and it allows us to decide between what we want to allocate what we want to consume and what we want to save
915436 most people when they think of retirement think i have my whole life ahead of me and if you are at the age of 25 you cannot even contemplate that decision
915437 but as einstein said one of the greatest discoveries was compound interest rate that is if you put aside money when you are young and you take higher risks those investments will compound over time
915438 so generally you become more risk averse when you are older as you do not want to lose your financial capital
915439 hence it is important that you start early for the power of compounding to start working in your favour
915440 by far inflation is the greatest enemy of any saver because inflation destroys the value of the money and unless you get a return that compensates you for the inflation people do not have an incentive for saving
915441 so when you invest you must take on a longer term perspective and when there is inflation the value of financial assets like equity comes down because inflation has a huge input on the valuation of assets
915442 we feel this is going to be one of the biggest books of the year for us

915511 provides businesses with the servers service levels and resources they require to power their organisation without them needing to buy or manage a hardware platform
915512 usc is about making more efficient use of space in the data centre
915513 about 18 months ago we looked at more efficient ways of doing hosting at that time there was huge shortage of data centre space and it was getting more expensive we wanted to reduce costs and reduce space but retain the service levels
915514 virtualisation was a means to an end to maximise utilisation of the servers we were running
915515 with usc we go through a consulting process with the client about what they need
915516 we look at the amount of cpus ram capacity etc that the client requires and then produce a service offering to satisfy that
915517 for me the killer application of a virtualised hosting service is the scalability because we normally built a lot of spare capacity into client platforms for example take a retail customer which gets very busy at christmas time their platform must be able to cope with peak demand and then scale back down when demand is over it is up to us to manage additional capacity needed to support those clients
915518 traditionally customers build a system to handle a certain finite demand
915519 with usc we are showing businesses that they can meet commercial objectives without bottlenecks or technology failing them

915569 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
915570 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
915571 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
915572 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
915573 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
915574 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
915575 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
915576 in the interim i will be undertaking her portfolio roles
915577 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government
915578 i will respect their right to make a decision on further comments regarding her condition
915579 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint

915617 i think we needed to look at our business and also admit that certain things had to be fixed it was a good period where we could stocktake and attend to things that needed be fixed
915618 i hope the public give him some time to warm into that role of international footballer because hes a class act and a very good player hes not a winger hes a centre another player i have an enormous respect for at the three quarter is jose gear hes an international player in the waiting

915620 the potential for private enterprise like the maori health providers that developed in the in the 1990s under national is significant there is a lot of non govrnment agencies in the private sector and maori are some of those who have garnered a lot of experience over the last two decades in delivering services to he community we will certainly want to engage with them in some of the key policy areas
915621 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire

915626 he showed more than just his ability he showed his heart thats the sign of a great race horse
915627 the plan was to go to the lead but that would have been suicidal
915628 that guy on the outside was making the lead no matter what
915629 if big brown was a human being id want to go clubbing with him

915645 teles major stories pivot around the formation and evolution of the federalist society the emergence and institutionalization of law and economics as part of law school curriculums the center for individual rights and the institute for justice nested within these narratives are vignettes of other players and organizations that illustrate how patrons and entrepreneurs learned from their mistakes and redirected their strategies teles quickly alerts his readers that he not concerned with organizations like the american center for law and justice that have been involved in religious or social conservative litigation nor is he interested in the thicket of conservative think tanks that sprouted up during the past three decades or in the proliferation of litigating groups with traditional pro business agendas or interests in tort reform the price of teles tight focus however is easily off set by the many benefits generated by his in depth discussions

915652 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
915653 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
915654 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
915655 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
915656 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
915657 the antenna stands about 8 feet high and straddles the width of the runway
915658 we have witness accounts that it did touch down and the pilot was trying to land and during the landing roll out for some reason they made a decision to try to take off and get airborne again
915659 the airplane was still on the ground when it hit that antenna and the accident sequence began at that point and the plane ended up in that cornfield
915660 we are looking at all aspects of the flight not just focusing on any one thing

915667 oh that mom dragged you to the bedroom and when
915668 i cant tell you how excited i am to own this airplane and to work with the crew at x air
915669 from my initial interest in the ls all the way through the sales and delivery process x air has been absolutely fabulous to work with
915670 its a long haul but i am looking forward to seeing the beautiful country below us and enjoying my new plane
915671 2008 has been an amazing year for x air weve assembled a superior team of professionals went through the astm consensus standard paces and are successfully building selling and delivering aircraft
915672 to do all that in a mere matter of months is a tribute to the dedicated team that makes up the x air organization
915673 our demo schedule is filling up and public response is extremely positive
915674 the demo flights have been well received and people particularly enjoy the docile feel of the aircraft and the short field performance all for a base price of 46 900
915675 with a tourism oriented economy we simply could not continue to forfeit this lucrative segment to our caribbean neighbors
915676 the president has demonstrated his determination to move the dominican republic to the top position in general aviation tourism
915677 this segment of tourism cannot be developed under the shadow of user fees
915678 it is in our national interest to move to a fee free policy
915679 we are placing resources and mechanisms in position to ensure the ongoing enforcement and integrity of the presidents decree
915680 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
915681 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
915682 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
915683 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
915684 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
915685 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
915686 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together
915687 this is under investigation and i will send out a note as soon as we understand exactly what happened
915688 the most important message id like to send right now is that spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
915689 we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that i have also given the go ahead to begin fabrication of flight six
915690 as a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit spacex recently accepted a significant investment
915691 combined with our existing cash reserves that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching falcon 1 and develop falcon 9 and dragon manned space vehicle
915692 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
915693 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
915694 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
915695 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
915696 easily be the largest gathering of women pilots in history
915697 it is important to recognize the accomplishments of women in ways that challenge and motivate others women can reach for the sky and elevate their lives
915698 this is an especially attractive feature for many of our customers who have not had access to broadcast datalink weather services like those found in the continental us
915699 until now theyve had no alternatives or have had to rely on limited access to much higher cost corporate aviation solutions that are available internationally the mlx770 can now be utilized to assist pilots in making go no go decisions on the ground and to fly more strategically while en route
915700 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
915701 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
915702 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
915703 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
915704 have your say leave a comment below about this article
915705 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
915706 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
915707 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
915708 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
915709 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
915710 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
915711 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
915712 who are open to doing something on the production side
915713 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
915714 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
915715 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
915716 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
915717 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
915718 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
915719 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
915720 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
915721 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
915722 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
915723 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
915724 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
915725 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
915726 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
915727 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
915728 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
915729 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
915730 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
915731 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
915732 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
915733 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
915734 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
915735 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
915736 first system is approx 0 77 day does not include deductible

915739 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
915740 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
915741 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
915742 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
915743 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
915744 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
915745 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
915746 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
915747 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
915748 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
915749 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
915750 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
915751 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
915752 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
915753 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
915754 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
915755 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
915756 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
915757 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
915758 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
915759 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
915760 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
915761 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
915762 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
915763 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
915764 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
915765 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
915766 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
915767 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
915768 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
915769 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
915770 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
915771 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
915772 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
915773 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
915774 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
915775 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
915776 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
915777 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
915778 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
915779 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
915780 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
915781 a lot of what were going to do is going to relate to how the 2008 election goes
915782 well look and see what kinds of problems there are and that will inform what we do
915783 dannii has already proved she can cut it on tv with her stints on x factor and
915784 dannii has the body the hair the teeth and the figure to make it in america i would not be surprised to see her on a big show by next year
915785 i got a lot of stick from the uk press saying i was fat
915786 i look back on pictures and i was certainly bigger than i am now but i felt good about myself so i found it a bit weird that other people had a problem with it
915787 stop being egotistical they dont care about you no one reads your freakin blog face the facts

915791 doesnt believe in assigning specific point values and letter grades to most assignments
915792 normally friday night is where i win this rally but now we have lost time so i will have to go at maximum attack tomorrow
915793 the second stage is really tricky and hard to note
915794 we were going along and then we were missing a line in the notes so that got pretty crazy its going good
915795 i will continue just like today and get more time in the car
915796 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
915797 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
915798 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
915799 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
915800 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
915801 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
915802 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
915803 were still in it and in second place so im thankful
915804 we pushed really hard on the two long stages and made up a lot of time there is no way we can catch pat so we will be third
915805 we lost some time to legault on one stage when we had a flat but i think weve made it up on the second pass of the long stage where we were a minute faster
915806 it was the hardest hit in a car while not crashing
915807 our heads just ping ponged between the wings on the seat
915808 its been a mixed rally for us the stages were really rough and they took their toll
915809 it was great to get max points towards the championship
915810 the plan is just to win a fourth time in a row at defi ste agathe
915811 this is exactly what we needed im really really happy its been a tonne of fun
915812 ken you think im short petter solberg is only this tall and his co driver phil mills comes to about here
915813 the scoreline was harsh but we played some good football it was a great contest for 60 minutes until one silly thing from one of my players it was a big turning point
915814 our effort and endeavour was really good for the first hour but i was really disappointed with the last eight minutes of the match
915815 top six is our goal until someone says there is no way we can make the play offs we will always believe it is still possible
915816 we are looking up we have pulled away from the bottom two and now my concern is to catch the teams in front of us
915817 he kicked well and scored a nice try but there are plenty of areas where he can improve
915818 it was easy to play in this game when you are 30 0 ahead at half time
915819 there are things he needs to do to maintain his level of intelligence over the course of the whole 80 minutes
915820 it was a very poor performance in the first 40 minutes i will have to watch the dvd because the first half was embarrassing
915821 when a team just brushes through it is simple one to one defence and thats very difficult to take
915822 i need to look at things and there could be some major surgery before the next game
915823 there are a few names being bandied about for man of steel but hes got to be in for it
915824 simon grix was also outstanding but it was a great effort from all the boys and it had to be
915825 i thought in the first half there was quite a bit of parity between us but in the second half we showed a lot of fatigue
915826 i think most teams suffer the week after playing st helens but were going to have to regroup and try our reignite our season before the play offs
915827 will looks erratic and he often looks like he is running through a brick wall
915828 hes a bit like the wild man of borneo as he looks as though hes just tearing around but theres a lot of skill there and he keeps getting better
915829 weve been nipped and pipped too often thats why today meant so much
915830 we were as far away from where we want to be as possible
915831 we gave ourselves a lot to do in the first half and then after we got ourselves in a position to win the game let ourselves down again
915832 im very disappointed with how we finished the game as we should have been stronger than that
915833 have both come out in favor of obamas timetable for withdrawal
915834 youre either a beaver lover or youre not a beaver lover

915839 is the first book in ms hobbs new series the soldier son trilogy
915840 more and more begins to come to light although i have to admit it is less than is needed to fully understand even the smallest piece of the bigger picture
915841 gemmells first novel and the first published in the drenai series
915842 so if you happen to run across a copy of it in a used book store you probably have a nice collectible on your hands smile and be happy but if not you can pick up a copy anywhere online or at your local bookstore or library legend
915843 hmmm this could be good but i am not sure i want to spend the money right now and find out that it isnt
915844 predicting an uplift in sales as more people try to save a few pounds on their shopping by switching to scratch cooking
915845 when i look back on my college days maybe it was a different era in the late 60s but most of my fraternity brothers didnt have criminal records not yet most of them even those who were in rotc and hunters but the behaviors they exhibited werent the kind of behaviors that gave me confidence that packing guns in their lockers or in their rooms would make me safer
915846 allowing handguns does provide extra protection and extra deterrent against crime
915847 its not a one stop solution but provides a deterrent and i feel very comfortable with people who have fulfilled their requirement to be able to carry
915848 the media likes to paint us as paranoid about mass shootings on campus
915849 what we are more concerned about are the types of crimes that happen on a daily basis on our campuses across the country these crimes are rape assault robberies these are things we should be able to protect ourselves against
915850 rather than creating safe zones for victims we may unintentionally be creating safe zones for criminals who are doing the attacks and who have less to worry about
915851 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
915852 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
915853 if anyone brought a gun to class id be scared out of my mind regardless if they are trying to stop someone who is shooting someone or not
915854 the radar is a phenomenal asset for all the nato countries to have
915855 we have a void in this part of europe that can now be covered with this device the radar has the ability to track anything moving over european air space
915856 the czech republic has stepped forward ahead of everyone else to engage the threat
915857 the agreement will put us in a stronger position to defend freedom with high technology it will also prevent our european allies from being intimated or threatened by non democratic societies
915858 poland has been more mercenary in their negotiations and its clear the government in warsaw wants more from the u s
915859 but they understand the threat and i think this can be resolved
915860 i think russia has forgotten that the czech republic is a nato member and when they threaten the czech republic they threaten the 26 nations representing nato
915861 most of the time the russians are not very credible with their threat they are more bravado
915862 i remain of the view we have to be a little careful here
915863 i dont think russias reaction is appropriate and in fact i think its partly contrived and somewhat exaggerated to put it kindly
915864 but theyre still painting themselves into a certain position and frankly this missile defense program while i think in the end a good idea is not desperately and acutely needed tomorrow we should not be squandering whats left of our good relations with russia
915865 i believe our political will is very strong on this point
915866 theres a threat from iran thats real and we are not going to start asking russia for permission to protect our own citizens and our allies and we are certainly not going to allow iran to hold european cities hostage
915867 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
915868 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
915869 it has not had the kind of projected cost that many had thought it would when it was first enacted so actually that has been generally some very positive news and provided a good benefit for seniors who needed to have prescription drugs as part of a modern health benefit under medicare
915870 this is true across the board when it comes to now about two thirds of the budget
915871 this is probably one of the more disappointing parts of what congress is basically not doing it bodes very poorly for our ability as a country to deal with some of these entitlements
915872 the medicare drug benefit is providing real help to seniors and the disabled and its going to be part of our healthcare landscape for years to come
915873 the key question for us is how we can fix the program so that more of the benefit goes to seniors and the disabled and less winds up in the pockets of the drug companies and insurers
915874 the reason that we are holding hearings on part d is entirely to do with partisan politics and nothing to do with what the real problems are
915875 its a huge problem and congressman davis is getting serious about it now because theres a chance to do something about it
915876 every one of the options is horrible but if not now when you know
915877 without meaningful changes to social security medicare and medicaid these three programs are likely to exert unsustainable pressure on federal spending over the next several decades and leave policymakers with bad choices higher taxes benefit cuts or increased debt
915878 but instead of solutions john mccain is offering gimmicks americans deserve better
915879 our members know that gas prices are not going to be going down in the long run in the long run the trajectory is up so we need real solutions that will allow americans cheap and clean energy to power our future
915880 that also means we need to call out gimmicks like offshore drilling that do nothing to move us toward that clean energy future
915881 just this week big oil companies bp exxonmobil chevron are reporting yet another quarter of billions in record breaking profits actually outstripping even last years record profits
915882 conocophillips netted 5 4 billion bp pulled in 9 5 billion and today exxonmobil and shell announced profits of 11 68 billion and 11 6 respectively to put that into perspective that is about 800 in profit over the course of a year for every driver in america
915883 sen obama will take on the oil companies and end the choke hold they have on our economy and on our politics
915884 sen mccains plan is just more of the same hes proposing measures that will continue these obscene profits by the oil companies that we see today and do very little to help average americans
915885 a day after barack obama told voters to inflate their tires and reject domestic exploration his special interest friends are echoing his anti drilling message on tv
915886 attacking john mccains solutions to americas energy crisis and offering nothing but tire maintenance advice will not reduce prices at the pump
915887 special interest groups that oppose america maximizing its own natural resources hope obama wins but voters who want lower gas prices will support mccain
915888 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing s but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
915889 profit is a sign that a company is doing something right
915890 its using its resources effectively and its shareholders are getting value out of their investment
915891 there has been a continual drum beat from house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid and there has been vote after vote to put a windfall profits tax on these companies or to take away the tax cuts that were given a few years ago to corporations
915892 it would make as much sense to punish people who havent invested in the oil companies
915893 the people who have invested in the oil companies are making it possible for us to get gasoline when we go to the service station people may say prices are too high but if more people had invested in oil companies then there would be more investment in new fields and new refineries and new pipelines and prices would be lower
915894 soldiers family says he died in combat armys first report of accident denied
915895 he died in action they were attacked they were targeted
915896 once the investigation is complete the army will be able to release a statement that encompasses everything that occurred in relation to sgt textors death
915897 the incident is under investigation and that typically means non combat
915898 as of yesterday the circumstances surrounding stevensons death were still unclear and military officials said it could be a year before they release autopsy results the family said
915899 mr verbeke was left a quadriplegic after being injured when he was hit by a piece of equipment while trying to repair a cable on the flight deck he suffered traumatic brain injury a collapsed lung fractured vertebrae and fractured ribs
915900 a u s soldier died in a non combat related incident while conducting operations in nineveh province july 31 according to military statement late thursday
915901 at norml we have always taken the position that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the responsible use of marijuana by adults and this proposal incorporates that principle into federal law
915902 once we recognize that the criminal justice approach is not helpful or useful for drug abusers we will develop good programs to help these people who need help but to leave alone those millions of citizens who live law abiding lives but who enjoy smoking a joint when they relax in the evening just as millions of other americans enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail in the evening
915903 h r 5843 would simply remove the threat of arrest and the host of consequences that can come with an arrest at the federal level including the possible loss of student financial aid housing assistance food stamps voting rights and in some cases prison for simple possession or nonprofit transfer of small amounts of marijuana
915904 what the bill would do is limit big governments role in marijuana policy and put that responsibility more in the hands of the states
915905 the fda has concluded that no sound scientific studies support the medical use of marijuana for treatment in the united states and that no data exist to support the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use
915906 there are alternative fda approved medications in existence for treatment of many of the proposed uses of smoked marijuana
915907 the levels of thc in marijuana have reached the highest recorded amounts ever since scientific analysis of the drug began in the late 1970s
915908 the increased potency of marijuana is a contributing factor to the substantial increase in the number of american teenagers in treatment for marijuana dependence
915909 this increase in potency has also been linked to increased risks for mental health disorders including psychosis and schizophrenia
915910 even congressman frank has stated publicly that the chances of this legislation passing are not high

915916 and i am already going through withdrawal i only hope that mr erikson stays well ahead of the u s publishing with his writing despite the long wait for his debut american readers have definitely been spoiled with the rapid fire release of his novels a new novel every 8 to 10 months
915917 i could have started with this book and not noticed the difference although i do believe that having a good introduction to the malazan empire and its major players is important hence the release of the prior 4 novels
915918 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity
915919 there are no bad memories only good ones thats what amusement parks do they make you smile

915921 we were always looking for girls the girls were always looking for guys we didnt have cars to be cruising
915922 i remember sitting in that little booth all by myself in the heat
915923 i want to carry the memory of it on here
915924 theres a lot more emphasis on being prepared especially for the parents
915925 from my perspective the city is getting more and more focused on public education
915926 if we keep focused and put resources where we need to put resources we can make a difference
915927 im glad i got to get school supplies because usually when you go to stores the stuffs all out this is all in one place and you dont have to go to three or four stores
915928 wow how ugly what a mess this is going to be near impossible to fix
915929 i understand that pakistani president musharraf has his own challenges but let me make this clear there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3 000 americans they are plotting to strike again if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
915930 apparently obamas policy is to have tea with our enemies while bombing our allies
915931 i find it amusing that those who voted to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me
915932 one thing im very confident about is my judgment in foreign policy is i believe better than any other candidate in this race republican or democrat
915933 well i also think im the most qualified to run the decathlon because i watch sports on television all the time
915934 i think that senator obama showed a degree of naivete when he advocated direct talks with the leader of north korea and the president to iran and of all these other people who are sponsoring terror all over the world
915935 i think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons in any circumstance
915936 let me scratch that theres been no discussion of nuclear weapons thats not on the table

916072 v llig unverst ndlich ist dass der m chtigste gewerkschaftschef samt ehefrau ausgerechnet zu einem zeitpunkt seinen gesponserten s dseeurlaub antritt zu dem sein fu volk am boden in einem spektakul ren arbeitskampf gegen die lufthansa steht offenbar hat bsirske im st ndigen umgang mit den wirtschaftsf hrern dieser republik schon jede bodenhaftung und jedes gef hl daf r verloren was er den beitragszahlenden verdi mitgliedern schuldig ist doch wirft bsirskes freiflug dar ber hinaus die grunds tzliche frage auf ob die lufthansa nicht gut beraten w re verg nstigungen f r aufsichtsratsmitglieder generell zu streichen

916146 the debate with respect to the right to keep and bear arms as with other guarantees in the bill of rights was not over whether it was desirable all agreed that it was but over whether it needed to be codified in the constitution during the 1788 ratification debates the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in antifederalist rhetoric
916147 h istory showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the ablebodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the peoples arms enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents

916159 the beauty of it is that we hold the cards for our own destiny as a footy club this year and thats how you want it to be
916160 you dont want to be relying on other teams to do things for you youve got to do it yourself
916161 thats probably the best weve done for awhile in terms of having everybody contributing
916162 porps goes down and someone else steps up so its all about picking up the rope and everybody just contributing their bit to our overall performance
916163 at this stage hell play the season out unless he believes he cant contribute
916164 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
916165 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
916166 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
916167 hes probably been under pressure moreso this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
916168 i think when youre captain you want to lead the team and be out there as much as you can because your leadership is so valuable on field especially when weve got so many young defenders get the best of foxtel

916171 if ive got anything to talk about hes always there to back me up hes sort of like another brother to me
916172 i havent spoken to wiz about his future i think hes spoken to his manager but the way ive seen it i think hell be playing on next year

916295 with less than six months left in his term the president
916296 with less than six months left in his term the president is on a course to commit the united states to guarantee iraqs security far into the future
916297 this legislation makes clear that the president cannot do that without congressional approval rather than engaging in these negotiations which by the administrations admission will set the broad parameters of the u s iraq relationship the president should secure a short term agreement through the un or with iraq to provide the necessary legal protection for u s forces after the current un mandate expires at the end of the year
916298 a strategic framework for a continued u s iraqi relationship that includes future u s security commitments and arrangements will be sustainable only with strong and broad political support in both the united states and iraq only direct involvement by and partnership with the congress will ensure a consensus of support in the united states
916299 unfortunately the administration continues to handle long term security negotiations in the same manner that has characterized its entire approach to iraq since 2003 without congressional input
916300 now we have no choice but to require congress to approve any u s iraq strategic agreement that includes provisions committing the united states to the defense of iraq against aggression
916301 it is imperative that congress exercise its proper authority on the vital issue of our future relationship with iraq and on the question of whether the united states should maintain a long term presence in that country
916302 this bipartisan legislation would ensure that any agreement with iraq would not be implemented without the explicit consent of congress and protects the constitutional responsibilities of the senate in this important national security matter
916303 s upporting the republic of iraq in defending its democratic system against internal and external threats

916356 no decisions have yet been made on how our changes to the foi laws which will prevent conclusive certificates being issued in the future should deal with conclusive certificates issued in the past that issue needs to be considered as part of our changes to the legal framework

916366 this acquisition is an excellent complement to further accelerate the strong growth biopolymer has realized supplying specialty stabilizers to chinese dairy companies as well as improve service and supply chain efficiencies to the chinese food ingredient market
916367 these statistics as well as the fact that all of the key carmakers including the asian oems are either already represented in russia or will be establishing their presence there shortly prompted us to make this investment
916368 by imaging an isolated object at high resolution in three dimensions weve opened the door to a range of applications in material science nanotechnology and cellular biology
916369 this blob and beam structure explains why these low density materials are weaker than predicted and explains the high mass scaling exponent seen in the materials
916370 ironically our celebrity section people say they dont want to read about celebrities and yet the topic continually gets the top page views
916371 way better than an impersonal letter apologizing for mishandling a computer that was sent in for repair no do you know what most people want they want you to care
916372 my mom didnt even put a bathing suit on us at the country club until we were 9
916373 it will be a one stop shop for everything you need for the beach
916374 this book cuts to the chase getting noticed is everything not getting noticed is oblivion its must reading
916375 we live in a celebrity driven world and tsufit tells you how to take advantage of that fact
916376 it takes a star to teach a star and it takes a star to want to learn stardom
916377 ive only blurbed three or four movies in my time but ive lent my name to perhaps a hundred books
916378 and really maybe thats not so bad young writers and filmmakers need a hand up because its a hard world out there that alone doesnt justify a blurb but in in most cases good work does it isnt just about the artist either a blurb is sometimes a better way to point people toward the good stuff than a 2500 word review its certainly more direct
916379 american peptide company is poised to benefit greatly from this acquisition
916380 by operating as an enterprise of otsuka chemical company we will create new global networking opportunities as well as channel more financial resources to our production and manufacturing facilities as a result we will enhance our total peptide management services to our customers

916383 were elated at the prospect of having the necessary resources to use our collective experience and drive forward our original goal of developing tools and spending time to demonstrate how simple and transparent communicating can work for motivating party members voters and supporters we can now hope to make progress by the next election and tool up local campaigns and affiliated labour groups our future on the labour blogosphere is to push forward the principles of new media campaigning whether that be to the party leaders or by empowering the grassroots
916384 the domains were bought by me privately for personal usage only and the new statesman is not involved
916385 he is ahead of where he was last year i hope theo is more regular in the team this year number 14 is a big number to inherit but i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances
916386 i feel his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration and final ball is better
916387 there is goal scoring potential in him and hopefully one day we will get that out of him
916388 for now he is not a link player between the midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man because there you get bombarded in the air he can play wide right and wide left as well
916389 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16
916390 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not phased by the big games the quality is there
916391 i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good

916408 there are no absolute answers in science but we can know x based on controlled experimental observation we can therefore predict y and we can test whether that is scientifically valid
916409 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
916410 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
916411 mr gove is elaborating and extending that most elemental of tory creeds the belief that we should take responsibility for our actions

916415 he once again played very well on sunday he is showing he can settle to english football
916416 his adaptation has been natural the fact there are a lot of frenchmen helped me as well
916417 he is an open minded boy as a consequence there is no problem
916418 we are going in to a season now and we have to have everybody focused on our targets
916419 if we can bring in one more player we will do it if not we will go with the squad we have i am happy with that
916420 we have to now continue to be focused on our targets

916439 chinese american views on the 29th olympiad in beijing often depend on where their families came from did they immigrate from the mainland or from hong kong or taiwan or were their families part of the centuries old diaspora that scattered chinese across asia in places such as vietnam indonesia thailand and the malay peninsula their attitudes also depend on whether their families came to america as traditional immigrants or political refugees some do business in china while others have linked up with u s human rights groups to protest political and religious persecution there attitudes toward the olympics also reflect the arc of chinese american politics since 1989 when the world was riveted and then horrified by the events in tiananmen square as china in the past two decades has gone from international pariah to economic superstar the countrys critics have had to soften their tactics
916440 as i argue in the current new york review of books the most critical element in the formation of chinas modern identity has been the legacy of the countrys
916441 we all have to live with one another awhile longer wouldnt it be good for everybody if the world came out of the olympics knowing and liking china a little more than before
916442 but chinese people also increasingly live where they want to live

916478 i think about that every day and i say im glad im not a first round pick because that would be a whole bunch of pressure
916479 not that its not a lot of pressure them just drafting me no matter what round because they believe that you can play i just have to work hard to show them that i was worth that pick
916480 mario is not improving the way wed like him to so well just continue to push him
916481 im sure hes probably trying to fire me up because thats his job
916482 im just coming out here to work every day theyre the coaches they know a lot better than i do i still do have a lot to work on
916483 its just that when you come here you dont have any scholarships you cant sit around for four years you better get it now i still can get cut drafted or not so thats the one thing that ive got to keep on my mind
916484 am i naive enough to think nothings going to happen
916485 no it probably will its the competitive nature of these guys and they dont want to be shown up and theyre mad when they are
916486 well try to handle it the best that we can but weve got to be prepared for it if it happens well shut it down if in the first practice theres too much of it going on well shut it down and practice against ourselves
916487 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
916488 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
916489 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
916490 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
916491 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy
916492 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
916493 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
916494 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
916495 i dont know of any involvement with santos other than he was sharing the cab
916496 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
916497 we are an equal opportunity employer and a drug free workplace we conduct drug testing both before and during employment
916498 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky
916499 welshy played another gr8 game and is earning a strong reputation for one of thebest taggers out there the way he stops other players but still picks up 25 possesions is legendary
916500 jobe watson was the best welsh a very close second
916501 hille was good as always fletcher not bad welsh and watson both by far best players on ground inseparable watson 40 odd disposals and welsh game of his life welsh is in the form of his life
916502 subject to some criticism because of poor disposal by foot earlier in the year jobe has obviously been working on this aspect of his game because you couldnt fault any of his 17 kicks on saturday along with his 24 handpasses he played possibly the best game of his career clear best on ground so far as im concerned
916503 i think they all played really well good team work its always good to win against collingwood and carlton d well done bombers looks great for 09 xd
916504 i think another improved player who hasnt been mentioned is leroy jetta he is starting to become a good player last few weeks he is averaging about 14 touches 3 assists and 2 goals a game that is pretty good for a small forward i will be putting ten bucks on him for first goal of the match against the dees keep up the good work leroy
916505 angus set the tone early in the game leading heath shaw to the ball and running him all over the park shaw was exhausted by half time and could provide no rebound from defence for the pies as a result
916506 it is great to see the bombers young players standing up the future looks bright even though peverill and mal michael are playing well at the moment i think we need to keep our youth policy sorry but this needs to be there last year
916507 reimers jetta monfries hille watson welsh all young guns amp being led by the biggest gun of all matthew knights he is the most positive never whinges to the press amp obviously knows how to encourage our young boys to beleive in themselves do you all know how lucky we are to have him as coach and by the way paul barnard is the greatest runner
916508 companies that outsmart their competitors depend on culture to manage behavior incumbents use rules and controls in conversations with people at companies featured in the book i noticed that everyone seems to know just what to do at key moments a customer emergency a transgression by an employee or some other breakdown shared values and beliefs drive and control behavior sometimes these bedrock values are made explicit sometimes they are undeclared and simply appear in time of need in either case they lead people to the right solution in incumbent businesses especially big ones rules and controls often dominate and they sometimes seem to insult the intelligence and integrity of the organizations employees the prevailing assumption is that when given the chance people will do the wrong thing exactly the opposite view of companies in this book

916522 theres a difference between making something for fun and making a big production out of something when it doesnt need to be its not a bad idea to start on a hobby podcast before you get started on something other people are dependent on
916523 find out the parts of you that are interested but dont give away your secrets or emotions but make it personal and be aware especially when it come to doing a podcast for an organization have that element of disclosure where you decide if youre an insider or outsider

916527 were listening say whatever you want to say and well listen to you
916528 ive got two hours these are my pre set skills who in the area can work with me right now
916529 this is our community this is our group within this community we offer these skills
916530 basically they have this fake bruce lee walking around for 70 minutes just so that they could use the 12 minutes of footage of the real bruce lee fighting
916531 it doesnt matter if youre a ten year old now or were in the 70s he will always live on
916532 why stop at a top rate of 455 pounds why not go further
916533 there is perhaps a danger that the proposed changes are large enough to be noticed but not large enough to change behaviour
916534 if climate change really is as important and urgent as the government frequently and rightly acknowledges then it would suggest there is a strong and defensible case for much more penal taxes on high emissions cars
916535 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
916536 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
916537 i didnt have control and when i got it in the zone they hit it hard
916538 i didnt do my job today but ill go out there again in five days and do my job
916539 i just want to get out of the way and do what i do
916540 when he first came to he had all these tubes in him
916541 he wasnt able to breathe on his own or talk
916542 i showed the therapist how to get around with a white cane
916543 i miraculously recovered and god was with me all the way
916544 were going to have to look at all kinds of measures to keep the costs low
916545 if you have an emergency and need to go to the scene go ahead and drive your car
916546 how often does that happen not enough to justify having a car 365 days a year
916547 even though its not a police car people do slow down when they see us
916548 when we start the budget were in trouble on day one as far as fuel
916549 it wasnt a cut or a slice i mean they were stabbed
916550 we dont think that he had any active participation in the stabbing
916551 i dont get it when did becoming a white hacker become bad you
916552 do you what can what you want what you must feel the hunger inside dont lose your trust
916553 there is great concern because of damage to leaves at an important point in the growing season
916554 they are like little armored tanks people in illinois have been battling them its kind of a foreshadowing of our future
916555 they are very colorful and about the size of a june bug
916556 that one was on the raspberries then i found a few in other areas
916557 all you can do is spray every week until they go away
916558 there are so many of them theres about 300 plants they will chew on but they love grape leaves they are very high on their priority list
916559 youre trying to protect a crop worth thousands of dollars
916560 oboes you cant perform an emotional solo with an oboe you cant do it it just looks weird
916561 you need to stop working night shifts and then talking to me mother
916562 the word of the day legs women of the world must go and spread the word
916563 if at first you dont succeed sky diving isnt for you
916564 you know the poor people will find a way to have vodka tonight thats the way it works
916565 i would think that fairly soon once the reality of this sinks in we will see some fairly significant increases
916566 weve really seen it explode over the past four or five years now the rest of the state is finally catching on
916567 in the whole scheme of things our lives are relatively unimportant
916568 i thought there was a chance i wouldnt be coming back and i suggested we see other people
916569 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
916570 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
916571 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
916572 i watched the prices go up when i went to the supermarket id say wow this is 3
916573 you put a little seed in and it comes to maturity like a child
916574 i have a 30 person waiting list for a new garden
916575 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
916576 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
916577 we ordered three times as many fruit trees as ever before
916578 we sold out of all the vegetables in june seeds too
916579 were sick of rising fuel and food prices so were turning this weed patch into a vegetable garden want to help
916580 were doing eight quarts of spaghetti sauce from the yard right now weve got so many tomatoes
916581 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the
916582 sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on mars
916583 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
916584 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
916585 i intentionally chose a decentralized model where each student would have his or her own blog because i wanted them to have a sense of owning their work my main goal for using blogs is to get students actively involved in their own education
916586 those adamant clinton supporters the older and i would say wealthier women and some of the better known feminists from the dark ages i think they will use his vice presidential choice whether a woman or a man as an excuse not to support him

916624 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
916625 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
916626 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
916627 and theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
916628 what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader a person who has come to washington with a different agenda of someone who really does want to be a vehicle for change
916629 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail

916635 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
916636 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
916637 when it comes to sanctions experience shows that it is ineffective especially when it comes to the nuclear issue
916638 of course in the event of a possible war we will aim to prolong its duration so as to be able to take advantage of all our missile and non missile capabilities
916639 self try real hard to remember how much that hurt how you had to weirdly move your whole torso to look to the left how worrisome it was to face the fact that youre turning into that downstairs woman in pet sematary

916671 obvious common sense that porn is perfectly vile and grounded in nothing but a world of pure horror
916672 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
916673 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us
916674 maybe there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
916675 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
916676 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
916677 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
916678 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
916679 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
916680 i kid you not they asked me about the off shore hedge fund thing and i said straight faced i did it to learn about poverty i swayah to god
916681 its gratifying to see more women in prominent roles in tech
916682 computer sciences and the internet have made technology tangible and put a face on them as careers for everyone women included
916683 anecdotally i do think that there are more opportunities generally in technology for people who may not look or match up to traditional definitions of say what an engineer or someone in product management should look like
916684 this is a direct result of the fact that creating things online today is basically free and requires very little direct coding experience to create real businesses or new products
916685 there are ever increasing opportunities for women because there are ever increasing opportunities
916686 the more a company is pitched to women the more opportunity there seems to be for women to lead these companies
916687 i want to go where the consumers are going and where i can create incredible experiences for them
916688 you can now bypass vcs altogether and let the adoption of your product or service speak for itself
916689 what do you mean by more compared to a few years ago when there werent many at all
916690 there is a bit of intimidation yes after all these years
916691 you walk into a room full of men once everyone talks the gender gap disappears if you know what youre talking about the environment is more welcoming but traces of sexism exist
916692 women remain underrepresented in engineering math and science and they still confront the same face to face discrimination
916693 really the numbers for executive female officers in all industries could be better the same can be said for government and education it is a long struggle
916694 i used to pretend i was a secretary at engineering meetings i would take notes and suggest doing this and that on an engineering project
916695 they would agree i didnt want these guys to know i was their boss
916696 he wanted me to swing for the fences like a man
916697 they need the biggest possible incentive thats why the government should be even bolder really penal rates for high emission cars and really attractive carrots so that tax is almost nothing on the greenest models
916698 on a year over year basis we saw significant improvements across a number of key operating metrics ranging from gross margins to non gaap earnings per share and cash flow from operations
916699 je propose un pacte entre les aliens et la cor e du nord
916700 a step by step improvement of existing drugs is generally not seen as real innovation but rather as a clever marketing trick
916701 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
916702 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people whose lived through this but were not broken
916703 across canada thousands of people mourn the loss of tim mclean jr his life has touched the hearts of friends family and those who didnt have the chance to meet him
916704 at that point i think that theyd be quite amazed to know the amount of support and i think it would be a real comfort to them im hoping it will be
916705 he made sense peace and friendship out of an possible explosive situation
916706 this was a horrible disgusting incomprehensible random act of violence
916707 please join me in doing a random act of kindness to help heal the pain that is going on out there
916708 i think we should bring all these prices to over 3
916709 all of my prices though fair are more expensive than standardized prices
916710 it seemed like every week there was a situation outside a licensed premise
916711 its a shame it happened it wasnt a good decision it was an injustice we did to that young man
916712 tsns footage was inconclusive but with the help of the stamps we had a perfect view from their sideline footage of what happened
916713 we talked to coaches and the officials and we wanted to be swift with justice as teams asked us to be at the beginning of the season
916714 if there is an opportunity i will do it in person
916715 if not then over the phone hopefully hes man enough to accept our apology we lick our wounds and move on
916716 ireland has no other option at that point there are no recourses for him he cant go to replay
916717 that individual wont be named as its hard enough to attract young officials to the game without persecuting them publicly but well let our clubs know how it will be handled internally
916718 i could say a lot of things but i guess thats what happens when youre the grey cup champions everybody loves you
916719 it takes a lot of balls to take a guy out of the game like that ive never seen anything like it
916720 the ref got smoked pretty hard so he thought armour just took him off on purpose
916721 all indications show the festival made a profit this year
916722 after many years of struggling it is great to make a profit
916723 as far as public security there were no major problems
916724 the event has improved by leaps and bounds over the years
916725 we are from guyana and want to keep our culture alive
916726 the toronto bands are good but have to practise more
916727 we have a different style and way of doing things in montreal
916728 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all while courting the taliban it sleeps with america
916729 we need to identify these people and weed them out
916730 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
916731 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all while courting the taliban it sleeps with america
916732 the vision for ending the israel palestinian conflict is based on two states but the split between gaza and the west bank and the ongoing israeli settlement expansion policy undermine and jeopardize that vision
916733 we want to eradicate chaos and anarchy criminals and outlaws
916734 hamas is conducting legal searches in the hilles compound which has become the centre of chaos and terror
916735 i think the parties do not have enough motives to reconcile
916736 yesterday in my car i looked to see if anybody in the street was spitting on the ground i didnt see anybody
916737 we understand that reporters are often rushed and sometimes they will lose their temper so we must be patient it is important to always be professional because we are representing our country and you are our guests
916738 like you read the bible and we dont you believe in god and we dont
916739 most chinese people are used to squat toilets i believe the olympic games will be an opportunity to speed up the transition of cultural habits to meet international requirements
916740 thats why were here its raining please close the window
916741 it affected us by about 3 000 worth of business which is quite substantial for a small business such as ours
916742 we can confirm it did not make it to its final destination
916743 hes been flying with us for a few years in that area
916744 our hearts go out to the families involved and thats our priority now
916745 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
916746 transfer wealth from the oil patch to the rest of the country
916747 appealing is easy and most people win so it is worth your while to challenge a medicare denial
916748 usually these things peak around the time taxes are due
916749 basically its another timely current event thats on top of peoples lists and another lure to deceive people into giving away credentials in some way
916750 you filed your tax return and youre expecting a refund
916751 if you get a communication from the irs it is via a letter in the mail or a phone call
916752 are trying to leverage the trust of a government agency and trying to increase the odds of success
916753 blindly phishing a very small pond the odds for success are low but phish an entire u s taxpaying population and the probability of success goes way up youre phishing a much bigger pond
916754 the human skeletons as well as the associated artifacts such as pottery ornaments and food remains like shells and animal bones are currently being analyzed in order to extract more information about the burials and lifestyles of the ancient people who lived in the niah subis region during that time
916755 beaked whale species appear to cease vocalizing and foraging for food in the area around active sonar transmissions
916756 since these animals feed at depth this could have the effect of preventing a beaked whale from feeding over the course of the trial and could lead to second or third order effects on the animal and population as a whole
916757 active sonar releases energy into the ocean and there is evidence to suggest that this may have an effect on marine mammals
916758 in 2007 the ice was 1 3 metres thick on average compared with 2 6 metres in 2004
916759 he steve noticed the slightest traces of mortar adhering to pieces of flint in a field near st peters pit and michael and i followed up this sighting with a radar survey of the field
916760 the results were spectacular not only did they locate the building but the radar showed that it survived in very good condition and was quite large not a simple cell or room but something that resembled a small church
916761 it was probably built in the early 12th century and underwent a number of changes in ground plan
916762 one particularly exciting find is a large section of the south wall of the church which collapsed inwards probably when the building was being dismantled for building materials in the 16th century
916763 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
916764 many people buy these packages to k2 and especially to everest
916765 they are certainly strong people but they do not have enough experience to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
916766 there are so many people all together that they have a feeling of safety but at the first problem the whole thing goes wrong and thats whats happening now on k2
916767 a mountain is a mountain not a coast on a sea or a hotel room and if a mountain is putting down ice or the weather is changing these people are totally unprepared
916768 si les 16 morts sont confirm s il sagira du plus lourd bilan jamais enregistr dans une attaque
916769 on a beau utiliser les webcams et autres technologies de linternet on est toujours la recherche de cette alchimie et si elle nest pas l on passe simplement la personne suivante
916770 si les gens d cident quils naiment pas quelquun cela prend habituellement 30 secondes
916771 si vous rencontrez quelquun que vous aimez trois minutes sont suffisantes si vous ne laimez pas 30 secondes cest trop long
916772 si vous voyez quelquun qui vous pla t dans la vraie vie vous ne labordez pas avec votre cv pour le comparer au sien vous parlez simplement
916773 when bud has to dig down as deep as he can and he comes up with words like giants its not even lost on elitists or someone well versed in the world of politics it was inside his language inside his vocabulary
916774 if you want to articulate what we really need we need a giant or someone to behave as one
916775 i travel around the world talking to other nations parliamentarians about voting and democracy
916776 its embarrassing to tour the world and talk with these people who look to our system and for us to have such low participation its very cliche to say every vote counts but there are a lot of examples where it does
916777 92 million people in last years election made a difference they didnt vote
916778 i remember going to the doctors office and having a long conversation with the doctor about how bad the system is
916779 but every city in america used to be the most beautiful city in america
916780 were very proud to offer our audiences their first chance to see these productions
916781 we feel like we have a little different demographic in fort collins than you expect from dinner theaters our audiences not only want to see the new stuff they demand it
916782 we always wanted to make our own path and do shows we thought people wanted to see
916783 cats which drew 10 500 was a sign from above for us to take that path
916784 how are you going to do a show like that justice
916785 but its also a blessing people are always telling me they like seeing it so up close the intimacy they get in return allows them to take something different away from the show during cats people would say time after time i saw this on broadway but i understood it better here
916786 they were able to make a more personal connection with these characters than they could sitting in row z of the buell theatre
916787 in many ways its a traditional big show that pokes fun at all things show business
916788 and i dont think anyone will stand up and say they were offended by the way hitler is portrayed
916789 the more risque the show the fewer gripes we get for example we only got one or two complaints out of the 7 000 who saw the male stripper comedy the full monty but we got 10 for beauty and the beast because people thought the dresses were too low cut
916790 it just seemed like a perfect way to stay current with the state of television today
916791 at the end of the day this is what they do for a living
916792 they were excited by this they got it what a fresh idea this was and how this could be fun for them
916793 treat each of the five people equally and hopefully find places in the show that each can shine
916794 we figure that freedom of the press is only important if its offensive
916795 if were not gonna offend anybody we dont need protection of the first amendment
916796 never before has any piece of artwork or sculpture or a memoriam been erected in honor of a critic
916797 the song is absolutely lighthearted and fun and flirty but the album takes you on an emotional journey from the light to the dark from the light to the heavy
916798 we didnt want people to make any projections on what they think the album is going to be no we wanted to shock and surprise people with something completely different
916799 a very interesting and excellent voice himself youll get to hear a lot more of him on this record
916800 it felt like it was a sign not only of our growth but more acceptance within the industry
916801 it will be a long time before i really can emotionally grasp what it means to have won that award and what it means to be the only woman
916802 i didnt get married in the spotlight and i did not intend on getting divorced in the spotlight
916803 it was private and sacred to me and when you hold something sacred you keep it to yourself
916804 what do you mean local connection i dont understand this question we live here
916805 yeah what he said i live on the south side
916806 ever since we made the top 10 in the denver post just kidding it has always been real we were real before anyone had ever heard of us and when everyone forgets about us we will still be a real band
916807 only adam is real the rest of us are figments of our imagination
916808 joe is in a dog paloma which begat joe sampson and wentworth kersey adam littles paia xandy plays in the roger green band and in porlolo xandy also does studio sessions for all sorts of denver bands
916809 im just a substitute cause i know how to play both loud and soft
916810 ill continue to have marital problems and problems with my teenage daughter
916811 because once were there and filming we dont pay attention to whats going on
916812 were just down there in our little texas heaven and not worried about the future
916813 thank you thats all i can say i could have never done this without you guys
916814 we sent notification to all the delegates that were here
916815 but were also contacting all the progressives were letting protesters know who we are and what were doing with food they not only want to travel here with their message they want to eat well
916816 weve always had these songs in our heads theyre not as big as sigur ros songs but theyre bigger than jack and meg white songs and now we have them recorded on a record
916817 i could tell they all had to do something more just to make it work but now with another player in there they can let loose more
916818 all the sudden i can move around a lot more
916819 having tim playing with us allows me a lot more freedom to look up at the crowd and people feed off that energy they feed off us having a good time
916820 four piece rock is simple and thats what we were missing
916821 yet still we had more and more people coming to our shows
916822 instead of our college friends coming out to see us there were complete strangers in the audiences i started noticing that at the beginning of this year and it was exciting
916823 one can imagine that if you discover someone in your garden who is taking your photo then youre not necessarily going to politely show them the way out
916824 its good to be back in colorado well be back next week in denver members of civet watch stage side as a fort collins policeman surveys the mosh pit kristen browning blas too
916825 murphy murphy darling dear i long for you now night and day
916826 but theres a mosh pit and things going on we gotta go around
916827 heres a little song we wrote for the colorado rockies can you say 2 3 4
916828 ive come here to put my arms around you and say one final goodbye yeah ill see you on the other side
916829 these days we have an unstated idea of what we sound like
916830 but even after only three or four shows we knew we were were having a lot of fun
916831 i dont think were super aware of some sense of musical integrity
916832 were just trying to write more songs that sound like us
916833 and not just because of the instrumentation but because we dont use any effects
916834 coming in at the level we did we were able to get shows much more easily than we did in asheville
916835 although i wonder if it was easier because we moved out here from across the country it almost seemed like we were a touring band
916836 we wanted an event to give back to the city
916837 grasp helps kids from 14 to 17 years old get out of gangs they try to get them going the right way and get them away from gangs and violence
916838 grasp tries to make them think about it when theyre painting as a creative outlet
916839 we notice at a lot of runway shows they always want to be the coolest
916840 were stylists but we want to make events that foster creativity and long term change get some depth into it with art and a good cause
916841 it does speak to things ive been trying to do here anyway
916842 which are melding in very tasteful ways multimedia into the concerts and also just trying to make the case for new music that new music can be very relevant culturally that it can sound beautiful and that it can tell a story in an easily discernible way the first time through
916843 it celebrates the oral traditions that are still alive and are still strong and that still sustain and i think this oratorio does that in a contemporary way
916844 the way it works with indigenous storytelling and connects with a western musical art form it created something very beautiful something very powerful and something that spoke to a large audience
916845 i thought ok but first of all i have to go look up and see what a libretto is and what an oratorio is
916846 so i did and it seemed very interesting to me and i started talking to mark
916847 what it does is take the basic theme of love restoration and healing thats really what this oratorio is about and i felt that was really what the enemy way ceremony is essentially about
916848 i was born and raised on the reservation and im very aware of what can and cannot be taken from ceremonial context i respect that
916849 we didnt want this piece to feel like a disney movie
916850 we didnt want to take a traditional story and turn it into pocahontas which is exactly what the film industry does to these stories
916851 theres a reason why the indigenous cultures in this world are very apprehensive of the western world and thats exactly why because things are taken out of context they are pulled out in such a way that they lose their symbolic meaning to that culture
916852 one of my grandfathers who was one of the first ones to object to what was going on sent me this wonderful message that he felt that it was well done and it was beautifully portrayed it was just really all praise
916853 we have friends in france and we goof off down there on the weekends
916854 i got to know him a little bit just on the set a bit i was so impressed by his performance and when i saw the movie i was bowled over on set we would be chatting about this or that then the director would say were ready heath and then hed go straight into that maniacal thing
916855 i told him im too old to play a part like that
916856 oh i just drink wine with food now though i thoroughly enjoy it
916857 you know i was never an alcoholic but it is true i was on occasion very very drunk
916858 but you know i used to go out on the town with peter otoole so i had a bloody master craftsman teaching me
916859 what screwed up the 70s was drugs because you had to stay at home and take the bloody drugs and you couldnt go out or you got busted by the police the 60s got finished around 1975 when everybody was high as a kite and couldnt go out
916860 ive returned to that farm in a way i live in a great big barn with a great big garden when you get old you relive your childhood which is what im doing
916861 after the war we lived in a prefabricated house because we were bombed out you put the house up in a day if i were to show you this house which was the size of this room it was like paradise for me if i were to show it to you youd think it the biggest piece of junk but it was luxury for us hot and cold running water it had a bathroom electricity for me it was incredible
916862 i took her to beverly hills like in february when in england its rain and snow and bloody bleak
916863 i was working in a factory and i told this old guy i was going to be an actor but i didnt know how to go about it
916864 caine got a job as assistant stage manager out in the boonies he had never seen a professional play
916865 i didnt have the money to go to the theater
916866 it was only a 10 minute role it was only 10 days work in nassau in the bahamas and they were going to pay me a million bucks for 10 days and i said hey ill do that i didnt take any notice of it
916867 i didnt write it direct it photograph it produce it didnt play any of the leading parts but i get the blame
916868 so i was very pleased with myself but i dont do that anymore
916869 i think thats not going to be a difficult task
916870 he was very tired looking and his hair was messed up when he got there
916871 of course when he started to play later every hair was perfect
916872 he had sent christmas cards out to people before he died
916873 its a remarkable old building thats just been worn and worn from all those people and all that action
916874 it has a personality and i think we all like to see new things cookin there
916875 thats the reason it was the only bar in town
916876 we had to remodel take the ceiling out cut a hole in the roof and put in a restaurant
916877 i had to build a stage and get a grand piano and have it tuned
916878 i remember count basie walking in the front doors and standing there by himself looking around the room he just kind of shook his head but he was really nice and the show was spectacular when youre sitting in front of a row of six saxophones so close like that it sends chills up your spine
916879 my wife and i used to sit at the bar and would turn around on our bar stools and the leaders of these bands were within 4 feet of our faces
916880 it was like you were in the band i dont know if any of those bands played in that small of a venue before or after
916881 the wizard of oz through aug 10 at center stage
916882 eigentlich sind die klassischen marketingbudgets der unternehmen nur mehr bl dsinn bei richtigem einsatz erreichen google adwords die zielgruppen g nstiger und vor allem skalierbar bei erfolgreichen adwords kampagnen sind budget limits erfolgssch digend
916883 google ist nat rlich der bigplayer und wird derzeit von keiner anderen suchmaschine auch nur ann hernd erreicht
916884 einfach gesagt wollen wir mit weniger werbebudget mehr umsatz erreichen in 98 der f llen gelingt uns das auch eigentlich kein wunder sind doch normale werbeagenturen noch nicht mit dem neuen medium und seinen m glichkeiten vertraut
916885 iso 20000 ist eine unabh ngige beurteilung unserer managementf higkeit sowie der prozessqualit t in unserem unternehmen einige kunden setzen diese zertifizierung bereits voraus indem wir zeigen dass wir it services in einer definierten qualit t bereitstellen und managen richten wir uns st rker auf die bed rfnisse unserer kunden aus
916886 mit iso 20000 beweisen wir dar ber hinaus die wettbewerbsf higkeit unserer it organisation am markt und k nnen uns mit anderen unternehmen in diesem bereich messen und vergleichen
916887 how many people can say theyre in a band with people they were friends with long before the band
916888 singer nathan mcgarvey is our sons godfather and keyboardist justin croft is our daughters godfather we practice twice a week but we see each other a lot more than just that
916889 i told him i play the flugelhorn and it sounds like chocolate
916890 were not a religious band so much as religion is how we know each other and how we define our values
916891 were not a band that has a religious mission weve been offered christian festivals but we dont want to play them now
916892 one of the biggest reasons behind us giving the music away was that wed just changed our name
916893 and the sponsor worked for us because illegal petes is a punk rock venue
916894 i was in a coffee shop downtown talking with a kid who was studying jazz
916895 i told him i played in hearts of palm and he didnt know who we were but then when i told him about the cd he said that hed learned about us in his music business classes at ucd
916896 i dont think you could ask for a better deal than the one the flobots were offered
916897 the price of being sober is being scared out of your mind
916898 our intention is to keep the same beautiful divey joint i would feel wrong going in there swinging hammers
916899 finally a spectacular failure of the ladies room plumbing made us do this
916900 you never know whats going to happen thats why theyre so much fun to cover
916901 a career is wonderful thing but you cant snuggle up to it on a cold night
916902 if you are considering a proprietary reverse mortgage you must proceed with caution
916903 because of my background in concerts im very acutely aware of how to deal with high maintenance clientele in terms of security and production
916904 theyre all such different places in size and theme that they can cover all the bases whether its casual dining or something they want to feel more formal
916905 i think it reeks of desperation if they have to position themselves as so edgy and so controversial that theyve been called out by us
916906 what were trying to do is communicate with the audience in a way that they like and can appreciate
916907 this sort of campaign resonates with someone who likes gossip girl
916908 well written headlines that are provocative and would catch our viewers attention
916909 and in a tongue in cheek way capture what the show is about
916910 weve always done one show per production as a benefit for a nonprofit but weve always looked outside the theater community which seems kind of silly because theaters are nonprofits too
916911 i think its great especially coming out of the national performing arts convention last month
916912 the message was clear lets make our communities stronger and to do that we have to work together this is a small step in the right direction
916913 people who attend paragon love the theater but thats five nights of theater a year that leaves plenty of weekends open for them to see other theater
916914 plus they get all the money thats not poaching its just a company we like and really respect
916915 and if thats what we can do in the quiet phase
916916 the effect of gamma rays on man in the moon marigolds
916917 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
916918 its what we grew up with except no slipcovers because the drapers are not jewish
916919 ive gone out of my way not to do the tv thing where everybody becomes friends
916920 season 2 is not joan christina hendricks and peggy as roommates
916921 the death of american style was casual friday and elastic
916922 the internet is the perfect back drop for improving our online gaming economy product sales
916923 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
916924 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
916925 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
916926 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
916927 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the online gaming economy sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
916928 after starting an internet online gaming economy sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
916929 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
916930 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our online gaming economy sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
916931 with internet online gaming economy sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
916932 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our online gaming economy company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire

916941 people are not learning from history whenever small groups combine thinking it will be easier for them to go to the summit in the end this is what happens
916942 we dont have any evidence before us that qantass safety systems are not working or that there are links between these events or that there are any safety problems within qantas
916943 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
916944 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
916945 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
916946 we are working very hard to return the game to the program in 2016 even in london if we can
916947 we feel confident that we can present to the ioc and the program commission reasons for baseballs inclusion
916948 our sport has not chosen to shut down to make this possible i think there are people trying to come up with an answer for that
916949 if some of these smart guys can come up with a way to get these major league guys without stopping the season we can have a chance to go forward
916950 the best thing we can do is put on a great show at the olympics with great enthusiasm and go about it in a way that makes people want that in 2012 and 2016 and going forward
916951 they are probably going to be the team to beat
916952 cuba is blessed with a lot of great young talent
916953 japan has come a long way korea taiwan and now china they have the fever with the great athletes they have it wont be long until they have great players
916954 there was a lot of pressure for us to bring back the us to where we belong on top
916955 we didnt play very good as the dream team you cant run those games like an all star game
916956 you cant afford to make a mistake in selecting the team the level of competition is too good around the world
916957 we will guarantee them to use them correctly to not overpitch them
916958 we have noticed the number of small and medium size businesses as well as entrepreneurial ventures that approach souq to showcase their items rising steadily and this is effectively what has motivated us to launch souq com stores
916959 first it moa critically diminishes the territorial integrity of the philippines second that power is not within the purview of the executive department
916960 secrecy as we all know is a governing policy of the gma president gloria initials administration
916961 the non disclosure of the provisions of the moa has deprived the people of its right to information and to participate in the decision making process
916962 this is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights of the people
916963 how will we now respond to the claim of the igorots for example that a major portion of the mountain province is their ancestral domain and should therefore be turned into the igorot juridical entity
916964 the missing link in philippine sports is the training the government is challenged to put up a school to provide these requirements
916965 it was noted by the committee and validated by the bir bureau of internal revenue and boc bureau of customs that collection performance suffers a dive during election years this decline is evident six months prior to elections
916966 if frequent elections are held the collection of revenues and consequently the balancing the budget objective are greatly affected
916967 he was surprised when we arrested him but he did not show any resistance
916968 we have also learned that he was also the prime suspect of an attempted rape involving a 15 year old in barangay tagbina san vicente town surigao del sur
916969 but i am now a changed man i now preach the words of god
916970 the court issued a tro temporary restraining order restraining the respondents from signing the moa
916971 this being so the entire process the negotiations involving the said moa and the drafts documents thereof resulting from said negotiations is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege which prevents the disclosure of information that could subvert military or diplomatic objectives
916972 we submit to the sound discretion of the supreme court its the ultimate arbiter of issues
916973 this requires more the explanation from the government we will let the government defend its side
916974 i cannot say how big or how deep it is but this is a setback
916975 but we are committed to a peaceful resolution not withstanding the tro
916976 this is a relief as a whole this will allow dispassionate objective discussion on the merits of issues surrounding the agreement
916977 the secretary general of the oic intimated to me this endorsement for the postponement of the elections during the foreign ministers meeting of the oic in kampala uganda on june 18 20 he said it would create the space for the peace process
916978 it will show the commitment of the grp government of the republic of the philippines to the peace process and it is part of actively engaging the oic
916979 just a temporary setback if the elections are not postponed we have to live with that

916990 my decision to come to the colorado symphony six years ago turned out to be the right decision in every way
916991 the decision to leave was a much tougher one to make the toughest decision of my life
916992 real life x files conspiracy the possible movie spoiler cover up
916993 months after the shooting had wrapped carter remained as circumspect about the story as he was during its development
916994 i dont think weve written down or toward any end except to tell a great story
916995 this has nothing to do with the x files mythology it stands on its own you can pick it up like a brand new thing
916996 one of the things i realize coming back to the film is that theres a whole new way of looking at their story
916997 maybe it was glossed over in the fun or lost in the scary stuff but fox and dana are on a quest while it was certainly a quest to shed light on a government conspiracy about aliens it was also a quest for meaning you might even say for god
916998 this is what sustained them what bonded them his wanting to believe in the paranormal and her wanting to believe science explained everything
916999 on the big screen there are lots of things to consider for and to that end
917000 but because it was david and gillian it didnt feel all that different to be working with them again the energy was terrific

917005 this is the first opportunity we have in many years to elect a mayor and councillors in a free and unintimidating atmosphere
917006 thanks to almighty allah the rescue operation has started this morning and an army helicopter has airlifted two dutch climbers
917007 whenever small groups combine thinking it will be easier for them to go to the summit in the end this is what happens
917008 they are strong people but they do not now how to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
917009 today mr jalili will talk over the phone with mr solana
917010 when it comes to our inalienable rights we will press ahead
917011 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
917012 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
917013 when it comes to sanctions experience shows that it is ineffective especially when it comes to the nuclear issue
917014 of course in the event of a possible war we will aim to prolong its duration so as to be able to take advantage of all our missile and non missile capabilities
917015 the future of the company is at stake in this project

917022 were trying to find new business models to keep shows alive
917023 that may be what i have in common with the character
917024 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched

917030 the mend men are blackmailers who went into militancy to collect money from government
917031 they were trying to create economic and political empire for themselves
917032 the people arrested by the mend are pdp youths in ese odo local government area and they were arrested at night because they refused to join their militant group
917033 one of the unfortunate events was the alleged rape of a lady in ilesa one miss tosin ajakaiye by certain persons who were reportedly avenging the burning of the property of one alhaji gani oladiran a pdp chieftain by action congress supporters following the announcement of the governorship election of 15th april 2007

917035 i wish to inform you that this ministry after following due process has forwarded a legal advice to the police to prosecute the accused persons against whom a prima facie case had been made
917036 theres no need to clear any air is it a crime for one to be on holiday so if you work continuously at the highest echelon of the political party for nine years and you decide to have a break from the day to day running what is wrong with that
917037 you see people should stop being mischievous bode george is back ive rested enough my systems are working very well all the checks i didnt do for many years that nearly resulted to ill health ive done them now and i feel well too
917038 in fact i feel like an 18 year old ready to launch back on the plough there is no problem at all i am happy to be back
917039 they were curious that he was travelling out immediately after leaving office
917040 there was nothing specific against him but i think the fact that he was going abroad so soon simply attracted their attention
917041 though ngwaland like igboland has been a victim of neglect in the hands of past governments with total neglect on both infrastructural and human capital development issues ranging from bad roads to other social amenities which are the sole responsibility of the state that is not enough to turn the people to militants because of their peace loving nature
917042 one of the robbers was shot in the waist and is receiving treatment at a city hospital
917043 recently cases of carjacking and housebreaking have become a cause for concern and had become a challenge to the police force we were recording between three to four robberies every night
917044 however we have managed to bust the syndicate and investigations are intensifying so that we bring those responsible to book we will also not hesitate to use minimum force to apprehend these notorious criminals that have been terrorising residents
917045 these criminals live within the communities and we appeal to the public to give us tips the public can do so anonymously through our suggestion boxes and hotlines at harare central police station 777777 or the police general headquarters 700171
917046 it has become absolutely necessarily to inform you of the arbitrary admission into junior secondary schools in koma district jada local government area by both the government and private secondary schools here
917047 none of the admitted children have successfully completed primary education the fact is that some of them left school in primary two to proceed to junior secondary one
917048 at our last stake holders meeting you had cautioned that admission to jssi will be based on the performance of pupils at the continuous assessment level ca
917049 we pray that you intervene and compel the schools to send our children back
917050 attached are the least of the names of pupils and the schools that admitted them while we await your response we stand for sound educational foundation believing in our children for a better nigeria

917054 now with its easy support for global publishing and quarkxpress 8 being the first ever simultaneous global release of quarkxpress a global tour was an obvious choice

917071 ill admit the first two years i was a major part of the problem i was not very clear on what i wanted the virtual assistant to do
917072 its also to me become a major red flag when a virtual assistant volunteers
917073 because of all the reasons above i can no longer find virtual assistants to be a viable option at 45 hour many virtual assistants are far too over priced and i have paid virtual assistants amounts like 30 35 and 40 hour you do not get what you pay for

917080 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
917081 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
917082 one of the things i think people forget in the midst of some of this is how firmly and strongly the south
917083 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
917084 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
917085 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
917086 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
917087 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
917088 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
917089 and spoke of reports that north koreans suffer torture forced abortions and in some cases execution
917090 human rights record is abysmal and every day that the people of north korea continue to suffer represents an unacceptable continuation of oppression
917091 the north koreans dont like to hear the term human rights but that does not mean that we shouldnt raise it

917102 its one of those mountains where once youve climbed it you dont ever go back
917103 for every step you go up it tries to bring you down
917104 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
917105 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
917106 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
917107 i know you want to stumpy but we have a lot of bills and you know the money is tight and 10 is 10
917108 martha im 70 now and i dont know if ill ever get the chance again so i just have to have a ride in that there airplane
917109 excuse me folks i couldnt help but hear your situation and i have a deal for you ill take both of you up together and if you can both make the entire trip without saying a word or even making the slightest sound ill give the ride for free but if either of you make a sound its 10 each

917111 well i was gonna say something when martha fell out but 10 is 10
917112 while discussing how depressing the visiting bullpen in houston is hernandez said
917113 the guys we have in this room are the guys were going to be playing with from here on out we feel good about that we have to continue to compete get quality at bats pitch quality games i think everyone in here likes where were heading
917114 where we are at the present means that were good
917115 to go where we need to go and where we want to go we have to pitch like we did the last three games
917116 we won our last three road games at seattle thats what we have to dwell on not what we did before that on the road we have to take the same mind set that we have at home to the road if we do that well continue to win games
917117 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward and just attacking whats at hand
917118 we did that very well daisuke came out and threw his fastball stayed in his delivery and the ball came out of his hand real well he looked like he was pitching with confidence we played with energy it was a good day
917119 the momentum will carry over tomorrow if clay buchholz takes it and goes deep
917120 thats always the case in this game the momentum goes as far as our starting pitcher allows
917121 in limited at bats hes gotten some big hits some timely hits but hes played the game and blended in like our young guys do mixed in with some veterans hes helping us win games
917122 were going on this trip in a good frame of mind
917123 weve created a better feeling for ourselves we know what we have to do and we feel we have the players that we can do it with
917124 i think everyone is on the same page i think its going to be a fun couple of months ahead
917125 but we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts
917126 although partly driven by lower than expected impairments the operating profit of the bank held up reasonably well

917131 hey look if you dont like the job after 4 weeks we will pay you to leave

917134 we dont beat the reaper by living longer we beat the reaper by living well and living fully
917135 ich bin sehr stolz dass ich sterreich in peking vertreten darf und freue mich schon auf die bevorstehenden aufgaben
917136 give me a computer and quiet place to work and im happy
917137 i totally agree i want to get stuff done not play foosball and i definitely dont want to live at work i tried it during the blackout and it was a drag
917138 is to promote sporting culture in the force while also providing a strong platform for comradeship and stimulating physical fitness needed to keep policemen alert
917139 i dont think we have any real good chance in the flat sprints and quarter mile but if you ask me of the chances of blessing okagbare i will tell you that that girl is capable of surprises in the long jump if she is able to overcome stage fright in her first olympics dont rule out another medal for nigeria in that event
917140 before the atlanta games chioma ajunwa was not jumping 6 80m her best was 6 70m but she went ahead to jump 7 12m to win the gold from a strong field of very experienced jumpers i am also praying that blessing gets her acts right anything can happen the fact that she is jumping 6 86m now means that she is capable of a 6 90m or even a 7 00m once she gets into the 7m mark anything can happen
917141 i dont think we should expect much from the sprint and the quarter mile if anything is going to come at all it should be in the relays even then our runners must get their baton exchange right and be expecting that something funny happens to the jamaicans and the americans i cannot imagine the jamaicans who are all running under 10 secs to throw away the opportunity to win the gold
917142 in as much as we appreciate the federal governments concern for provision of sports facilities for the host university
917143 the change in date will affect the nuga calendar and with the progress of work recorded so far by unn and the commitment of the host university the december date is still achievable
917144 the money approved by the federal government would help a great deal to ensure speedy completion of work going on in the university
917145 federal government assistance as come in good time to ensure provision of first class facilities for the school
917146 i have had a taxing schedule over the past four months and need sometime to rest
917147 so i told the promoter that i will not be able to fight and recommended kachigwada as my replacement
917148 i hope that he does well and endear himself more with the namibian promoters and possibly get direct invitations in future
917149 we met the congolese promoter in zambia the other time and he invited sibanda
917150 i also talked to him on the possibility of making links between zimbabwe and drc boxers and thats why sibanda is there right now
917151 the board is taking an active role in getting the fights seeing that some of the managers are not doing anything for their boxers
917152 it should not be duty of the board to organise fights for boxers because that is what managers are there for and we should be doing the administration
917153 example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other
917154 thats what we are hoping to do monos are a very good team and you could say they are the team of the moment
917155 it will be a difficult game for us but we are ready for them they have a very good run we definitely respect them but we wont give that much when we are on the field
917156 we also believe that we are a very difficult team to beat and we hope our form can carry the day for us
917157 he is our playmaker but there is nothing we can do we just have to carry on
917158 everyone focussed on the job at hand because we have not had any hassles
917159 we are happy with the way we have been treated by zamalek so far
917160 we held our first session at their training ground a few hours after we had arrived and it was a good workout after the long flight from harare via johannesburg
917161 i am also happy that everyone knows that we are not here on holiday we are here for business and we would be happy with a victory or at least a draw
917162 it is always difficult away from home and we have to work very hard for the points
917163 we are also aware that their fans will try to intimidate us but we have played before huge crowds before and we have set ourselves a target to reach the final or at least the semi final if we cant win the cup and that is why there is good team spirit in our camp
917164 it is up to us now to fight for a good result on sunday
917165 i think everyone in the group looks at us as surprise packages as underdogs because they are all former champions and for us getting into the mini league after a nine year absence was a big bonus
917166 it must be remembered that no one gave us a chance against etoile du sahel others doubted us against asec and so we remain the underdogs which is good for us because the pressure is always on our opponents
917167 i think the fact that they lost in their first game to al ahly could work in our favour because they want to put up a better show and get some points on the board so for us it is just a question of maintaining our form get a good result and ensure we set a good platform for our return to play al ahly in two weeks time
917168 we have had some constant changes to our team because of injuries and suspensions and still managed to win which shows that we have a strong squad
917169 i believe we can match any team because we are prepared to work for each other and we are ready to die on the pitch
917170 everyone from the administration the coaches the players and the nation has been doing their bit for us
917171 a few of our supporters here in cairo have told us that they will be at the stadium but just knowing that back home we will have the whole nation behind us is enough motivation for us
917172 i was also watching egyptian tv when we arrived and i noticed that they gave long profiles of all the other seven teams in the champions league mini league but they did not have anything on dynamos so hopefully we will do so well against both zamalek and al ahly so that by the time they do their next profiles they will know something about dynamos
917173 i believe that siasia has a good side ive seen them play a couple of times and i know that they have quality players but if the players dont believe in themselves then not even the best coach in the world can turn them into world beaters
917174 they players have to first believe that they are good enough to be able to beat anyone which also means that they cant be intimidate by any opposition once this is attained then other factors may then come into play like referees decision luck and so on
917175 their european experience is a big advantage at least they should not be intimidated by the players they will be competing against or affected by the occasion
917176 what i mean by this is that should they not do well in one game they should not allow it affect them for the next in the group stage they are guaranteed three games so they should take each in its stride for the second round this will not be feasible since it becomes a knock out competition but they should realise that a good performance in the group stage will help them in the next but then they have to qualify first to reach the knock out stage
917177 it is well known that in nigeria as around the world football is the number one sport and i find it very fitting that the number one candy in nigeria would be the official candy of our national teams in football
917178 stripped down instrumentation bold rhythmic roots and some of the most personal lyrics shes ever written
917179 it is doubtful that any one single event no matter how global iconic and well executed can succeed in healing such deep historical wounds
917180 the games are very short but what is left behind will last
917181 when there is a lack of spiritual vitality joy and zeal christianity drifts toward legalism adherents define themselves by what they dont do rather than by what they do and what they are christ followers
917182 im not sitting on the fence im lying on top of it
917183 we all agreed after the chicago result that this was not a must win game but a game were we had to put in a really strong performance and i think we did that
917184 i thought against chicago we played a little bit slow tempo which is not our way
917185 tonight we were more running forward passing forward and it was back to our old selves we showed a few glimpses that were coming back to form
917186 the saves tim made we think of as run of the mill now because hes such a quality keeper and hes definitely up there with the top the in the premier league now
917187 hes a really important part of our team now this club has had some great keepers over the past 30 years and he could be right up there with the best of them
917188 weve got four or five players now who really got to kick on and come up to speed to the 90 minutes that theyre going to be playing against blackburn
917189 because the players that are here regardless of who the manager brings in are probably going to be the team that starts against blackburn
917190 to suggest that everton will suddenly open its arms to any would be investor or buyer should the destination kirkby project be given a green light is wholly misleading simply because our chairman has made it clear at every agm going back five years that that kind of search has been going on consistently during that time and will continue to do so
917191 bill has never attempted to hide the fact that he does not have the funds to move the club to where he and the supporters want it to be at the forefront of the english game
917192 logic dictates that any club that can boast a stadium which is modern and capable of expansion will represent a more attractive proposition to investors however to suggest that there is some sort of link between confirmation of a move to kirkby and the prospect of serious negotiation with would be suitors is totally wrong
917193 the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know
917194 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well hell give us balance up front that were looking for
917195 i am here and intend to see the job through

917203 we were so lucky to have found remains that turned out to be a complete set of all the important parts
917204 towards the back nine i started missing those 4 footers and 5 footers
917205 i was wondering if i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself a putt
917206 but you know im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats what kind of happened today
917207 dissociative identity disorder did in case you were wondering wtf the title was about as defined by the american psychiatric associations diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a condition in which a single person displays multiple distinct identities or personalities each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment etc
917208 id like to put it off as long as possible because paid fire departments are expensive
917209 but because there is more to cover and because more and more we find that people are working over in st louis or somewhere else out of town we may not be able to avoid it forever
917210 right now were monitoring the situation and were getting good numbers out when we have a fire call
917211 in fact we have a waiting list of people who want to volunteer but i can see a day when were going to need help

917215 you set the goal and then set measurable ways to get that goal

917219 while other kids were playing t ball or soccer i was at the drag races
917220 my whole life ive always loved auto racing but ive sort of loved every other sport too
917221 i probably started liking sport psychology before i knew what sport psychology was its kind of a natural combination of the two things i find interesting
917222 im honored to have been able to do that for him
917223 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
917224 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
917225 estimates of maximum bite force for t rex are around 3 1 tonnes greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
917226 my nose was broken in about ten place and i fractured my cheek bone and i sprained my neck
917227 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
917228 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
917229 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
917230 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
917231 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
917232 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
917233 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia
917234 it shows what can happen when people are willing to work together for a common cause a common goal
917235 im looking forward to working together with the staff and the families just to create an exciting and nurturing learning environment
917236 it helps me envision where the students are heading both socially and academically
917237 i feel like i can see that and that will be helpful
917238 this year im really hoping to build a sense of family and community making everyone feel like its their school
917239 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
917240 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
917241 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area

917244 the refiling of the suit has asserted that the bush administration had circumvented the us constitution by authorizing wiretaps
917245 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
917246 its that time of the year and u s gulf production could be in the path of the storm
917247 concern about iran is coming to the fore and supply risks would provide a high floor for prices
917248 you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
917249 and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement

917260 we were approached by nikes head of european andre doxey in january 2007 with a view to start discussion on how we might help generate ideas and designs which could tell stories through iconic pieces of historic nike footwear
917261 some of the themes of these stories were seduced by innovation and recognise the original as well as creating designs and illustrations for application to the product ourselves we also selected and art directed third party creatives to help tell these stories
917262 we love illustration and as a consequence we know a lot of illustrators our a amp p project has also put us in touch with creatives all over the world we often dip into this archive to choose young often relatively unknown illustrators to collaborate with on projects
917263 there was two themes recognise the original and seduced by innovation these were concepts already developed at nike and was the starting point for exploration of the themes we then art directed our chosen illustrators to get designs that we could use
917264 mainly illustrator photoshop files but some illustrators still sketch with a pencil then scan them in for approval before working up the designs they were given a trainer template too but told to ignore it
917265 the product designers in nike create the fabrics we didnt really get involved the technical side of this we supplied them with illustrator and photoshop files
917266 the designs we have created are hitting the footlocker stores over the coming months and were applied to footwear for use as point of sale and online marketing items
917267 this isnt about definitions this about action on the ground to help these workers

917294 the number of visitors is large and the size of the reefs is limited and too small
917295 because of the increase in the number of visitors the coral reefs are unable to overcome the damage caused and are beginning to die out if we dont act quickly its only a question of time before the excellent breeding conditions in the north bay become barren many bodies are aware of the problem and are seeking a way to solve it
917296 within a year we will estimate whether the whole thing is a success or not and we will go on from there
917297 if all goes well then we will go to places where reefs used to be and actually build major large scale artificial reefs there we are trying to design a new environment all over the world reefs are being damaged and broken down we are trying to add surface area so far it looks like a great success the fish are coming and so are the people

917316 ive been doing shows like this for about five years and it helps people whove never had an experience with reptiles over their fears or misconceptions
917317 they dont make a lot of noise and if theyre taken care of properly and handled properly they can be just as friendly as a cat or a dog
917318 our focus for reptile weekend is on the conservation and preservation of reptiles and amphibians
917319 these are greatly misunderstood creatures and with this event we are able to connect people with these animals to help make a difference guests truly will find their fears fading to fascination after attending this unique event
917320 i can handle some of the reptiles but not the snakes
917321 hunter catches snakes behind our house and hes taking care of a bearded dragon for the summer
917322 we talk with people a lot about the importance of care and conservation
917323 we tell people if they want a pet turtle or snake to make sure they get it from a breeder and not from the pond or field behind their house reptiles born in the wild often dont last as pets but captive bred animals are used to being handled and likely will be healthier as pets
917324 we get a lot of people who have never touched a snake and before they leave here theyre actually petting them
917325 ive always had an interest in reptiles and everybody i know who has an interest in them has had it for as long as they can remember
917326 hearing aids require maintenance we ask people to come in every four or five months just to have them checked cleaned having the tubing changed its just an ongoing care
917327 this is the infamous tubing threader im just having a hard time tubing it
917328 a long time there are probably very few people in battle creek we havent seen ive been in practice 20 years over 20 years in battle creek we do most of the testing here we also provide audiology services over at the family health center when dr schwarz is seeing patients we go over there
917329 i guess a couple things i enjoy working with people first off secondly i enjoy working with the instrumentation this isnt so much but working with diagnostics and working with hearing aids ive seen a lot of change a lot of advancements in hearing aids over the years
917330 i happened to take a class in introduction to audiology and it was like this is it i found it the diagnostic tools are like looking at the cockpit of an airplane all these dials and instruments it just looked like so much fun
917331 ive read of it i havent fit a cat or a dog yet this is an aside but i remember seeing a hearing aid made for a dog and i dont know if youve looked like in a german shepherds ear
917332 oh yeah yeah its got all these crevices and fjords i dont know how they did it
917333 the most common cause of hearing loss is time typically its very very gradual other things that can effect hearing could be high fevers or toxic drugs or ear infections just prolonged exposure to high intensity noises
917334 oh i dont want to count youd think after 35 years id be good at this
917335 the standard of practice when i went through school was a masters level right now the field is going through transition to a doctoral level
917336 with the world getting noisier everything from traffic to ipods its having more of an effect on peoples hearing so were seeing hearing loss at a younger age and permanent hearing loss
917337 it depends on the intensity how loud it is and higher frequencies tend to cause more hearing lost
917338 i just love the fact we did not give up
917339 it wasnt the best way to get the runner over but it worked out
917340 ill just tell all of you to say whatever you want and write whatever you want
917341 thats all ive got for you today you guys write about it you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever you want
917342 this team doesnt quit this bullpen has been so good its like every time we do stink it up its like theyre obligated to go out and do something and they do its incredible
917343 i was just trying to be aggressive and they hit the ball like they are supposed to when i make a mistake
917344 its tough guys battled back for us so its kind of frustrating they did that for us and we let them down pitching wise its tough
917345 some people have to do better or theyll be some changes
917346 its not a threat or anything i dont want to and hope i dont have to but thats just the way it is
917347 whats going on right now is not good enough its been disappointing from day 1
917348 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt
917349 you dont want to be in the hunt go home take an early vacation come back for spring training well bring some kids up to play
917350 we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are

917353 they want something that will make them live forever without any effort
917354 use your brain like you do your heart i think the standard advice is common sense
917355 yet as mark twain observed common sense aint that common
917356 maybe its just taking half hour breaks or walking around your building
917357 people who pay attention to their sleep health over their lives appear to live longer and healthier
917358 at the end of the day grandma was right get your sleep
917359 its like exercise it should be a regular part of your health maintenance
917360 make it part of your life just walk up a flight of stairs or park further from the store in the parking lot
917361 ive had four cycles of the zometa thus far and i feel good said joann williams 54 of st louis a volunteer in a study conducted at siteman cancer center
917362 there was a lot of anxiety going on knowing my mom had cancer my dad had cancer and now i have cancer
917363 those studies are both out and now were waiting for some more data to help confirm this is the true effect
917364 from what we can tell right now this could potentially be applied to all women
917365 my husband is astronomical he is the best man in the world
917366 if you are on a tight budget no need to panic
917367 there are inexpensive ways to get into and stay in shape
917368 the most beneficial equipment would be a set of resistance bands
917369 they come in different strengths light medium and heavy resistance to work your upper and lower body
917370 with ankle weights you can do a whole body workout and ladies can do all leg exercises
917371 while watching tv you can do hip extensions and build your glutes which we brazilians are famous for
917372 they worked for jack lalanne and they will do the same for you
917373 what i call a survival slimming effect since you are lifting your own body weight the body is forced to adapt in other words if you are heavy this type of exercise will encourage weight loss out of the sheer will to survive
917374 this makes the ball the swiss army knife of fitness
917375 dont spend time thinking about what you could have done should have done what you wish youd have done in the past
917376 think about what youre going to do where youre going and youre always looking ahead
917377 when i got here a year ago they were throwing papers into the dumpster and you know you shouldnt waste anything
917378 he was someone who started out with nothing but held onto everything
917379 every day hed walk around the neighborhood picking up things from the alleys and the streets
917380 because i need to make points to get into heaven
917381 when you live in a trailer home you cut half the grass on one side and half the grass on the other
917382 well a couple of women lived next to me and i cut their grass too and then i cut the grass on the other side
917383 i used to live on two acres and i needed this for exercise
917384 when he gets to his sons house before were out of the car unpacking hes cutting the grass
917385 once a woman in a wheelchair sat on the side and was moving with the music and i went and pushed her wheelchair onto the floor and we turned around and back and forth
917386 its unlikely that a change in incidents of this magnitude within a relatively short span of years would be due to some kind of genetic factor
917387 it is more likely that its some kind of environmental factor
917388 as soon as i see someone come into my office that i think is sick i immediately grab the sanitizer you can shake hands at business meetings and still protect yourself
917389 you could infect the whole office any reasonable person will understand that
917390 it might be of interest to take note of your neighbors hygiene practices so sharing of bacteria and yeast doesnt occur
917391 people do not keep to the disposal rules and the refrigerator is taking in food from many many different households
917392 i do not use hand sanitizers or antibiotics as i believe they weaken your immune system however im much more careful about office hygiene since my mouse sighting
917393 both the bullies and the victims have a very significant high probability of suffering from injuries self inflicted accidental and injuries that are perpetrated by others as compared to those who are not involved in bullying incidents
917394 hmmm who shall we blame for this countrys social breakdown
917395 i know lets blame it on those bloody teenagers you know the ones with the threatening hoodies and that
917396 he hasnt got many other tricks left in his locker he will need to have a cabinet reshuffle and he will need to make a success of the economic relaunch he has got planned otherwise the cabinet will be under heavy pressure to act the crunch time will be late this month
917397 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
917398 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
917399 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
917400 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
917401 problem is the material that weve provided to mr judge clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
917402 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
917403 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
917404 ne pleurez pas sur votre visage daujourdhui vous le regretterez dans 10 ans
917405 im so excited this is a brilliant opportunity for me as ive done lots of theatre but not much tv
917406 everyone at emmerdale has been so warm and welcoming its such a well established show and i cant wait to see what leyla gets up to
917407 rokhsaneh is a terrific actress and an exciting new addition to the cast leylas going to have some fun stirring up the factory
917408 they were filming in johnnys local and everyone was stunned to see him
917409 they went over to chat and johnny asked if he could stay in the background drinking he thought it would be funny
917410 but they said there was no way he could be in shot as they would get in trouble so he went home with a takeaway
917411 johnnys always had a sense of humour but we couldnt raise baldwin from the grave
917412 my mum was the person i wanted to watch it and give me her absolute honest opinion
917413 after it she was choked up but said she thought id portrayed it well which was the biggest compliment
917414 women have stopped me in the street and even husbands whose wives have been through it
917415 im loving it its like being a little girl again getting to dress up in your mums cast offs
917416 i know parts of all the decades come in and out of fashion but you never get to wear an entire outfit exactly how it was some of my dresses are really out there
917417 one is an orange multi coloured mini dress with big cut out hoops around the midriff its phenomenal
917418 ive done a few dramas like strictly confidential and new street law and some radio like radio 4s the afternoon play so ive been very lucky
917419 about 15 years ago i turned down a previous offer to visit the street as elsie tanners long lost nephew but i chickened out
917420 she has a child a medical practice and still looks spectacular i just take my hat off to her i dont know how she does it
917421 i asked her if she had any tips and she gave me a really good piece of advice she told me to use the passion that i feel about acting and let it show in my character because martha would feel as passionate about helping people as i do about acting i could never see myself as a doctor
917422 martha has a totally different background to any of the characters ive played before im used to playing brash northern characters with an edge to them
917423 im quite a touchy feely person the directors were reminding me not to get so attached to stop waving my hands around i couldnt hug people it was hard to find that balance
917424 theres a real will they wont they tension between martha and robert that bubbles below the surface
917425 theyve been in a relationship before so they have a shared history and now theyre working together so it could either be completely disastrous or really wonderful if they do get together theres still sexual chemistry between them and hes a womaniser
917426 as soon as i leave my car mechanics who i pay very well because my car is in there every week have agreed to help me fulfil a dream of mine which is to do my apprenticeship
917427 im going to learn how to become a mechanic so i can build my own car and look after it
917428 im a big petrolhead i love racing and anything to do with cars so the opportunity to go and fulfil a hobby like that is great
917429 ive saved a bit of money so i can do an intensive course ill be able to know when i go to a car mechanic and they say something is wrong whether theyre telling lies
917430 you never know whether there is going to be another job after a show like eastenders
917431 hollywood is an ideal situation every actor would love to be going to there and making movies
917432 were delighted to have the opportunity to continue to support centrica as part of its project team and look forward to working together towards bringing grove and seven seas on stream
917433 unlike traditional company contractor relationships centrica and csl have worked in an arrangement where csl is regarded as an integral part of the operators team this has given us a genuine sense of ownership and has enabled us to fully represent our client throughout the delivery of this project
917434 in addition to our successful 2008 first half drilling programme we were delighted in june to receive strong institutional support for a further fund raising of 11 5 million which enables us to fully execute our planned 2008 drilling programme our focus on regional knowledge and 3d seismic data is proving to be successful and given our current momentum and recent capital infusion we intend to build upon these successes with ten additional wells scheduled to commence drilling before the end of 2008

917443 there is no safe way for students to cross icely or bathurst roads
917444 it has become a highly dangerous situation for students and needs to be addressed as soon as possible
917445 follow your dreams because theyre not out of reach everything is possible dream and dream big
917446 i think educating the kids on the need to know who you are where you came from and that your dreams are within reach is an important thing to teach
917447 as a facilitator i could be standing up there going on and on but what the kids will benefit from most is connecting with people who will share the experiences their successes and their ambitions
917448 if the one thing they take away from today is that they have a voice and the ability to get wherever they want to go then thats a great thing
917449 i cant see for the life of me how this could not be redesigned the walkway is at least three times the width of a normal driveway
917450 its fair to say some of the shrubs here that would need to go to make way for the changes are no horticultural marvel
917451 what we are asking is to designate half of the driveway for pedestrians and separate the other half with a small chain fence for disabled drivers to use to be able to park closer to the pool
917452 having to walk the 100 or so metres means they simply dont bother coming because it is simply not possible for them to do so people are missing out
917453 council has allocated 250 000 to design a new aquatic centre but they are not prepared to spend the money or even look at making some improvements to increase disabled access
917454 its very disappointing from the committees perspective who work very hard to have a logical suggestion knocked on the head just like that
917455 this is an event that doesnt come around very often
917456 weve got representatives ranging from cycling rowing hockey triathlon motorcycle racing and soccer
917457 mark has three junior world championship titles and just competed in the tour of france while toireasas off to the 2008 paralympic games in beijing

917490 the original idea was for users to be able to read and download comics for free but with advertisements now you can still read them online for free but to download them you have to pay some of the comics are as much as 3 99 more than most comics on the stand
917491 the interface is pretty terrible making it hard to read comics
917492 had issues with creator payments disgruntled employees and have come under an enormous amount of scrutiny by internet bloggers the world over their biggest problem has been their contracts which are basically viewed as intellectual property farms to bring in ideas to market to other media

917498 we are delighted to have worked with bt to put this innovative scholarship arrangement in place
917499 it provides a significant endorsement for the industrial relevance of our msc in telecommunications and internet systems which runs at the coleraine campus and is an example of how the university and industry can collaborate to address the skills shortages in the telecommunications sector on the island of ireland
917500 this scholarship scheme provides the opportunity of msc projects and the potential for full time employment with bt one of the worlds most innovative and research led companies and we welcome this mode of collaboration
917501 i have every sympathy for the families of david mcilwaine and andrew robb
917502 i can only begin to imagine the impact these dreadful offences have had on them
917503 but like the judge i can only assess the correctness of the sentence imposed on burcombe having regard to what he admitted to doing not what the families believe he may have done
917504 i understand where baroness scotland is coming from she can only work on the information she has
917505 depending on what happens in the trial shell look at it further i believe she can read between the lines but she can only go on whats being said
917506 as well as our own factory there were three others novus styles wrights and coleraine shirt company all of which closed at the turn of the millennium
917507 they employed between 300 and 400 but they are all gone my role now is to settle bills and try to sell off the machinery i did sell off some at rock bottom prices and the rest will simply be for scrap
917508 i checked with bangladesh pay and conditions four or five years ago and discovered workers were being paid 17p an hour and had no rights like holidays or holiday pay sickness pay a statutory working week pregnancy leave that sort of thing
917509 factories here simply cannot compete we held on as long as possible but the inevitable came it wound down bit by bit and simply became impossible at the end
917510 its very sad but a fact of life and the final winding down process is well advanced
917511 the problem is that all three centres required substantial investment to bring them up to modern standards and it may be better policy to replace all three with a state of the art centre
917512 cascades is virtually the only leisure facility portadown has remaining
917513 appointing four people with identical job descriptions no role definitions and no lines of accountability was organisationally inadvisable
917514 the recruitment process was a sham made without the necessary legislation in place for the position and that the appointments process breached equality and recruitment principles and procedures
917515 weve spent the day on the phone talking to our family in ireland and obviously our parents are devastated
917516 but we have been heartened and are grateful to so many strangers and friends in melbourne who have helped us through this ordeal
917517 we cant believe the kindness we have been shown by so many people who have expressed concern for stephen
917518 the wider irish community in melbourne for their tireless efforts during the last two weeks
917519 we respect differences of opinion but let us from now on talk politely to each other
917520 i was driving and there was a guy on top with a machine gun and a couple of guys at the side there were only a couple of others outside there were only two in the vehicle
917521 whenever we were flown in camp bastion we rang home that night my family didnt believe that i was ok because every time you hear about someone being blown up you think they have lost a limb or something worse
917522 what they found was that blood pressure fell by four millilitres in patients with high blood pressure
917523 this might be the difference of a drop from 145 to 140 which is not a huge difference to say that this could be as effective as drugs is not quite accurate i dont want to belittle the research but it appears to have the same effect as other lifestyle measures
917524 my gut feeling is that salt restriction is still more important rather than taking garlic as well as losing weight and increasing exercise
917525 people need to be aware that high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks strokes and kidney disease
917526 while i recommend cutting salt and establishing other lifestyle factors adding extra garlic may be relevant
917527 it looks like it could have an added lifestyle benefit but it might be equally achieved by dietary garlic rather than supplements
917528 he nearly killed me and i knew i had to get out before i ended up dead
917529 i took their bait patricia my wife said the others came out of trees
917530 there were about 16 altogether but around eight of them were attacking me even before i went to ground i could see the break
917531 when i was lying on the ground my wife was in hysterics the child ran up the street and got a neighbour to help
917532 he came down and it was him who got the ambulance they were still over shouting abuse and they threw bicycles at the ambulance
917533 there is no limit on the amount of sewage that can come out of these overflows they represent a licence to pollute
917534 it is imperative that we have good water quality for our marine life and for tourism and swimmers everyone needs to see clean beaches
917535 northern ireland prides itself on its wonderful scenery and nice environment but its a contradiction if its not as clean and wonderful as it should be
917536 i think the strong euro has been one of the reasons which is encouraging more people to travel across the border and spend their euros in northern ireland and particularly derry
917537 particuarly at this time people can get better value for their euro in northern ireland by travelling across the border
917538 the feedback from the shops is that there are quite a few people taking advantage of the extremely favourable exchange rate for the euro
917539 i quite often shop in sainsburys in newry or tesco in lisburn
917540 i usually come up every eight weeks and do a massive shop i buy mostly dried foods it costs around 650 but i am easily saving up to 40
917541 we have had a massive influx of over 10 of people coming from the republic
917542 were starting to hear a lot more southern brogues in belfast and especially newry probably because of the euro pound exchange
917543 we are probably seeing the biggest influx of cross border traffic in over 30 years
917544 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
917545 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka
917546 maybe i will receive good news about drogba and we have 12 days to train and maybe we will have something i dont expect
917547 i have quality competitive players and they fight for places on the pitch i have 22 here five at home
917548 when you net 30 goals in a season a lot of clubs come looking for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world and i have a big chance to have a good career at this club
917549 when there is a lot of speculation they the fans believe what they read in the newspapers the most important thing is to keep on enjoying your football
917550 he felt people questioned his commitment and the best answer you can give to that is on the pitch
917551 play well and show you are ready to fight for the shirt he does that and he is a man with character if you score goals then people forget quickly
917552 i like him but i also like two or three other players
917553 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches
917554 in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
917555 its huge because to win these tournaments is tough nowadays ive played five days in these conditions and had eight or nine matches in the last couple of weeks but ive put in the physical work and its paid off
917556 weve known each other since we were 14 and to think six or seven years ago wed have been playing in finals like this would have been unbelievable
917557 ive really enjoyed this week and im looking forward to coming back next year and defending my title
917558 there is no basis in economic theory or supporting evidence for the governments belief that by deflating demand they will bring inflation permanently under control and thereby induce an automatic recovery in output and employment
917559 the time has come to reject monetarist policies and consider urgently which alternative offers the best hope of sustained recovery
917560 if you dont have anything nice to say then dont say anything
917561 je moet je gezicht beter wassen ik kan zo zien wat je vanochtend gegeten hebt

917563 its got to be personal whatever you do it has to be personal
917564 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
917565 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
917566 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
917567 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
917568 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
917569 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
917570 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
917571 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients
917572 the teacher asked for a raise of 300 000 won 320 from her previous monthly pay of 2 million won and she left after i told her our financial situation does not allow that
917573 everyone says it will be harder to get english speaking teachers because of the new visa rules so teachers are asking for more pay
917574 two canadian teachers havent arrived because they do not have all the documents required for visa approval
917575 we cant even get temporary teachers because demand far outstrips the supply these days
917576 i promised them a raise but they said extending the visa is too time consuming and taxing
917577 they said they would rather move to other places like japan
917578 we used to recruit about 30 foreigners a month for private english schools but the number is down to just five since the visa change took effect
917579 i found just one teacher and that was after i increased the monthly wage by 500 000 won
917580 open the way for national competition authorities to take similar action

917582 a woman died when you were young someone close to you im also hearing something about a dress
917583 f k off back to connemara where you come from
917584 ryanair has been attacking me and my business for the past two years their strategy is to close down regional airports and aer arann
917585 so i called a meeting with him some months back to ask him face to face about what he was doing
917586 his airline has about 55 million passengers but theyre focusing on a small little airline with one million passengers it doesnt seem to add up for me that he is putting so much time and energy in to that
917587 so i rang him up last year and i said can i meet you to see what the story is and to see what youre at here
917588 thats when he told me that hed give me a bit of advice and said why dont you fuck off back to connemara where you came from then he said in no uncertain terms that he was going to take my business out and either take over or do the same to aer lingus
917589 i took it to mean that this is the situation and that this is the aim in other words if you cant stand the heat then get out of the kitchen and i think that was just his way of putting it
917590 i wasnt surprised by his comments he has made ruder remarks in his time but i just think that if this is the image of the irish business person abroad because he is a world class airline manager then thats certainly not a good thing
917591 what really hurt me was the way he pretended to play the fiddle the connemara remark didnt damage or hurt me but the fiddle thing was crazy
917592 i was just asking him what his strategy was what was he was trying to do what was his beef with aer arann and he told me he doesnt have beef with aer arann
917593 i said michael youve 700 routes ive only 40 but youre focusing on my key 40 routes i said to him its about you competing with me rather than me competing with you and then thats when he started pretending to play the fiddle he did that on two or three occasions during the meeting i got very frustrated but i didnt say anything to him i realised it was probably a mistake for me to go and meet the guy there was no point on arguing with him
917594 i came up one stairs to meet with him and afterwards i was walking down the stairs and he said no ill walk you out
917595 i felt that was the reason because i had said to him ill go out this way ill go out this way the way i came in and he replied ah no no no well go out this other way and he walked me the long way around through the office
917596 he uses a lot of bullying tactics towards aer arann but im not worried about it worrying is not a productive pastime ive a tsunami hitting me and thats ryanair and i have to do what i have to do to protect my business and survive this tsunami
917597 but all thats not withstanding that we are in extremely difficult and challenging times
917598 its just very unfortunate that a fellow irishman is trying to close me down the future is looking tough and there are some very challenging times ahead a lot of things have gone against us fuel is the big thing and i dont know what will happen with the economy well have to just wait and see but i believe aer arann is reasonably solid in the current climate and we are looking forward to maintaining our position as one of the top european airlines
917599 i was taken aback but you have to have a tough skin in this business i want michael oleary to know that you can take the man out of connemara but you cant take the connemara out of the man and i aint giving up easily
917600 i dont want it to get personal between myself and him i dont want to throw stuff at him in the media im not interested in a media war with michael oleary
917601 i think its important to say that in relation to the success that michael oleary has achieved with ryanair its unparalleled
917602 i think he has created a huge success out of the airline and i very much admire that and i wish him and the team in ryanair well and even more continued success
917603 i have huge respect for what michael oleary has achieved but i think he needs to realise that ryanair could be a lot more successful if their style was more ethical and not simply a my way or the highway approach you dont make money by screwing everyone around you
917604 f k off back to connemara where you came from
917605 padraig o ceidighs claim that he called a meeting with michael oleary in recent months is entirely untrue
917606 michael oleary has had no request from padraig o ceidigh for a meeting in recent months and nor has any such meeting been called or taken place during the last seven months of 2008
917607 michael oleary is disappointed by these latest false claims by padraig o ceidigh which are sadly consistent with the false claims padraig o ceidigh recently made to irish entrepreneur magazine
917608 why would anyone want to spend 299 465 on this totally unclear just like the entire eee pc lineup

917611 there are of course many reasons why people procrastinate self doubt boredom fear of failure the feeling of being unready or unprepared and so on but these feelings by themselves dont necessarily lead to procrastination often what tips the scales is going through them alone with no one to help you bolster you or cheer you on

917615 why does the boston globe still feel its necessary to suck up to gov patrick
917616 in light of the recent supreme court ruling this new proposal from the governor can only be viewed as an attempt to tax people out of their civil rights
917617 with this new proposal the governor continues to demonstrate his willingness to attack lawful gun owners while doing nothing to reduce violent crime the highest court in the nation has ruled that citizens have an individual right to possess a firearm and now our governor is trying to tax us out of that right

917625 i think we can lift the cap when we fix the funding formula and its broken right now t he state has to step up and provide the kind of funding that makes both charter schools and district schools flourish

917640 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
917641 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
917642 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

917679 i am definitely going to hand over 10 percent of the prize to the church for the wonderful things the lord god has done to me
917680 it was not by choice that i am an idol today and i feel i should give back to the lord to bless my fruits
917681 from here i will be going to joburg to record my single this is everything to me and from there i will also tour several african countries promoting my products
917682 i have been writing songs throughout my life and it would not take a long time to record one as artistes we always compose and i have been doing that myself
917683 i think we managed to tell the true story of zimbabwe as we dominated in the contest
917684 we also convinced those that were looking down upon us that we were also capable of achieving something big despite our challenges
917685 i am really behind that music they need to be recognised for their artistry because they are doing something for their livelihood
917686 i am also willing to work with some of them if they need my expertise
917687 i dont think there is a problem in that to me waking up rich like what has just happened is an opportunity that has presented itself to me

917737 for over a week i tried to get hillary clintons campaign and senate staff to issue a policy statement reflecting her position on her potential future use of pmcs in iraq if she won the presidency
917738 where was her call for a ban after nisour square
917739 from this wars very beginning this administration has permitted thousands of heavily armed military contractors to march through iraq without any law or court to rein them in or hold them accountable these private security contractors have been reckless and have compromised our mission in iraq the time to show these contractors the door is long past due we need to stop filling the coffers of contractors in iraq and make sure that armed personnel in iraq are fully accountable to the u s government and follow the chain of command
917740 obama seems to be confident enough in his lead that he can risk political fallout of the acknowledgment that whoever becomes the next president will have little choice but to continue reliance upon contracted security
917741 has been implicated in a variety of human rights abuses around the globe

917767 apparently these contracts and contracts are offered as nobid openned multihundred million dollars awards to cronies klans and cabals beholden to the bush government without review or recouse without the peoples best interests involved and accountable to no one for abuses fraud financial malfeasance and crimes against humanity
917768 at least on the ncs side of cia im not so sure that this is true at least from what i can see and i can see quite a bit many if not most of the ncs contracts for clandestine humint collection and covert action are let to smaller specialized companies that few outside of the intelligence community have heard of save for dr hillhouse
917769 are these us employed contractors loyal and accountable to america and the american people or to those individuals or entities choosing the contractors and awarding the contracts
917770 it seems that the private military company and private intelligence company industries are in dire need of examination review and regulation
917771 from my pedestrian perspective i see billions of the peoples dollars funnelled into black holes with no accounting no review no recourse and no remedy for abuse or criminal conduct and with suspect and highly questionable results

917824 today organizations around the world are being compelled by their employees their customers consumers and their supply chain partners to undertake green initiatives but although they are caught in a deluge of information and opinions about the importance of being green they find much less information and advice about the beginning let alone maintaining an effective green shift in operations sourcing lies at the nexus of a number of functions and business units and is therefore in a position to influence action across an organization it can be a strong leverage point for starting a green initiative by working with senior leaders in other functions sourcing executives enable a successful holistic multifunctional strategy for reducing environmental impact while cutting costs and building better relationships with suppliers and communities they can do so by making gradual improvements and continually making the green initiative more relevant to the companys overall strategy green sourcing is not a departure from the way sourcing is currently being practiced its a augmentation when considering the trade offs between one material service or supplier and another the sourcing function has traditionally measured the value of each by analyzing either the economics of the deal or the deals impact on the customer green sourcing starts with the same consideration but it also takes into account the environmental impact of a particular choice be it transportation materials energy source or packaging design on the ecological footprint made by a product or service

917982 this meeting puts on record its unalterable conviction that the maintenance of british rule in india not only a titular supremacy but a vigorous force permeating every branch of the administration is an absolute and paramount necessity it therefore expresses its strong denunciation and abhorrence of the recent attempts made in this province by some political fanatics to weaken that supremacy by speeches and writings tending to foster racial animosity between europeans and indians in this country further it resolves by all the means in its power to prevent the rise and growth of the spirit of sedition and insubordination among all classes of his majestys subjects in the deccan and particularly among the followers of islam

917989 sir william willcock a distinguished hydraulic engineer whose name was associated with irrigation enterprises in egypt and mesopotamia had made an investigation of conditions in bengal he had discovered that innumerable small destructive rivers of the delta region constantly changing their course were originally canals which under the english regime were allowed to escape from their channels and run wild formerly these canals distributed the flood waters of the ganges and provided for proper drainage of the land undoubtedly accounting for that prosperity of bengal which lured the rapacious east india merchants there in the early days of the eighteenth century he wrote
917990 sir william willcock severely criticizes the modern administrators and officials who with every opportunity to call in expert technical assistance have hitherto done nothing to remedy this disastrous situation from decade to decade

918003 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
918004 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
918005 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
918006 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately

918013 i have a pretty significant bruise in my left quad

918017 they have a real good lineup and theyre playing well and theyve been especially good at home
918018 i thought the one with hunter that he looked up but couldnt find the ball thats a tough read
918019 carlos made the right read but over slid the base
918020 ive always known that arm strength was there and im sure he was a little bit rusty
918021 i thought he threw the ball well well use him in the seventh or eighth especially when they have the middle of the order or some tough righthanded hitters coming
918022 when i came in here i told the guys this is a really good team
918023 i know theyve been frustrated by how the year has gone but you look around this team can win

918025 our bullpen has been real solid the last month or so guys have fallen into rolls they need to be in sampson in particular has been extremely good
918026 in my view that is the wrong issue the question is not whether the definition of employee is wide enough to include those without a valid contract of employment but whether courts ought to sanction or encourage illegal conduct
918027 basically it is bad economic data in the us dictating whats happening with global markets
918028 a view is that a global slowdown is obvious maybe even a recession and thats knocking commodity prices and we see the reaction in our commodity shares
918029 these are expected to be under pressure given the tighter monetary policy
918030 when sentiment is low bad news gets exaggerated investors should stick to the basics buy low price earning and high dividend paying stocks

918032 the combined effect of weak demand and high cost pressures is severely constraining manufacturing sector activity
918033 the deterioration in the outlook for both domestic and global demand implies at best a slow and protracted recovery of the sector
918034 the july pmi reading and the weak reading in june is a fairly strong indication that manufacturing output will contract in the third quarter

918101 call this lawsuit what it really is a publicity stunt and it still concerns me
918102 because it inspires others to conceive similar legal crackpot cases just for the sake of attacking our faith whether such cases are legit or reasonable doesnt matter they still attract the media and provide these people a bully pulpit
918103 obviously this is a frivolous publicity stunt but this is a portent of things to come
918104 we know that the homosexual activists are now targeting essentially born again christians and committed catholics and mormons who oppose their agenda theyre out to re write the bible to say that the bible really does not condemn homosexual practice which it obviously does

918112 the armoured brigade had been blocked by two squadrons of pattons and in the first encounter had lost more tanks than the enemy had the worst consequence of the days battle was its paralysing effect on the minds of the higher commanders it took them another 48 hours to contemplate the next move this interval gave pakistanis time to deploy their 6th armoured division in fact the golden opportunity that fate had offered to the 1st armoured division to make worthwhile gains had been irretrievably lost

918118 psychologists often talk about the first three years of life as being very important in the emotional development of children our current understanding of prenatal psychology has made many realize that the environment in utero is an important part of a babys well being yet when it comes to adoption there seems to be a black out in awareness there is a kind of denial that at the moment of birth and the next few days weeks or months in the life of a child when he is separated from his mother and handed over to strangers he could be profoundly affected by this experience what does it mean that we have for so long ignored this how many of us remember very much about the first three years of our lives does our lack of memory mean that those three years had no impact on us our personalities perceptions and attitudes how many sexually abused children remember those experiences are we to believe that if a person can successfully keep those experiences from consciousness they will not affect his or her future relationships in the case of abuse we certainly recognize that there is indeed a profound lifelong effect on the person an effect which often requires years of therapy to overcome yet what if the most abusive thing which can happen to a child is that he is taken from his mother
918119 our emotional brain is the seat of all relationship and is involved in memory recalling what we know we learn by relating something unknown to something we know even the abstract capacity for associative thinking whether scientific mathematical or philosophical though dependent on our third brain has its foundation in the feeling state of the old mammalian brain between our emotional cognitive old mammalian and sensory motor reptilian lies two critical modules the amygdala is involved in recording our earliest emotional and survival experiences and learning in the first three years of life an activity that functions beneath our awareness thereafter and largely shapes the way we respond to events

918123 frankly one can get rid of the element of chance by doing good research
918124 i personally spend at least 2 hours a day researching casino computer programmer volunteers trends and buying activity while watching the latest sell reports from stansfield keplin investment firm inc when i put all this information together i have a better idea of how to allocate my casino computer programmer volunteers monies and portfolio following this step and keeping with the advice of kushi skinkle the successful investor will augment casino computer programmer volunteers shares returning a yield of 7 or better while minimizing losses from lower end performers timing is crucial in this step if you get out too soon youll risk missing a possible market spike but if you hold too long you may miss the seasonal changes in the casino computer programmer volunteers market and be stuck holding the bag until another buying cycle starts
918125 look this isnt some 30 second sound byte promising you a life of wealth and luxury without any work you have to work hard in this casino computer programmer volunteers field and that is the only way to become a success
918126 i started out following all the zany and crazy ideas i could find that promised a quick buck
918127 you dont have to be a millionaire to make cash when dealing with casino computer programmer volunteers securities
918128 most successful traders start with as little as one thousand dollars and slowly build from there
918129 as a casino computer programmer volunteers tax consultant i always recommend disciplined record keeping it is the only way to be sure that you can get the most out of your casino computer programmer volunteers capital investments while at the same time saving money on what you owe uncle sam

918133 and in this case mr ramos and his co defendant at the time the sheriff turned information over to ice pursuant to that sanctuary ordinance
918134 if the federal authorities had done their job then maybe things would have been different
918135 there are documents that go back and forth between the sheriff and ice that show that they actually did recognize the correspondence from the sheriff turning over information
918136 which only reinforces the fact that both of those individuals information was turned over about them when they were arrested in march
918137 dianne feinstein signed a resolution at the board of supervisors i think it was 1985 december
918138 and it was a principled thing to do the reason that this city was declared a city of refuge was because of the horrors and travails associated with what was happening in central america guatamala el salvador and elsewhere
918139 that was the beginning of the city of refuge sanctuary movement throughout the united states of america
918140 it began in the middle 1980s it has evolved in the 90s and it has evolved in the last number of years
918141 and the evolution is directly connected with the failure of the federal government
918142 the failure of congress and the failure of the president of the united states to address comprehensively the issue of immigration
918143 as a consequence the cities of refuge have become sanctuary cities
918144 we are not the only city of refuge we are not the only sanctuary city in the united states were certainly not the only one in california
918145 were not the only one in the bay area you have to look no further than san raphael or oakland san jose
918146 you go to los angeles there are 15 cities in los angeles county 15 cities in los angeles county that are sanctuary cities
918147 both large and small new york city baltimore detroit chicago all of them sanctuary cities
918148 and they all became sanctuary cities on a principle of public safety
918149 the idea is that if someone is worried about their safety they can feel like they can safely report a crime
918150 that a loved one may have been attacked that they safely can report that crime to law enforcement
918151 that was the purpose the genesis behind the city of refuge movement that began in the 80s that evolved in the 90s and into this decade
918152 i think the sanctuary movement has saved lives that otherwise were feeling threatened by sending a daughter or son to the hospital that may have acute appendicitis because they were worried about a family members immigration status
918153 that was the idea behind the sanctuary city movement safety public safety
918154 its been codified by over 130 plus cities across america
918155 i believe in its principles and purpose and have stated so on many occasions and i will state it again today
918156 the idea that someone from an organization loosely calling themselves the minutemen would come out here and call for resignation begs the question
918157 when every big city in this country has addressed the
918158 we deal with reality in a reality based world when we run cities and as a consequence that reality is not as rosey as the one they want to paint up there in the sanctity of and safety in the halls of congress and in the white house
918159 we deal with that reality in a thoughtful way in a compassionate way a strategic way and thats what weve done in san francisco for years
918160 we had a loophole for years as well as it relates to maintaining a similar strategy as it relates to people that commit crimes under our sanctuary protection
918161 a loophole existed for decades in san francisco as it relates to juveniles
918162 it wasnt closed earlier because i was not familiar with it but im not convinced many people were aware of it around here
918163 the juvenile justice system where theres a different set of rules that were organized
918164 it was never to be a shield to break laws that was never its purpose and principle thats not why it was ever conceived of the city of refuge in 1985 or a sanctuary city shortly thereafter
918165 it was for public safety purposes so if you come here under the aegis of a sanctuary city and you commit a felony as an adult we have protocols to turn you over we think thats appropriate
918166 i havent seen a lot of people protesting in the last 18 months those 1 100 people that have been turned over i have not seen any protests to my knowledge
918167 so we want a similar protocol for juveniles ive acknowledged that
918168 i also think that its time certainly to review the sanctuary city ordinance and its protocols because when you look back at the history of it its a very convoluted history
918169 you have resolutions like the ones that senator feinstein signed you have ordinances like the ones previous mayors have signed that i signed you have oral history where someone said this and someone else said that
918170 you have memos going back to 92 versus 94 theres a memo in 96 theres a juvenile adult probation memo
918171 last week i had ed lee the city administrator and i had kevin ryan the director of the mayors office of criminal justice begin a comprehensive analysis of the sanctuary ordinance

918200 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
918201 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
918202 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on

918252 non potevo correre e affaticarmi non potevo giocare quando faceva troppo caldo non potevo fare niente mi portavano a scuola mi riprendevano mi davano da mangiare e poi non mi rimaneva che la sala buia e fresca dei cinema del quartiere io adoravo i film di qualsiasi genere e quando poi giunse il technicolor per me fu un momento magico ancora di pi di quando arriv il cinecolor tutto quello che avrei fatto dopo nel cinema io lo vedo come un costante ritorno alla memoria sensuale di quella magia che emanava il grande schermo quando assistevo ai primi b movies di hollywood con il colore ancora sgranato e lerba che blu come i campi di barbabietole quella magia che ancora adesso mi seduce e ammalia
918253 pi che un giallo uno studio caratteriale e il racconto di un periodo fondamentale nella psichiatria
918254 il film ambientato negli anni 50 perch in quegli anni almeno in america avvenne lo scisma tra due scuole di psichiatria diametralmente opposte una faceva perno sullaggressiva medicalizzazione del disturbo psichico inclusi lelettroshock e la lobotomia a new york cera perfino un laboratorio ambulante per eseguire lobotomie seduta stante laltra scuola quella progressista rappresentata nel film dallo psichiatra interpretato da ben kingsley si opponeva a questi metodi barbarici e allutilizzo di droghe pesanti considerati lequivalente di un suicidio dellanima lapproccio scientifico di questa scuola ha trasformato la psichiatria da quella sorta di tortura medievale che era prima a una vera e propria terapia che umanizzava la cura dei matti insomma per me questo film aspira ad essere un dramma umano con suspense ma a sfondo scientifico

918278 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
918279 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
918280 i hope and pray hes sitting on a barstool somewhere with his dad arguing about baseball and his mom and his brother who he misses dearly i hope hes at peace because i know he wasnt the last couple years and he battled and fought and didnt do a whole lot of complaining he knew he wrote some checks that were getting cashed and he didnt complain about it once
918281 you know intellectually that youre exhausted but so what concentrate on the game i know this im not going to embarrass myself if i cant do this ill be the first to know it ive had a hell of a run so ive got nothing to complain about if i die tonight ive had a great life
918282 the bases are loaded again and i wish i was too
918283 ive just kind of grabbed on to the people of atlanta and theyve made me feel at home

918288 we dont want to get all maudlin here but thank you folks and god bless you and were going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us
918289 ive got to be able to say ive worked with all of them

918295 if you take an overall call on the telecom sector if the investors have not invested into the stock and wants to make a fresh entry probably there are two sides of the same coin i need to view this investment from a different angle that if you see the likely interest of bharti getting revived in mtn probably that will be negative for the stock because we have seen the fate of rcom the process they have initiated the talk of mtn till the talks were concluded there has been an erosion of about usd 9 million probably market is not too happy with these kinds of acquisitions
918296 also when we have the 3g allocation going on probably bsnl mtnl was assured of that allotment they are good buy in this juncture obviously if i take a call on the comparative stock in the same peer in rcom and idea cellular who also has been expanding quite a lot on a pan india basis probably they are looking more attractive in terms of the valuation because right now the bharti is ruling at a pe multiple of about maybe 18 19 times based on q1 earnings i e on fy09 earnings so taking those things i may not advise making fresh entry at these levels because it all depends on so many things or the developments which are likely to take place over next maybe one quarter or so so my advice is that those who are holding the investments can remain invested but not the fresh entry to be made at these levels

918298 reliance communications has taken a beating or maybe a correction of about rs 75 post declaration of its june quarter results i do not think that kind of correction was warranted because the growth of these telecom companies coming in in the form of increase in subscriber obviously the arpu will go down because now they are taking their shift or increasing their presence to the rural areas and that has happened with reliance communications also now the policy getting announced and the cdma player will get the automatic allocation of 3g obviously that will be advantageous for rel comm
918299 considering all these when i compare bharti airtel vis vis rcom i think rel comm comes at an attractive valuation as compared to bharti because the kind of growth which we have been witnessing in the topline and bottomline and maybe the subscriber base i may not touch on the arpu for time being is all more or less equal for both the companies both are increasing their presence at a rapid pace in time to come the company has given capex of about rs 40 000 50 000 crore since they have called off their mtn acquisition deal the fund available at their disposal or leveraging by their balance sheets can give them good headway for making capex at a high level my advice is remains invested probably a rise of rs 70 75 from this level can be seen

918301 we were looking for a way to commemorate the 40 years in business and members of our team came across the high line
918302 its an artistic installation and its in new york city so its near our roots just a few blocks from offices where calvin and barry schwartz kleins business partner first started their business we have a big global business today but we never forget where we started right here in new york city
918303 its the biggest park installation in manhattan in probably three decades
918304 if we can raise awareness in addition to contributing a sizeable amount of money to get the project up and running then we think we have done something good for new york city
918305 they were extremely interested and worked hard with us to get the appropriate permissions to make this happen
918306 were both after the same result for nearly a decade and a half its been extraordinary working as a team to achieve it
918307 philanthropic donations from companies such as calvin klein inc help to ensure the long term maintenance and care of the high line so that it can be enjoyed by new yorkers for generations to come

918310 i need some fine wine and you you need to be nicer
918311 the best way i can put it is that i like simpler coldplay it just feels like theyre trying to be something that theyre not right now the indie rock prog rock good call adriene feel just doesnt fit what coldplay was sure that sounds like the old fan wishing their band hadnt grown up and changed their sound ill cop to that but some of their earlier songs made me want to cry now their new stuff does that but for different reasons

918330 das hauptproblem momentan sind die eltern sie suchen in ihrer verunsicherung einen strohhalm an den sie sich klammern k nnen weil sie alles richtig machen wollen sie wissen allerdings nicht wie man es richtig macht
918331 werden diese bed rfnisse nicht erf llt k nnen kinder ihre potentiale nicht mehr entfalten und keine bindungsf higkeit oder positives selbstbild herstellen
918332 kinder m ssen sich als wirksam empfinden bemerken dass sie etwas bewirken k nnen das ist wohl das aller wichtigste was man kindern mitgeben kann und das kann man nicht lehren sondern man muss den kindern die m glichkeit geben es selbst zu erfahren
918333 die botschaft hei t also wir m ssen mehr daf r tun dass unsere kinder 15 mnuten auf einen marshmallow warten k nnen
918334 wenn einmal negative erfahrungen zum beispiel in bezug auf das lernen erfahren wurden reicht es nicht mehr durch berzeugungsarbeit etwas daran zu ndern das geht nur durch neue positive erfahrungen

918349 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
918350 it maybe a very good time to enter bharti airtel provided you are looking at a minimum of six quarters so that is a kind of timeframe i look at in bharti for people who do not have it in their portfolio and want to include it at the present juncture i think support is strong at rs 695 as of now and resistance would come at rs 870 so it is likely to consolidate between these two parameters in the coming couple of weeks or months and unless you see a breakout above rs 870 with very forceful volumes and tremendous expansion in the open interest it would tell me that strong upmove are mere technical pullbacks so momentum players or people who want to make sure that the stock is actually ready to take off may actually buy once the rs 870 hurdle has been taken off fairly convincingly for people who are looking at value buying or buying at lower levels closer one gets to rs 725 the better it is for the investor

918354 they attempted to remove two vehicles there they said they were abandoned but they were our vehicles
918355 we went to try to prevent them from taking them and entering the site
918356 we raised this concern with their representatives yesterday and their response was to increase the number of vehicles obstructing this gate
918357 officers therefore sought to provide clear access to allow safe evacuation or access for emergency vehicles should this become necessary
918358 protesters have actively tried to prevent police from doing this
918359 however the response from protesters including those who have locked on to the vehicles causing the obstruction has required us to increase our presence on the site
918360 we are very keen on hearing the views of local residents and visitors on our plans and on details such as what colour the lifts should be painted

918366 youve got a good solid feel of what you should expect but it has its disadvantages if you want to try to negotiate something on the side or go around the book a little bit

918397 rights holders should be aware that these non traditional venues are stubbornly entrenched incredibly popular and will never go away
918398 its time to stop swimming against the tide of what people want
918399 the expectation among rights holders is that in order to create a success story you must reduce the rate of piracy weve found that is not the case

918405 for us to be a global company we need a global identity to unite all our operations under one banner
918406 with mergers and acquisitions you have to be clandestine as we speak we are considering two or three merger and acquisition opportunities
918407 thats not to say we are not acquirable in fact we welcome anyone who would like to acquire us but it will not be easy
918408 all this year either shes won some or ive won some
918409 its a really healthy competitive relationship i think we both welcome it because it just makes us better athletes in the end
918410 it was so much fun running because there was so much fog
918411 i had no idea when the race was going to end or how far id gone i thought it was cool
918412 one of the big reasons i do this race is so my relatives get a chance to see me race
918413 having that family support is awesome my grandma actually lives right under the bridge so i just walked over here today
918414 when i found out it was going this way i was very thankful
918415 the hill at the start on the halifax side is hard but 400 metres of hill is a lot better than 1 000 metres of hill
918416 here against a good solid canadian field it was fun to come and race here and thankfully i was able to win
918417 im not very race sharp when he surged there was just nothing left i dont think i could have beat him but i would have liked to let him know i was there at least
918418 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
918419 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
918420 there are so many and they are playing so good so consistent
918421 i need to improve i learned a lot this week and im going to prepare for the next part of the season
918422 last year gave me a little more confidence that i can play with anybody
918423 but its so day to day with golf you just have to make sure youre good at the right time
918424 its such a stupid game one day you have it the next day you dont some days are good some days are bad i just have to make sure its working for me at the right time
918425 things really came together after i got the nerves out of the way early
918426 thats what i did at clare so hopefully it works a second time around
918427 you have to get to know the course if you go down blind and have never played it before it could be trouble
918428 when i got him to settle early he just got into a galloping kind of pace and they just left him alone
918429 when he straightened up in the laneway he accelerated underneath me and i knew we had a big shot
918430 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
918431 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
918432 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
918433 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
918434 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
918435 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
918436 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
918437 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
918438 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
918439 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
918440 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
918441 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
918442 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
918443 i came onto the court thinking ok its not going to be an easy match
918444 i would say i was more experienced in finals and it paid off
918445 i hit some good shots and in the crucial moments she gave me some good mistakes that i could say thank you and that helped me win in two sets
918446 its just unbelievable its a first time experience for me
918447 normally if i win a tournament the next week id always lose in the first round
918448 when i won my first match i thought ok its better than the previous times then i just took it one match at a time
918449 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished i played better
918450 i wanted to have a good match against dinara in the rallies i didnt play the way i wanted i was scared to make a mistake thats why i was standing behind the baseline it was not all good today but that happens
918451 to be no 1 in the world you have to win a grand slam
918452 there you have to play your best tennis for two weeks theres so much more emotion in a grand slam i think i still have to get stronger mentally and fitness wise i just want to be healthy and take one step at a time and lets see if i ever can make it
918453 now i have enough confidence to believe in myself so we will see
918454 this was my best week ever and i really enjoyed it
918455 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
918456 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
918457 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately

918459 its all about the wind here our members do well in provincial tournaments because they can play in the wind on a calm day you can score really well here but when the winds blow it makes things much tougher
918460 on the front the 329 yard no 4 is extremely tough while on the back side the 346 yard no 17 is challenging the wind especially near the river makes it very difficult
918461 the superintendent whos been here from day 1 said the greens have never been any better they are absolutely perfect the whole course is in great shape
918462 my elder son irshad could not continue his studies because he got psychologically disturbed by his fathers death
918463 my husband was fighting for the party of abdul gani lones militant leader peoples conference all men who fought here as militants and got killed had full faith in lone sahib but after my husband s death i had no means of livelihood or survival i not even had the money to buy shroud for my husband villagers collected money and bought shroud for my husband i cant afford to bring up my six daughters and i go and beg in the town i have returned from begging
918464 dozens of men in the army camp abused us physically we were hardly provided adequate meals they even ignored our stage of pregnancy this not only led to complications in our delivery but also lead to the death of my child who was stillborn shmalis child died a few hours after birth
918465 since that day shamli is abnormal her mental condition deteriorated due to shock i have registered a case against army in the handwara police station on 30 th june 2000 we were threatened of dire consequences by the rr men if we filed a case i was even bribed by the unit with a sum of rs10 000 for maintaining silence i refused the money and filed the case
918466 i will never forget the humiliation we have faced at the hands of our house owners in jammu all this happened after our internal displacement from kashmir in 1989 our family was not allowed to carry the dead body in the owners house and we were not allowed to condole the death of our dear ones what we faced in these 16 years only we know

918519 move along wont you youll have all night to enjoy the town for now weve got to get to an apartment old girlfriend of mine set one up for us free of charge on one condition
918520 i have to do that thing she likes with my tongue

918522 give me your soul and it wont hurt at all
918523 why the hell you freakin out you fell asleep playing that song you never quit playing
918524 man i must be bat shit crazy then i swear i had the craziest dream j just dont fucking leave the room okay
918525 okay but if you ask me for a kiss i will have to decline its already suspicious enough with us rooming together
918526 jon and kate plus 8 i cant wait to see them in november
918527 movie together this christmas that works out perfectly for me
918528 its a tremendous amount of money out of peoples pockets
918529 people can cut back on heating to some extent if it gets too expensive but theres obviously a floor beyond which they cant go to keep themselves in their homes without freezing
918530 maybe the people who are very very wealthy wont bat an eyelash but for the regular people who are working from paycheck to paycheck and week to week and dont have anything in the bank account this is devastating
918531 people ask me how do you get by i sacrifice a lot of stuff
918532 i dont drink i dont smoke i dont go out
918533 any type of increase in cost especially of this magnitude is just going to make life so precarious so difficult perhaps even unlivable unless we can subsidize those households so that they can make it
918534 i cant even think about the next two winters its obviously a horror show in the making
918535 the good news is that people are talking about it now when the weather is 85 degrees
918536 i met him like a month and a half ago when we were doing a walk through in the house and its funny he mentioned that he was bringing his daughter here to live so i guess he thought he was not going to get caught
918537 he didnt make it seem like this was a way station
918538 it seems like he was setting up a life down there
918539 i have no doubt that he would have been right back in high society circles
918540 didnt figure out what he did but he seemed very bright definitely
918541 sort of like a madonna accent like a fake english accent
918542 its in such bad shape he would come out to see if it was still floating
918543 fraught with danger because the media covers them so aggressively and theres nothing going on
918544 they always sound great in the conference room but its where the sandals meet the sand the execution is always very difficult
918545 basically he was going and dedicating new tollbooths on the mass turnpike which hardly looked presidential
918546 there are two ways vacations can mess you up number one choice of location and number two of course is what you do when you get there
918547 he became a symbol of a simpler seemingly more virtuous america
918548 takes as much risk sneering at baseball baby mother the flag the home or the dog

918554 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
918555 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
918556 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
918557 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
918558 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
918559 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
918560 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
918561 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
918562 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
918563 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
918564 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
918565 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result

918571 despite this progress and strong growth in international geographies slowing performance in the us impacted top line revenue growth looking forward we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings from the opensolaris operating system and the mysql database to the lustre and zfs storage systems the foundation of our open storage platforms
918572 customs agents must have the ability to conduct even highly intrusive searches when there is reason to suspect criminal or terrorist activity but suspicionless searches of americans laptops and similar devices go too far congress should not allow this gross violation of privacy
918573 these examinations are part of cbps long standing practice and are essential to uncovering vital law enforcement information

918576 water as a business is very effective when you look at the needs we purify water and bring this water to your home we provide a service it has a cost and somebody has to pay for it
918577 investors need to be convinced that they will get reasonable returns the issues we consider include who the end users are and whether they are able to afford the water tariffs
918578 from a social point of view these kinds of projects are viable but unfortunately from a private sector point of view they are not

918588 we now have a presence of about 170 to 180 of the top 350 customers in south africa even though it has taken quite a long time for neotel to gain a comprehensive presence in the market we have been doing fairly well since launching our corporate services we have been blamed that we are not visible and through this ad south africans will now be able to see who we are and what we stand for
918589 the focus is to articulate neotels core vision to the outside world our task was to come up with the word that says who neotel is and what they aim to do which is to help south africans overcome the technology constrains they are faced with on a daily basis neotel promises to provide them what they never had before hence the pay off line we are often told what we cant do today we are telling you what you can do
918590 being so close to the loeries it was a funny month with some categories much weaker than others congrats to fox p2 for doing well in the tough radio category

918593 we just had a meeting on how to rescue this stalled project no one came up with any ideas for an hour it was like waiting to go see the dentist
918594 oh yeah they did just not in the meeting we wasted an entire hour only when the meeting was over i find out at the water cooler the project is stalemated because the two project leaders are angry at each other
918595 oh no i only found out by accident there were two people whispering a little too loud i put two and two together

918605 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
918606 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
918607 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
918608 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
918609 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
918610 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
918611 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
918612 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
918613 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
918614 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
918615 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
918616 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

918625 well be there in court with our good friend and client mike stebick
918626 mike has had a great career and this is a tough hit for him
918627 it was mikes winnebago he was basically the bus driver
918628 someone asked him to drive weve been told this woman was an illegal alien mike did not know that he had no other contact with her other than driving the winnebago
918629 stebicks planned guilty plea is not the end of this investigation
918630 this human trafficking investigation has been going on for some time and based on the information we have obtained so far its moving forward
918631 that must mean the message has not been downloaded from the server
918632 traditionally we know that children are breast fed anytime and anywhere according to the babys demand but nowadays some mothers are ashamed to breastfeed their babies in public
918633 this is feeding the baby on breast milk only no food drink or even water is necessary for a baby below the age of six months
918634 breast milk is easily digested and efficiently used by the babys body therefore the baby grows well
918635 it is in this view that we encourage all policymakers families communities to ensure that policies and the environment support the breastfeeding exclusively for six months and continue breastfeeding with feeding other appropriate complementary foods for up to two years and beyond

918656 previously all of our administrative information was managed using paper based processes that were labor intensive and prone to error
918657 we required a solution that would reduce the time and costs associated with the management of forms while also integrating easily with our existing system framework the liquidoffice solution provides us with out of the box robust capabilities that can be rapidly tailored and deployed by our staff with little to no programming with autonomy cardiff we will be able to automate and streamline our hr related business processes that have historically been paper based helping to decrease the time it takes to process our digital forms while increasing our employees productivity
918658 administrative processes within colleges and universities can be very complex and time consuming involving a significant number of staff members and processes in the approval process
918659 automating these types of processes where approvers may be geographically distributed across a large campus or regional environments is an area of strength for our business process automation solution we are pleased to help edmonds community college improve its employees productivity by eliminating manual data entry and providing immediate access to data and forms from within a unified online portal environment the solution will undoubtedly deliver process acceleration and hard cost savings immediately

918675 the presidency would like to place it on record that president mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
918676 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
918677 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
918678 the irregularities and improprieties referred to in our report point to the conduct of certain officials of the government departments involved and cannot in our view be attributed to the president or the ministers involved in their capacity as members of the ministers committee or cabinet
918679 the department would like to encourage mothers to get their children immunised against polio and measles in order to help build up their childs defences against the diseases
918680 immunisation has been demonstrated in research trials and efficacy measurements to be one of the most effective public health interventions available
918681 it is considered to be the cornerstone of public health care
918682 placing the rest at risk of being exposed to a preventable childhood disease
918683 very few children in this age category have received the additional dose according to the statistics collected from clinics
918684 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
918685 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
918686 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
918687 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
918688 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
918689 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
918690 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
918691 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
918692 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
918693 i said sure what can come of such a case
918694 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
918695 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
918696 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
918697 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
918698 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
918699 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
918700 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
918701 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
918702 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
918703 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
918704 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
918705 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
918706 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
918707 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
918708 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
918709 that facility could have taken care of me any day
918710 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
918711 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
918712 i left guatemala quiet in my heart immaculately clean but dilapidated guatemalas national hospital for orthopedics and rehabilitation operates on a shoestring budget of approximately 400 000 a year according to dr harold von ahn who was director when mr jim nez arrived
918713 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
918714 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
918715 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
918716 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
918717 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home in may 2004 a florida appeals court overruled judge fennelly
918718 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
918719 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
918720 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
918721 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
918722 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
918723 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
918724 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
918725 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
918726 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
918727 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
918728 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
918729 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
918730 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
918731 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
918732 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
918733 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
918734 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
918735 our economy is driven by tourism and use of the shore
918736 i think we would have a hard time getting public support for this concept
918737 we would certainly have some hesitation just based upon tourism and the natural beauty along the coast
918738 we certainly wouldnt want to do anything that would kill the goose that laid the golden egg
918739 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
918740 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
918741 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
918742 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
918743 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
918744 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
918745 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
918746 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
918747 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
918748 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
918749 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
918750 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
918751 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
918752 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
918753 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
918754 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
918755 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
918756 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
918757 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
918758 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
918759 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
918760 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
918761 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
918762 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
918763 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
918764 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
918765 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
918766 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
918767 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
918768 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
918769 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
918770 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
918771 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
918772 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
918773 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
918774 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
918775 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
918776 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
918777 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
918778 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
918779 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
918780 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
918781 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
918782 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
918783 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
918784 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
918785 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
918786 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
918787 the two rehearsals on 30 july and 2 august tested the plan and proved it to be effective we will improve it according to real situations
918788 the rush hours will be from 4pm to 8pm and after the ceremony

918790 previous analyses of routine hospital admission data from the us and italy have reported reductions in heart attacks following the introduction of smoking bans however our scottish study is the first to examine the impact of the legislation on smokers and non smokers separately we have been able to demonstrate that two thirds of the observed reduction in heart attack has occurred in non smokers and the results of the blood tests confirmed a reduction in exposure to second hand smoke among non smokers we believe that most of the reduction can be attributed to the introduction of the scottish smoking ban
918791 this evaluation of impact of smokefree legislation is the most comprehensive yet conducted and the findings have exceeded our greatest expectations
918792 the findings from the scottish study of heart attacks are of worldwide importance and the combined results from the evaluation provide a compelling case for other countries to implement a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places as soon as possible thereby reducing the harm caused by second hand smoke however it is essential that smokefree legislation is set within the context of wider tobacco control activity as outlined in the who framework convention on tobacco control an international treaty designed to reduce both the demand for and the supply of tobacco products 3
918793 this raft of research demonstrates the significant public health benefits that the smoking ban is already having in scotland it provides evidence that the legislation is improving the health of everyone in scotland including smokers non smokers children and barworkers one of the most important findings is the reduction in heart attacks we believe that the smoking ban was a large contributory factor to this drop and i am confident that we will continue to see the positive effects of the ban in years to come
918794 the basis of the viaderm device is transpharmas proprietary rf microchannel technology which is applied to create an array of microscopic pores in the outer skin surface facilitating the systemic delivery of drugs
918795 the pores are created rapidly with no pain or trauma to the skin the device can be applied to all skin types and is fully controlled by a unique feedback mechanism that ensures precise and reproducible drug delivery
918796 transpharma medical has constantly worked to spread its novel technology for transdermal drug delivery in therapeutic areas such as endocrine pain osteoporosis and diabetes
918797 its application can cover a wide range of therapeutic molecules like hpth hgh glp 1 analogues granisetron calcitonine testosterone diclofenac and more
918798 even today many health care plans laws and treatment strategies for life limiting conditions such as cancer and hiv aids do not allow adequate access to palliative care and pain management
918799 patients have physical symptoms and special psychosocial and spiritual needs which require appropriate care their family members and their caregivers also suffer the emotional and social consequences of the diseases and their treatments with adequate palliative care and pain treatment most patients and their families can be relieved from their suffering and the quality of their lives can be improved significantly we want to bring this to the attention of policy makers and funders with this declaration so that palliative care is included as a component of care in addition to prevention early detection and active treatment
918800 this is an unprecedented collective effort by representatives from healthcare and patient advocacy organisations from around the world working together to achieve seven specific goals in palliative care and pain management
918801 the declaration will be used by non governmental organisations professional organisations federations alliances and civic minded individuals to bring palliative care and pain treatment to the attention of policy makers regulators governments and organisations in order to improve the care of patients with life limiting conditions and to provide support to their families and loved ones

918803 the board was gravely concerned by the approach taken by the department of health in northern ireland with regard to the roll out of a national minor ailments scheme our colleagues in pcc have presented entirely reasonable proposals to the government with regard to the scheme that have been rejected without explanation it is not often that pharmacy bares its teeth but this situation requires a clear unequivocal position the pcc and uca have called upon this organisation to support the resolution already carried by their members the unanimous response of this board is to recommend that all npa members withdraw from the minor ailments scheme in northern ireland with immediate effect it is my sincere hope that this action will spur the department to return to the negotiating table so that patients and the public in the province can benefit from this service
918804 the npa and cmpmedica are partners in the pip code project that provides the data backbone to much of the electronic communication in pharmacy systems this board believes the benefit of having a single dataset for pharmacy electronic communications is an asset to be coveted in which pharmacy should invest we are aware that recent changes in the structure and pricing by cmpmedica have caused concern amongst npa members i have therefore asked the npa to work in partnership with cmpmedica to improve communication of the changes and benefits of this important project to npa members
918805 i would like to welcome our newest board member chris to his first board meeting in mallinson house we are always open to fresh thinking and new ideas and i am thankful for the contribution chris has made over the two days i have no doubt that the experience and insight that chris has as an independent contractor in a rural constituency will ensure we are inclusive of the concerns of npa members in a similar situation
918806 i was pleased to report to my fellow board members that a spirit of collaboration between the pharmacy bodies has underpinned the approach that will be taken with regard to the pharmacy white paper an approach that will benefit the profession generally and npa members specifically this approach has delivered another dividend we are now seeing a coming together of views on the electronic prescription service in england
918807 the npa remains broadly supportive of the proposals with regard to dispensing doctors contained within the pharmacy white paper the npa is clear that this issue is a matter that needs to be resolved between the representatives of dispensing doctors and the department of health the board awaits the consultation promised by the department with regard to 100 hour contracts appliance contractors and dispensing doctors where we will give the proposals on each our full consideration
918808 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
918809 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future

918818 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
918819 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
918820 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
918821 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
918822 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
918823 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
918824 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
918825 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
918826 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
918827 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

918830 yes you may be able to save some trout but there are subtle things that can go on that im not sure that fishermen think about
918831 if you look at pelican colonies around the west theyre kind of boom and bust
918832 these two colonies have had a lot of growth over the years but it was just a matter of time before they crashed
918833 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
918834 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
918835 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river
918836 its not the ideal time to stock rainbow trout but its the only time to stock them and survive
918837 these birds and these fish evolved together but theyre in a somewhat altered ecosystem
918838 whatever happens well have to weigh all the competing interests
918839 with this new contrast medium we were able to visualize five to ten times more foci of inflammation in comparison to conventional mri images and contrast media
918840 ms is the most frequent cause of occupational disability and handicap in young adults

918844 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
918845 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
918846 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
918847 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
918848 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
918849 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
918850 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
918851 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
918852 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
918853 topical interferon alfa 2 b and aggressive surgical excision can both be considered effective treatments for ossn
918854 topical interferon or surgical excision for the management of primary ocular surface squamous neoplasia
918855 this protective effect suggests that a public health measure aimed at preventing development of myopia could be based on increasing the engagement of children in outdoor activity
918856 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
918857 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies

918860 tnfaip3 can be thought of as a critical brake mechanism for the immune system
918861 when the gene doesnt function properly the immune system redlines
918862 we suspect that the variant either doesnt make enough of the protein or it makes a less effective protein
918863 our data adds tnfaip3 to a growing list of lupus associated genes that may help us diagnose and treat our patients
918864 every single lupus associated gene we discover is just as important as the others
918865 each gene can set off new opportunities and new projects for us you never know which gene is going to give you the best chance to develop new therapeutics or better diagnostics
918866 we also want to know exactly what effect the gene variation has on a20 protein production and function
918867 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
918868 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
918869 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
918870 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
918871 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
918872 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present

918876 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
918877 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
918878 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
918879 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate

918884 one ongoing concern remains harpers determination to end the canadian wheat board monopoly on the marketing of western barley crops a recent federal court ruling upheld the wheat boards right to serve as a single marketing desk for canadian barley
918885 but that does not change the determination of the government of canada to see a dual market for canadian farmers
918886 i hope the wheat board will start working with the government to make sure this is gonna happen cause its gonna happen one way or another whether it takes a little bit of time or a lot of time its gonna happen
918887 the harper government is tinkering with the rules governing the election of canadian wheat board directors in an attempt to influence this falls scheduled vote critics charge
918888 they think they can marshal lots of corporate money and lots of big spender money and try to destroy the board by advertising against it

918901 mmoja wa makamu wa rais atakuwa mtu ambaye kwa kawaida makaazi yake yatakuwa zanzibar na makamu wa rais huyo kuwa msaidizi mkuu wa rais wa jamhuri ya muungano katika kutekeleza majukumu yake ya uongozi kwa upande wa zanzibar na kwa hadhi ya rais wa zanzibar atakuwa kinara wa uongozi wa zanzibar

918908 hello fellow stampers my name is robin and i love to stamp i have been stamping for about 8 9 years when kerin asked me to do this i thought sure no problem i have to tell you it was quite the challenge the problem is i love every stampin up set and embellishment i have bought over the many years and i use every single one retired or not i like to mix them up and use different sets together my challenge was in only using the products currently in the catalog i have never had to pull the reins in and although challenging it was really quite fun i cant say i have a favorite technique because i keep learning new things and i love them all happy stamping
918909 intensified action to move towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support
918910 although we have seen real progress in the last two years if we want to continue to see results we will need to see more financial resources and commitment
918911 are still five new infections for every two people who are newly added on treatment
918912 time to ramp up funding from all sources not to slow down or go on to other things
918913 were on the path toward victory here lets invest more
918914 not sure we will ever get to a point where we can say hiv aids is not a public health problem
918915 there are now nearly 1 5 million kenyans living with the virus this is nothing less than a national crisis
918916 the only way to reverse this epidemic is through prevention
918917 we have made notable progress however hiv aids rates among our families and communities remains unacceptably high and the impact severe
918918 the point i will make at the conference is that those statutes apart from their very broad and vague wording are very bad for the central issue of the epidemic which is getting treatment to people
918919 african health care systems were not ok before the aids epidemic and have become better after the opening of clinics
918920 fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely
918921 individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
918922 viewed as an interim step its funding and expansion make sense not only morally but also as a practical matter of economics and foreign policy
918923 b ut only if a massive commitment to finding searches for both a vaccine and cure for hiv are sustained for years to come
918924 ought to be eliminated entirely from the pantheon of threats to humanity

918926 even my staff encounter problems with them we have the endorsement of the narcotics authorities and we give needles not drugs
918927 so if they catch our clients with drugs we cant stop them but you cant catch those with just needles
918928 we have our outreach workers getting arrested they authorities raid and catch everyone we are forever trying to bail out our outreach workers from the lockup which is a major headache on a day to day basis
918929 infections are going up but surveillance is very poor in malaysia
918930 many young msm only know of their illness for the first time when they are warded with aids how long have they been positive how long have they been infectious it is critical

918940 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
918941 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
918942 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
918943 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
918944 resistance of human glioblastoma multiforme cells to growth factor inhibitors is overcome by blockade of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
918945 hepatic cb1 receptor is required for development of diet induced steatosis altered lipid profile and insulin and leptin resistance in mice
918946 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
918947 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
918948 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
918949 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
918950 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
918951 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
918952 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
918953 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
918954 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
918955 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
918956 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists

918958 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
918959 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
918960 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
918961 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
918962 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
918963 high infection rates are in particular observed related to implants catheters and stents
918964 those for urinary catheters mounting up to 30 per week
918965 one particularly attractive approach is the application of antibiotics directly on the material
918966 we were able to demonstrate that our hybrid firmly attaches to titanium dioxide surfaces and effectively hinders infection with bacillus subtilis as well as the attachment of cellular material
918967 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
918968 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
918969 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive
918970 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
918971 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments
918972 little could darwin have known that his origin of the species would one day explain the origin of the tumor
918973 this research report completely changes our understanding of the many gene mutations that cause cancer
918974 this shows that giving people with learning disabilities the right to have sex and relationships is really important for professionals this information should help those working at a strategic level support people with learning disabilities have an independent life
918975 living independently means more than getting qualifications and securing a job expressing your sexuality and enjoying a relationship is something everyone values but poor sex education and fears about exploitation can stand in the way of this happening for people with learning disabilities
918976 information and skills must be available to people with learning disabilities so they can enjoy intimate relationships without putting themselves at risk and fpa would like to see more recognition of the importance of sex and relationships in their lives
918977 we must work together to help provide people with learning disabilities with the information education and opportunity to have sex and relationships
918978 a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
918979 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
918980 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
918981 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
918982 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
918983 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
918984 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
918985 no we came here for the food in all its bizarre exotic glory take your pick scorpion kebab roast dog leg deep fried worm and for the absolutely fearless what about the ham sandwich on offer at the olympic media centre
918986 dog may have been banned from menus at beijings olympic games but brits can still scoff a stomach churning array of food including seal penis olympic chiefs will not be serving dishes containing mans best friend at official olympic restaurants in a bid to make visitors feel comfortable but they will offer a menu worthy of im a celebrity get me out of here including deep fried scorpions and sea urchins cow stomach turtle and brains in a hot pot

918994 its one of those mountains where once youve climbed it you dont ever go back
918995 for every step you go up it tries to bring you down
918996 without this we dont have a chance to get the federal money nor should we get it
918997 fortunately we dont have a lot of these claims at least of this scope
918998 it was very disappointing to see how quickly the case was shut down and that once again big money and big business prevailed
918999 shes had a really good life though much better than she would have had
919000 you look to see how wide they are and make sure they arent stiff legged you want clear eyes
919001 they have tons of personality when she wants to play she gets all jumpy
919002 you understand itll go all along its in the back of your mind but its still hard
919003 but if you buy from here you know its healthy you know theyve been treated well
919004 obviously i am upset and worried for my familys safety in the future
919005 once we rebuild our house and move back in i dont know what more we can do
919006 i dont think the university can do too much to prevent these kind of attacks i would like to see the citizens of santa cruz and our elected officials including the mayor step up and condemn this kind of violence
919007 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
919008 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
919009 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
919010 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
919011 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
919012 i question a lot about whether these people really care as much about the cause as they do about bringing notoriety to themselves
919013 we understand their frustration we understand why they are doing that sort of thing
919014 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
919015 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
919016 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
919017 this is not the life i ordered 50 ways to keep your head above water when life keeps dragging you down
919018 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
919019 it is doubtful that any one single event no matter how global iconic and well executed can succeed in healing such deep historical wounds
919020 the games are very short but what is left behind will last
919021 im too old to come to this institution and sit on my hands for 15 years before i make a peep
919022 thats not my personality thats not my style and thats not why i was elected by the people in my district
919023 ill make waves when i think thats necessary but im also a team player
919024 my life experiences have helped me to be less fearful
919025 in politics that has allowed me to take on issues sooner rather than later
919026 i had no idea a new member was supposed to say thank you very much and sit down i saw it as an opportunity to make a substantive speech
919027 three chairmen in the last two weeks have told me youre new
919028 and i dont think the american people will tolerate another bailout of a bear stearns
919029 this is something that can be done right now and have an impact
919030 we have to make the bureaucracy the government work better
919031 this is not the life i ordered 50 ways to keep your head above water when life keeps dragging you down
919032 it was obvious that his call was not work related as he was having a jolly good time laughing
919033 wanted our officers to set a good example for others to follow
919034 it would be difficult for us to enforce a law if we violate it
919035 after the law went into effect i overheard some officers saying yeah but were exempt
919036 we made sure that they realized that the only exemption was for emergency business and nevertheless it set a negative image having officers on a cell phone when the public is prohibited
919037 their first reactions were thats not fair and why is it ok for police and not the rest of us
919038 can i take down their car number and report them
919039 there are a million and one reasons why officers need cell phones
919040 without them they would have to go into the station over and over again thereby taking them off the street
919041 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission mr bartlett said
919042 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
919043 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
919044 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
919045 while this incident happened outside of school grounds the school will be investigating with a view to taking action
919046 such incidents whether in or out of school are taken very seriously and are not tolerated in any form
919047 the girls were extremely lucky that no train came otherwise it would have been a double tragedy
919048 it is clear that there was no security at the railway station to stop the brutal assault
919049 an urgent review of security at train stations is urgently needed to prevent a repeat attack
919050 that security was never provided in the liberals nine years in government and isnt even provided anywhere else that we know of

919072 he steve noticed the slightest traces of mortar adhering to pieces of flint in a field near st peters pit and michael and i followed up this sighting with a radar survey of the field
919073 the results were spectacular not only did they locate the building but the radar showed that it survived in very good condition and was quite large not a simple cell or room but something that resembled a small church
919074 it was probably built in the early 12th century and underwent a number of changes in ground plan
919075 one particularly exciting find is a large section of the south wall of the church which collapsed inwards probably when the building was being dismantled for building materials in the 16th century
919076 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperatures and other weather conditions from these records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
919077 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
919078 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted
919079 neither does the 123 agreement with the us provide any such fuel supply guarantee nor can the iaea ensure uninterrupted fuel supply since it is a monitoring agency
919080 thus the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
919081 therefore the safeguards agreement can only be terminated under the standard termination conditions contained in articles 29 and 32 of the agreement implying that nuclear facilities can be withdrawn from safeguards only after these facilities are no longer usable for any nuclear activity
919082 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the indian agreement is of indefinite duration
919083 there are no conditions for the discontinuation of safeguards other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same as for other 66 type agreements
919084 we condemn the indefinite curfew and the shoot at sight orders on peaceful protesters in jammu and its outskirts governor n n vohra along with his people is trying to crush the entire movement initiated by the common citizens of jammu against the communal and discriminatory policies of the state government
919085 it is a direct attack on the freedom of press and a human rights violation by the state the national human rights commission nhrc needs to intervene immediately
919086 we immediately demand re allocation of land to the amarnath shrine board and removal of governor vohra
919087 seek peoples mandate instead of bowing to sonia gandhi and lalu yadav
919088 shibu soren should not bow his head to congress president sonia gandhi and rjd rashtriya janata dal chief lalu yadav to become chief minister of the state
919089 if shibu soren wants to become chief minister then he should seek peoples mandate
919090 soren is camping in new delhi to meet sonia gandhi for last three days soren rarely gets to meet sonia he is indulging in political tantrums

919142 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
919143 wpp announces that the offer document containing the formal offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of tns is being posted
919144 gfk is continuing to actively pursue an all cash offer for tns and discussions in relation to this possible offer are progressing positively
919145 gfk therefore urges tns shareholders to take no action in relation to wpps offer for tns at this time
919146 no assurance can be given that an offer will be made
919147 wispa is a true icon loved by its fans everywhere we brought it back temporarily to see if the desire was genuine but fans are still rallying so we took the decision to bring it back for good

919150 ive been working with taxonomies for a long time and it seems no one really recognized the issue of multiple taxonomies except as a problem but since it is the backbone of our system we actually had to manage that

919160 most of them just walked past with their ears plugged into their music they didnt seem to have much time for us even though some fans were waving flags and cheering
919161 from their faces they must have been thinking aiyoh what lah coming to this sakai savages a derogatory term for the orang asli country at least stop and admire the dances for a little while lah
919162 while local reporters were playing cat and mouse games to get to any one of the superstars during their two day stay foreign news agencies and british newspapers had loads of stories quoting the superstars a case of double standards perhaps
919163 at the official training session on monday thousands of fans thronged the shah alam stadium to catch a glimpse of their aces in action and hopefully get an autograph or snap a picture for posterity
919164 while a select few probably with connections to the organisers or someone higher up managed to get onto the pitch for their autographs and snapshots many of the die hard fans could only watch from the stands anger seething and tempers flaring
919165 hopefully when other bigger teams come our way local media will not have crumbs thrown their way and the fans will be given their moneys worth

919167 on the one hand you try and save the forest on the other you give incentives for its conversion
919168 land use change in the amazon is first and foremost a product of ranching it is on the hooves of cattle out on the forest fringe where the repercussions are being felt
919169 signals that the world cares about the global value of forests and is ready to pay for it there is now a value to conserving not just harvesting the forest
919170 while governments insist they are doing their utmost to stop deforestation they have been putting in place incentives for the destruction of the forest it is taxpayers money fuelling this

919178 for me the most important thing is to keep on playing my football and enjoying myself no matter what you are no matter what you have done some of the fans will love you and some of the fans will hate you
919179 but i hope im in a good situation most of the fans love me and thats the most important thing
919180 for me what happened in the summer is already behind me and now its up to me to play my game and score some goals
919181 football fans are like that you show them that you are happy and that you have the desire to want to play for your team
919182 i will try to do that all this year since the beginning of the discussions i always told the boss of my desire to stay with the club
919183 when you net 30 goals in a season a lot of clubs come to look for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world

919195 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
919196 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
919197 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
919198 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil

919202 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
919203 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
919204 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

919222 the short answer is nobody knows suffice it to say that ten years ago when the oil price was 10 nobody foresaw that it would be 140 today so even if i had any particular insight there would still be a 50 50 chance of getting it wrong that also explains why we have stopped to make a lot of forecasts
919223 we look at fundamentals as well as small shifts we always ask whats going on in the middle east how many refineries are online is there enough gasoline in the stations
919224 so beyond the fundamentals the price of oil is determined by psychologies tensions in the world or lack of spare capacity
919225 i think that easy oil and easy gas that is fuels that are relatively cheap to produce and very easy to get to the market will peak somewhere in the coming ten years
919226 you have to invest a lot per unit per lot per barrel ten years ago when the oil price was 10 nobody foresaw that it would be 140 today of oil and it is not just the dollars per barrel but the brain cells per barrel that go up as well that changes the nature of the industry completely it becomes very technology intensive capital intensive top expert intensive
919227 we have hired thousands and thousands of experts mid career which we have never done in the past this is a clear indication we are sure there is an opportunity for those unconventional energy sources
919228 if we can only do the same as national companies in producing easy the industry has become very technology intensive capital intensive and top expert intensive oil then the value proposition we can make to those governments who have a very strong agenda will be quite difficult so for us it is very important that we have something distinctive such as unique technologies large project management operational excellences track records of working cheaper or having access to markets
919229 if we bring something to the table that others dont have the national oil companies will probably invite us to form joint ventures as they have done in the past if we dont they wont
919230 one of the key things about planning the future of the energy system is to recognize the natural timeframes if you get a car today that is of high quality you know that it is still going to be on the road in 20 years somewhere in the world
919231 and if you build a power plant it is going to be operating in 40 years so if there are any brand new technologies they need to be out of the lab now to be of significant scale in the time period that were talking about
919232 the world faces a rise in emissions by 25 between now and 2020 because of the surge in energy
919233 however we believe that if the world makes the right choices in the next few years we could bring down energy related emissions substantially after 2020 widespread deployment of co2 capture and storage ccs at power stations is crucial for that to happen
919234 we put quite a co2 penalty on every design we make why because many of our installations are built for decades and if you put a high co2 penalty on every total co2 you emit you will have higher efficiency units
919235 our aim is make transport fuels out of next generation bio fuels that is the sustainable non food variety to that end we are on the move all the time by collaborating with small companies and by doing our own research
919236 i think that the way that we look at next generation biofuels is that you have to look at an integrated way how sustainable are the biofuels what is the co2 footprint will you eat up your own biofuels that is very much part of our thinking
919237 we have already learned from hard lessons in developing renewables but we are very committed to developing renewables and to making them cheaper
919238 the thing you have to do is to go through the learning curves as fast as you can that has to do with reserves demonstrations projects and brains
919239 only if you have a value proposition for the consumers which is attractive then you can invest a lot and that we have already learned from hard lessons in developing renewables we have been too early in technologies that people didnt like to buy but we are very committed to developing renewables and to making them cheaper
919240 how sustainable are the biofuels what is the co2 footprint will you eat up your own biofuels that is very much part of our thinking
919241 you essentially have to recreate three industries construction uranium mining and waste management that have effectively been depleted over the last 20 years so it takes time to rebuild the industry and then have the scope that grows we see it growing but we dont see it able to be the silver bullet
919242 i worked in the united states in the 1990s and i picked up this idea here i was quite enthusiastic about it we are still enthusiastic but it will be less and later everybody in the field still has to work out a lot of problems while it is still a quite exciting fuel you have to still figure out from what you can make the hydrogen so we think that there is a future and it may compete with all kinds of alternative forms of transport but it will not be there tomorrow

919260 the murder rate in states that had the death penalty was 46 percent higher in 2005 than in states without it he also said that while the murder rate has been on the decline since 1990 it has fallen by 56 percent in states without the death penalty compared to a 38 percent drop in states that have capital punishment

919275 for many people being trapped indefinitely in a small space close to dozens perhaps hundreds of cranky strangers without adequate food water and toilet facilities is the definition of hell
919276 jetblue airways the popular carrier that went through a management meltdown last week stranding hundreds of passengers for six hours or more on the tarmac at john f kennedy international airport now says it will pay penalties for such delays according to the length of the wait after five hours on the tarmac passengers would be returned to the terminal and given free round trip tickets of equal value to their missed flight
919277 a good case might be made that an hour or two should be enough for airline personnel to determine when a flight is likely to be cleared for takeoff and to give passengers the option of waiting it out in the plane or returning to the terminal
919278 air travelers have often indicated that cost and convenience rank higher in their concerns than comfort and airlines arent exactly running a huge profit margin even so a minimum level of customer service is not too much to expect

919285 a communication expert has said that mr brown fails to get his message over to voters because he consistently looks angry or sad
919286 speaking after analysing videos of mr brown discussing a range of topics james mcbrien of clearwater a london consultancy said the prime minister risks alienating more voters unless he appears more optimistic
919287 my advice would be to relax and allow yourself to smile a bit more especially when talking about upbeat news people warm to friendliness and are less attracted to fearful glum or angry characters

919353 christian perspective informed by a social gospel or christian socialist tradition should not be rejected contemptuously by secular politicians as if these views are an unwelcome intrusion into the political sphere if the churches are barred from participating in the great debates about the values that ultimately underpin our society our economy and our polity then we have reached a very strange place indeed
919354 some say there is no place for faith in the 21st century i say they are wrong some say that faith is the enemy of reason i say also they are wrong it was the church that began first schools for the poor it was the church that began first hospitals for the poor it was the church that began first refuges for the poor and these great traditions continue for the future and i say this that christianity has been an overwhelming force for good in the world

919357 chicken little arguments are no substitute for getting right the important details on issues of far reaching consequence for example claims from some quarters that the great barrier reef would be destroyed if australia which emits less than 2 of global greenhouse gases does not adopt an ets emissions trading scheme are patent nonsense
919358 if australia moves ahead of the rest of the world to curb carbon emissions there will be no benefit to australia or the world but a potentially very high cost to us

919405 our advertisement on television and the internet is very very good except for local television
919406 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
919407 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because it is not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 percent stake

919419 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
919420 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
919421 helping families under pressure especially those under economic pressure to commit and stay committed is one of the most effective anti poverty pro opportunity pro equality steps one could take
919422 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
919423 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
919424 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
919425 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
919426 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
919427 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
919428 i think that we need to do much more to ensure that fathers play their full part in the lives of their children
919429 cultural signals and social norms do influence behaviour and the costs of relationship breakdown of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
919430 alongside a new emphasis on making sure the small minority of fathers who dont live up to their responsibilities are properly challenged there must also be greater support to help the overwhelming majority of men who are doing a brilliant job for their children
919431 its important that we see parenting as a shared responsibility with fathers playing an equal and complementary role to mothers those societies which help fathers play their full and equal role enjoy greater family stability as a result
919432 it is important also that we ensure fathers play the fullest possible role in those circumstances where relationships do break up

919465 georgia is beginning to apply armed pressure to us so that we would agree to wreck the format without the participation of north ossetia and russia but we are not the kind of people who could do that
919466 without the participation of north ossetia and russia we wont agree to anything with anybody
919467 today the georgian side is trying to discredit our position before the whole world by stating that they are prepared for direct negotiations with south ossetia that is nothing more than their latest pr action on the one hand while talking about negotiations we observe that serious weapons have been drawn up along the border of the republic of south ossetia including artillery rocket launchers
919468 we started the rally off really well and it was good to be on the podium after the first day

919470 but we lost the feeling on day 2 and had to settle for fifth position which isnt too bad and at least its some more points moving me up to seventh in the championship we got new expert race suits for this rally so we may not have been the fastest crew but we were definitely the best looking
919471 alexander solzhenitsyn was a man of immense personal courage and as a writer the one indisputable heir of tolstoy
919472 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
919473 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
919474 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter

919609 i am not from uganda and i dont know many of the words to his songs but i absolutely love him
919610 he is a good performer but the sound quality in here is terrible
919611 the boston concert was sold out despite being held in a hall three times this size
919612 in the future hopefully we will have african concerts in nicer places downtown
919613 i dont mean to sound clich but donations from events like this are about how a little bit can go a long way if put it in the right hands
919614 we hope to share our experience and learn more about the culture
919615 there was no curriculum and the children had no pencils
919616 in 1999 we found bare classroom walls but now those walls have colorful wall hangings and the shelves are stocked with books
919617 you pinch off a bit of the bread and scoop up the meat or chicken stew or vegetables or lentils with the spongy side
919618 i dream of an africa that will be peaceful i dream of an africa that will be stable politically socially and economically
919619 my ultimate goal is to go back home and spread peace and understanding
919620 i heard about this event from my uncle who encouraged me to participate
919621 minnesota is definitely drawing african immigrants in large numbers no doubt about it
919622 if you include children born here it may have doubled already in this decade the share of all minnesota births that are to somali mothers is becoming incredible
919623 they all want to move here if they can but its hard to move across borders information moves much faster they have cousins here they may even visit here but they can only stay for a limited time
919624 a visitor at first i came to explore perhaps to go to school
919625 but we are grateful to america some day we will welcome them to somalia as they have welcomed us here
919626 i really need a vacation but i dont think that will be possible because already there are so many inquiries about being included in next years plans
919627 they did a good job putting it together for the first time
919628 i am encouraged that since i cant be at the africa world festival in detroit i can attend this one
919629 this is a taste of whats in store for you for the rest of the weekend

919632 i am blessed to be doing what i love most
919633 back home people dont get to see musicians up close and personal
919634 we only see them on the television it is my goal to get musicians to go back home and have a big concert
919635 you are coming to a show of how rhythms come together through the element of the bomba drum
919636 if you look on the bright side next year cant get any worse than this
919637 global businesses continue to suffer from a seemingly unbridgeable divide between their marketing and sales teams a gap that undermines the efforts of the crucial corporate functions necessary to generate demand capture revenue and gain competitive advantage
919638 theres a critical need educate management about where and how marketing should be powering both the go to market process and every step of the lead generation qualification closing and account reactivation cycle
919639 we all understand and accept that the customer must be at the center of any organisational relationship however neither sales nor marketing is effectively leveraging customer data and insight to form deeper more connected relationships with the customer
919640 cest le propre dun esprit volu que de pouvoir admettre une opinion sans lapprouver
919641 wir ben tigen einen u turn bei der inhaltlichen ausrichtung des landesjugendreferats
919642 im feeling great the more i throw the better i feel
919643 hes a big strong boy and were going down the stretch now
919644 i knew we were off so i decided to get in a little extra work
919645 i took a deep breath when ludwick came up because i know hes hot but those are absolutely the situations i want to be in
919646 didier spiller ikke med i vores f r ste kamp mod portsmouth og han misser formentlig ogs den anden kamp mod wigan hvis der ikke er problemer med kn et b r han kunne spille med efter de kampe
919647 it was a crazy ballgame but it was a big win
919648 defense is an asset to this club and we just didnt get it done today it was a poor game
919649 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
919650 although i was hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
919651 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
919652 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in

919657 we are delighted to have reached agreement with the ebrc on ways in which we can work together to ensure the long term conservation of our wild birds which are crucial indicators for the health of the countrys environment and wildlife
919658 the agency has a policy of building effective partnerships with all those bodies that share its vision for the conservation and protection of the uaes environment and wildlife
919659 the ebrc and its members and contributors have worked over many years to collect and maintain this important database which will provide us with valuable information to assess the changing patterns of wild bird populations throughout the country
919660 the unites arab emirates represents a major stopover site for migrating and wintering waders with several million shorebirds occuring during migration
919661 birds conservation has always been based on voluntary efforts and contributions from bird lovers and enthusiasts and represents a major pillar of birdlife internationals work
919662 this news will form an important step towards the establishment of a national monitoring scheme that is hoped to be updated regularly it will help build local capacity through mobilizing interested people to contribute their records
919663 birds conservation has always been based on voluntary efforts and contributions from bird lovers and enthusiasts and represents a major pillar of birdlife internationals work
919664 i think this is a great example of how amateur and leisure birders can contribute their observations to be used scientifically to aid conservation in a rapidly developing country this is especially important in the uae which is very proud of its abundant birdlife the records will now be kept safe for future generations to use
919665 we have wanted for many years to have our database housed effectively for the long term by an appropriate government agency ead is the ideal partner for the ebrc and i am delighted that we have now been able to conclude this agreement
919666 hes a special horse i dont care what anybody says
919667 i saw a dimension of big brown today that i just didnt know existed
919668 he showed more than just his ability he showed his heart thats the sign of a great race horse
919669 the plan was to go to the lead but that would have been suicidal
919670 that guy on the outside was making the lead no matter what
919671 if big brown was a human being id want to go clubbing with him
919672 curlin couldnt win this race we could curlin got beat by a filly we havent our horse is undefeated on the grass curlin isnt i dont know why people think curlin is such a good horse were way better than curlin
919673 its like wearing a visor except a visor gets wet and fogged up and everything
919674 its a little bit of a red tinge its just like wearing sunglasses its not a huge change it brings out the red and the green takes away the blue
919675 we still may hold a few guys out in different practices as we go along were getting worn down a little bit
919676 right now we need to get the fluid out of his knee and get that thing settled down a little bit
919677 he threw strikes was very aggressive going after hitters and looked very poised and under control to me
919678 but whether or not well call him up is something we cant discuss publicly we would need a reason to bring him but there is no question he has major league stuff
919679 carrasco has had major league stuff since he was 19 but well evaluate him like we would any pitcher well need him to be more consistent in the strike zone like he was tonight we want him to grow more mature more i like the maturity hes shown tonight i think carrasco will create his own timetable to get to the majors hell let us know when hes ready and when his time will come were willing to be patient and see if he can get major league hitters out consistently
919680 this is the best and healthiest ive been this year
919681 this is definitely the hardest i threw this season i havent thrown 96 until today i feel more mature i want to stay here and get more experience i want to do my job
919682 i just saw ruben outside the clubhouse after the game
919683 but i was having a little tenderness in my right shoulder about 3 weeks ago it bothered the way i threw but i felt great tonight its the best velocity i had this season
919684 whether thats in september or not well see but were pretty pleased with our starters now so i dont know where hell fit
919685 but he showed me tonight three major league pitches with an occasional slider and was consistent with them all
919686 i just think they are more exciting this is one of the longest lap times about 55 seconds that we have besides a road course and certainly the longest race we have
919687 to go 500 miles under this lap time is a long long day and it gets pretty spread out i just think we could put on a little more exciting race with a 400 mile race
919688 we need to put on the best show possible for the fans this track is so big we get a separation of cars around the 2 5 mile track
919689 we need to find a way to compress some action so it might be better racing if the fans like it the mattiolis will like it
919690 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
919691 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
919692 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
919693 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
919694 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
919695 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
919696 if the opportunity comes again i feel like it would be a definite id think about it wie told the
919697 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
919698 i think weve got a lot of speed out there and a lot of size with that speed
919699 you dont really know until the first game ive always said special teams 20 percent of it is doing the scheme and 80 percent is just the will
919700 hes more of an open field type using his space same thing with what makes him an effective wide receiver same reason why he doesnt play running back
919701 hes not a point of attack guy where youre going to just try and ram him up inside hes a guy that youre going to utilize the field and try to spread him out some again he brings something to the table in terms of kick return as well but right now we feel really good with what bookers got
919702 hes a guy that has great speed great speed and great vision very similar to the running back position he knows where the reads are on returns he knows where to break off of those reads
919703 one thing that we were questioning there was whether or not he would be able to break the tackles and hes shown out here during the live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles running from scrimmage its obviously a little bit different on the kick return aspect of it youve got guys flying around coming downhill at him but we feel like he could definitely get the job done here
919704 please believe before we go down to pittsburgh for fridays preseason opener i will be having a conversation or two with my guy
919705 hes one of my best friends anyway but the guy is as good at kick returns as anybody
919706 more guys will have an opportunity to hit you on kick return as opposed to punt
919707 you can make one guy miss and be off to the races on a punt return i think it takes a certain toughness to be a kick returner
919708 the biggest thing i see people are coming down on kickoffs full speed you got to see a hole to envision a return
919709 punt returns you basically wait for the ball to come down and once you get it in your hands you can do a little more movement back there punt return is more open kickoffs you have to hit it and go
919710 the second one i really rolled into it and protected it
919711 id actually never seen them doing that before i thought ahhh something an old guy can do too without getting injured it was kinda fun you know to catch passes would be more fun but to catch donovans ball i think the golf game would be destroyed
919712 hes a good athlete hes got a little bit of a sore ankle but hes played through that and hes done very well with it it hurts him a little bit when hes being bull rushed because he cant put his foot in the ground like he wants to hes moving around very well hes got very long arms and knows how to use them hes not afraid to play the game out in front of him ive been impressed by the way hes handled himself
919713 carl asked what would you do if the track would get cleaned up and wed run the race green i told him we would come in for two tires
919714 i felt you left it up to me when jimmie committed to pitting i thought well go ahead and pit
919715 we were trying to blame one another for the idea of pitting
919716 i had to leave the pit box because i was worried that bob would punch me in the neck but we have a good relationship we can be completely honest with one another
919717 then we get back together and calmer heads prevail we come to terms with what we want to do and 99 percent of the time it works out for us
919718 finally running with the guys up front is a great feeling
919719 if i do it once theyll just expect me to do it again
919720 they had told me they were thinking about giving me a day off so you have to be ready you know youre going to fit in somewhere
919721 ive just got to keep going out there and hoping the team gets a win when i pitch
919722 that teams good man all of them are good hitters if you make a mistake theyll hit it
919723 they were just swinging and i appreciate that it made my job easier
919724 i feel like hes showed us two real good performances in a row now
919725 i knew when i put him in hed come back around to hit
919726 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
919727 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
919728 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
919729 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
919730 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
919731 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
919732 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
919733 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
919734 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
919735 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
919736 we are making every effort to make sure that gilad shalit returns home as soon as possible we know gilad is alive we know where he is held and by whom
919737 i hope we succeed in bringing this affair to an end
919738 the boycott will find expression in joint actions of civil society including all ngos labour unions and political formations but all actions will be lawful because we dont want chaos we dont want inflation and we dont want disorder
919739 the state had formed a special committee of deputy ministers to monitor what is happening in kremikovtzi
919740 now he knows what he has and where hes going to be
919741 he knows its time to get in the gym 100 percent working hard
919742 this is where he wanted to be we went through the business aspects to see what his value and level of interest around the nba might be but he wanted to stay with the sixers and they were very fair with him hes a very very mature minded 21 year old in his thinking
919743 i usually dont look for anything i usually try and react
919744 he threw a couple fastballs a couple change ups he left the fastball over the plate and i got the barrel to it
919745 ive been there china before and had a great time i thought it was really an amazing composition of old and new youd seen a high rise and passing in front of the high rise was an older guy on a bicycle with so many things piled up on the back im curious to see whats happened since ive been there 3 years ago
919746 from everything from the opening ceremonies to trading pins with athletes its different
919747 i was a big pin trader in my time the sense of togetherness with your teammates is awesome
919748 i feel very lucky but i know how much hard work ive put in to get here
919749 ive always wanted to play in the olympics ive scratched and clawed for this moment and now that its here i really want to take advantage and show the world what i can do
919750 i had my parents and my boyfriend come to last years world cup but this is a big time event for me and it makes it a lot easier when there are no distractions one less thing to worry about
919751 its all good though they know i love them and i know theyll be rooting me on
919752 james helped me get to the next level he made me his project and really worked on strengthening not just my physical and technical game but he worked on me mentally
919753 i always had a dream of playing on this u s team and when i heard the doubts of others james was the one that pushed me and made me realize that i could do it hes one person i dont want to let down
919754 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
919755 i put in a lot of work off the court to be able to win these sorts of tournaments and it makes it all worthwhile
919756 lebanons march 14th movement cast itself into an abyss of moral depravity that the blocs supporters myself included never thought possible
919757 possibly seniora and jumblatt believe kuntars account that the hostages were killed by friendly fire from israeli forces during the rescue attempt and that the israeli security forces lied about the events for propaganda purposes
919758 this guy right here is the son of a bitch who did x y and z and hes going to be held to account for it
919759 lebanons march 14th movement cast itself into an abyss of moral depravity that the blocs supporters myself included never thought possible
919760 according to the israeli ministry of foreign affairs kuntar had initially admitted to bludgeoning einat to death after being captured

919766 im glad to see maliki showing some backbone stopping bushs attempt to own iraq for the foreseeable future bad bad move but then again going into iraq was a bad bad move but his power isnt very good right now

919773 as the pentagon withdrew five army brigades sent as reinforcements in 2007 the remaining troops could be used as peacekeepers more than combatants

919778 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919779 he will be more than happy to talk to you
919780 i came to work for an israeli businessman he has a big company that he wanted me to work for after a year we thought there was a good potential in the food business so i contacted a friend in israel he is one of my partners and we started with a small coffee place with two local partners but we didnt get a long too well so we went our separate ways and we sold our part the next thing we got another local partner and another partner from holland who is a silent investor and the four of us established this company and now we have this bistro and now we have the bakery and another sandwich bar in the eu building this concept is very similar to what we have back home that is why we did it this looks very similar to places in tel aviv
919781 i notice that a lot of places in prishtina remind me of tel aviv
919782 people like it they come to speak to us they want to be in contact here i didnt see anybody that was negative on the contrary the people are very warm very nice they take islam to a beautiful place not a violent place when they hear i am from israel they react very warmly
919783 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
919784 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
919785 the conflict is not our problem we are muslims but not really we have respect for israelis because of the u s i have good friends from there
919786 albanians everywhere are aware that jews want to help them in this conflict
919787 and jews are aware and thankful to albanians for saving their lives during the second world war so we have our sympathy for israel i dont think the muslims here are on the side of the palestinians
919788 in albania and kosovo we are in support of israel i would never side with the muslim side to wipe israel off the face of the world 90 of kosovo feels this way the reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us we were muslims even in the second world war stronger muslims than we are now but even then we protected them with our lives our grandfathers protected the jews wherever they were in the region
919789 they tell me that in the holocaust they used to keep the survivors inside of shelters
919790 and vice versa in 1999 the first plane that landed in prishtina for support was an israeli plane
919791 the plane was medical support and doctors and some security and they took refugees to israel i know some albanians who live to this day in israel
919792 they took them most of them came back here i have talked to more than five people already that lived between 1999 and 2001 in israel until everything was quiet here then they came back
919793 it is like when israel went to india when they had an earthquake
919794 they went to africa when there was a disaster in mombasa this is what israel does
919795 actually after the tsunami they wanted to send it to indonesia and they didnt let them because it was a muslim country but israel and kosovo have a very good relationship the prime minister visited israel a few months ago
919796 i think that a lot of people in the world think that the war in israel is a religious war
919797 i dont think it is a religious war i think it is totally about lands and the occupied territory and the religion is what leaders try to take advantage to promote their own interests like what yassin did with the suicide bombers and said they will go to heaven they try to make it a religious war but it is not it is about lands i have a lot of friends here and my girlfriend she is muslim i am very serious about her and to tell you honestly most of the israeli people are not religious people the last time i was in synagogue was when i was 13 years old i had to do the bar mitzvah and since then i havent gone if you go to tel aviv 98 percent of the people are super liberal and they will accept you if are a palestinian if you are chinese if you are jewish if things go well i want to bring my girlfriend back home to israel
919798 that the religion and the state are connected you need to be jewish to be an important citizen but now things are changing now we have civil marriage in specific places that are recognized in israel and she can get citizenship
919799 do you know about the wahhabis that are coming here
919800 there are people telling me that people from outside are coming here to try to make religion a bit stronger
919801 nobody has shown any kind of problems against israel on the contrary because everybody here loves the u s and they all know that israel is like a state of the u s that is a good thing everybody knows the support that israel gets from the u s you dont need to be well educated to know that the amount of money israel gets from the u s means israel owes them a lot and thats how it works when israelis wanted to do military business with china they had to cancel it because the u s didnt like it
919802 so you think the primary reason kosovars like israel is because of the united states
919803 i think it is many things they had good relations with the jewish people back in the old days if you go back 40 or 50 years you will find that there were good relations with the jewish people they lived here happily also i think it is what happened in 1999 that showed them that israel cares and wants to help them and the people who came back here from israel say that it was amazing and they are still in contact with the families in israel nobody here is radical it is a muslim country but i think it is a beautiful muslim country i think israel is a more religious country than here
919804 i was in a jewish meeting for all of the balkans about two years ago i usually dont go to these kind of meetings because i feel much more an israeli than a jew but i went because i used to work for this company and my colleague who was also israeli and was a bit more religious wanted company so i went to belgrade and novi sad but since then i havent visited i can tell you honestly i like it better here than in bosnia and serbia i dont know why maybe because i am living here and what happened i was a part of it i dont know
919805 it wont and thats the whole point religion can co exist for example my girlfriend you know i am in love above my head i want us to be together i dont think religion should i think the opposite i think religion should integrate
919806 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919807 al qaeda failed in iraq because they were too violent sectarian violence is down not because of the surge but because there are really no mixed neighborhoods anymore and walls keep everyone apart those are good things to see but really what did those have to do with the surge nothing at all of course
919808 i think it would be better to spend a few months in the trunk of a car or even to die than to spend an entire life watching people maybe many people be killed by murderers who were released on my behalf but those are just my personal beliefs and i have no ability to influence israeli policy
919809 what sort of people refuse to return the bodies of their enemies until they get something in return the bodies
919810 perhaps this is just my western sense of honor speaking but what sort of people refuse to return the bodies of their enemies until they get something in return the bodies this is not like holding pows or prisoners for exchange but something else entirely something much more barbarous you just dont hold the remains of your enemy
919811 sectarian violence is down not because of the surge but because there are really no mixed neighborhoods anymore and walls keep everyone apart
919812 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919813 but nuclear technology came thanks to our use of violence and look at what troubles that has wrought upon our world
919814 we said how dare the vile petty viet cong brownie stand up to us
919815 america needs to lose and badly we need to get our butts kicked
919816 but my words here are futile so this will be my last comment
919817 i seem to recall you were quite supportive of israels bombing of lebanon over 1000 lebanese killed by a policy you supported but my memory could be wrong
919818 i bet you couldnt even advocate those views in berkeley without getting your ass kicked all the way down the street
919819 without getting your ass kicked all the way down the street
919820 more decisive and forceful action to prevent the unfolding horror
919821 not since the horrors of world war ii had europe witnessed massacres on this scale
919822 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919823 the war in bosnia will look like a tea party if serbian nationalism runs wild in kosovo

919825 after two years of traveling almost exclusively to western europe and the middle east
919826 poland feels like a geopolitical spa i visited here for just three days and got two years of anti american bruises massaged out of me
919827 americans are our best friends in the world uk is second
919828 i asked you why you are taking pictures of my caf
919829 i am muslim my father just wanted me to have a christian name
919830 i like hillary but i love bill he is my guy you understand why
919831 maybe the leadership is bad but some serbs are good i have serb friends here they like to come and have coffee in my cafe
919832 we are not like iraqis or palestinians who dont want change and seem to enjoy living in poverty here everyone is thinking about progress and the future
919833 all albanians all kosovars they feel more close in all ways to the west that to the arab world why because still none of the arab league countries have recognized kosovos independence the reason why is because libya and many other countries are linked with serbia israel would have recognized us by now but politically they cant if they do we are automatically doomed for another 59 countries not to recognize us i think very highly of israel i like jewish people a lot
919834 in albania and kosovo we are in support of israel i would never side with the muslim side to wipe israel off the face of the world 90 of kosovo feels this way the reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us we were muslims even in the second world war stronger muslims than we are now but even then we protected them with our lives our grandfathers protected the jews wherever they were in the region
919835 because the serbs became more aggressive they used more ruthless methods
919836 i sent food support and other needed supplies to the population affected by the war
919837 that means i had the opportunity to visit the areas directly affected war zones in prishtina it was normal the lights were on normal in the sense that we had gotten used to being beaten by serb police and to being offended for the last 10 years it was daily common life it was nothing new but in the countryside they were having very bad experiences i saw dead bodies on the road
919838 my whole family fifteen of us were sent to a train station at gunpoint
919839 did you see your serb neighbors again after you saved them
919840 the young athenian in plato i presume that you are reading this because you desire a closer look and that you too are properly disturbed by your curiosity perhaps in examining this extremity with me you hope for some understanding some insight some flicker of self knowledge a moral or a lesson or a clue about how to behave in this world
919841 i was scared they were going to take a member of my family my sister if they had taken my sister it would have been good to kill her but they wouldnt kill her they would rape her they would god knows we went out they took us to another wagon they stopped again in another city and again the military police entered the train wagon and took people out i dont even want to tell you what happened to them when we reached the border with macedonia we got out of the train the serb police and paramilitaries were saying to people dont go off the fucking tracks because everything is mined now you have kids elderly they were fucked up they were not hearing it
919842 they expelled 800 000 albanians in 3 months when we reached there were about 100 000 people living in the open in cold weather pregnant women were delivering people were dying the refugees were very ill treated by the macedonians i was there three days and now i think it is not human to screw up this bad believe me at that time when you watched schindlers list you sympathize with the jews but without going through that situation yourself it is impossible now when i watch schindlers list goose bumps go all over my body before that it never happened because we had never suffered like the jewish people thanks god but it was the same process mentally it destroyed us we suffered a lot if we had the chance then we would have killed them but after that are we killing serbs anymore no serbs are living here we are not slaughtering anybody we are not on a witch hunt anymore
919843 they took a family and put them in the basement the soldiers went and pissed on them when they left they threw grenades on them it killed them all except for one kid who survived this is what i can never explain to myself and i cannot justify what human beings can do even beaten on drugs you cannot do that i dont know how it is to experience killing children for nothing why because they are bosnians because they are albanians because they are serbs because they are bloody croatians as i said it is difficult to forget about it the more you think about it the more you get different thoughts in your head so it is best right now we ignore that and try to move forward and hopefully in a better life we will really forgive one hundred percent we forgave them for what they have done in a sense but not truly from our hearts because they have never accepted it what they have done to this day they say that we are the villains that we are the monkeys with tails today
919844 and said i am sorry i cannot sit in this chair any longer they said why i said there is no hole for my tail then they started laughing as much as i was offended by this i was very happy for them to see that for fucks sake you guys you have been burned with propaganda you live 400 kilometers away and you know nothing about us you jackholes
919845 with bg license plates on their cars let them come nothing will happen people may not like them but nothing will happen to them because 2004 cost us a lot it cost kosovo our earlier independence and recognition by the un we had to wait another 4 years
919846 was the international community worried you would do something crazy
919847 if you ask anyone about 2004 they will say what a fucking mistake it screwed us up
919848 the most important thing is for kfor to be in kosovo
919849 kfor is the ultimate thing that has to be here
919850 you will find most of the households without males you find most of the women if not old raped that means some of them were pregnant this ill fate bosnia suffered even more many women in bosnia were left pregnant today their kids are considered bastards in bosnia they dont have a future they are ill treated by serbs they are ill treated by their parents they are ill treated by the whole bloody country
919851 even the mother i have watched a lot of documentaries about it they are having horrible problems horrible problems i went to belgrade and i am still trying to say to myself that not all serbs are bad and i hope i am right
919852 is they have destroyed that womans life and they have destroyed the new life that comes to be born and they have created a mess in bosnia in croatia in kosovo whatever they have touched bosnians and croatians they defended themselves croatians when they took action to take the serbs out they committed atrocities beyond imagination but they had to take the bloody serbs out of the country they had to fight when you fight for your own house your own family believe me you dont see in black and white you see only black there is no gray or white only black
919853 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919854 we dont pray 5 times a day like the sunnis
919855 we are similar to ismailis and were treated badly in turkey because we dont go to the mosque here in macedonia the sunnis dont treat us as muslims they say this sometimes they want to be the only one representing the entire community and they say we should come under their umbrella
919856 but now were dressing like them this is not nice for us we are close to americans not the middle east we dont have that in albania
919857 but it has always been worse in macedonia there have always been more fundamentalists here macedonia is poorer and less educated now it is getting better but it is changing slowly
919858 most of them moved to america they will never be back
919859 why is it so much worse here than in kosova
919860 thanks to america and nato if kosova cooperated with muslim countries instead it would be different americans are bringing their culture to kosova and albania but not to macedonia
919861 they feel close to serbia but george bush recognized macedonias new name so they are more pro american now the name is important here i can understand
919862 they say the new colors are not as good as the originals
919863 they took it from us and turned it into a classroom for their propaganda an egyptian woman teaches albanian women in arabic even though no one speaks arabic here dont let anyone see you take a picture of it
919864 they ripped down our bektashi flag they broke the spindles on the shrine here and stole the donation box and they threatened the dervish
919865 we light up the flag with a candle at night do you know what those slots are for
919866 some clerics were at one tekke fighting the turks and the turks came and occupied it inside were some non bektashis some orthodox christians and they were hidden in the tekke the baba was very well known and he took these christians put dervish clothes on them and introduced them to the turks as dervish mark and dervish michael the same names just with dervish added so this baba covered them and saved the lives of christian people both the christians and muslims were fighting for the albanian cause the bektashis will fight against occupation for freedom for schools for educating people equality and tolerance are our values
919867 the first cleric leader in the world who judged this crucial attack as non human was the world bektashi father at the headquarters in tirana he publicly denounced this attack he even went to the embassy of the u s to present his judgment
919868 how long have you had problems with the wahhabis here
919869 serious trouble started three years ago when they broke gravestones
919870 they didnt respect our saints they also broke pictures of imam ali on the walls and of the world head of the bektashis they cut the pictures with knives they think we are too close to christianity in part because of the pictures and candles
919871 then the sunnis came in and occupied the tekke they said
919872 they want to convert the tekke into a womans madrassa they want to move their administration here
919873 they are and our government is weak arabs can manipulate us because our government is neglectful
919874 it is convenient for the government because they can point at albanians and call us terrorists
919875 this pope jovan vranishkovski is under serbian and greek influence he is paid by the serbs because he is preaching at his church in serbian the macedonian church is not recognized by the serbs or the greeks
919876 the macedonian orthodox church is against preaching in serbian in macedonian territory
919877 are the greeks and the serbs working together on this
919878 because the serbian church is supporting the greek church against recognizing the macedonian church as independent the greek church can recognize the macedonian church as independent but not under this name they are not recognizing the name of the state and they are not recognizing the language plus they are not recognizing the church the muslim community is supporting the orthodox church against this pope and saying you should be independent and this pope should have his own church in macedonia the muslim community is supporting the orthodox church so the orthodox church is supporting the muslim community against us and the macedonian government is under the influence of the orthodox church plus this political party the national political party they are investing a lot of money in the church building process mosques also etc so you see this government is sacrificing bektashism because of the problem of the orthodox church with the pope
919879 some of our buildings were damaged in the fighting we are a minority
919880 but individually there may have been some involved we are always against fighting we are for finding peaceful solutions in the past bektashis were involved in making wars but it was for the albanian cause mainly against the ottomans and for making an independent albania we were very deeply involved in this as bektashis we are not against the state and the state rules wherever we are for example bektashis are in 31countries greek bektashis are fighting for the cause of greece albanian bektashis for the albanian cause we respect the rule of the state no matter where we are bektashis in america will fight if america is involved in a war to protect america and american rules
919881 someone in kosova was recently arrested for smuggling weapons into macedonia
919882 at night you could hear weapons shooting just two days ago someone was shooting near here someone was shooting from here inside the tekke many times we have reported to the police that people are shooting from inside this part of the tekke at night
919883 and he has noticed that the people from outside are not only trying to scare us with weapons but are also looking at them as enemies and trying to provoke them in any way they can the sunnis are looking at the people coming here with an unfriendly eye even the guests that used to come here often are now not coming because they are scared they are always provoked the only people coming to the tekke are the people who must come who have something important to do
919884 they are trying to make us not come here at all
919885 they are trying to take over everything it is a cycle of aggression i was alone when the crucial attack happened i saw some people speaking albanian when i went out behind to feed the chickens they attacked the grave of a saint they broke the shrine and they stole the donation box they also broke the bektashi flag the green one that was just next to the albanian flag they didnt touch that one the national flag the albanian flag they just broke the bektashi flag this means the attack was done by muslim people if it was macedonians they would have broken both flags so muslims did this for sure also there was a verbal attack after this from the people praying in our place that has been transformed into a kind of mosque
919886 some are trying to accuse us of doing this to ourselves
919887 but bektashis never do things against their properties all bektashis believe in the same graves we keep them and pray to them we believe that if we damage a grave god will punish us so we are very afraid to do this we would never do this we keep the saint graves the muslims know this they are trying to provoke us and claim that we have done it to ourselves but no really they did it plus i see these wahhabis around usually at night the wahhabis are coming sometimes in trousers sometimes in their clothes sometimes with the things on their heads and with beards
919888 you see what we have to listen to five times a day this is supposed to be a quiet place for meditation
919889 when they had full control of the city because of the conflict the war they were coming preaching to the local people preaching wahhabism when they came here the wahhabis with the intent to take full control of the muslim community they used these people who had been studying in saudi arabia and other arab countries they were using them to put them in some of the mosques and now they are in control of eight mosques with these people who had been studying in the arab countries but they couldnt succeed in taking full control of the muslim community so now they are trying other ways to get influence like preaching to the local people their way of believing trying to have some control and even having some ideas of how to transform the tekke into their center they couldnt succeed in taking full control of the muslim community because the muslim community is not only macedonian but it is kosovar and from other balkan countries and their religion is influenced by the hanafi turkish school it is hanafism they are now trying to at least change this tradition from hanafism into their tradition they are mainly wahhabis salafi wahhabis they are using the fact that the local people are poor and unemployed they are paying them to convert to wahhabism also they are making people pray five times a day
919890 maybe 200 or 300 dollars or euros per month they are paying more to convert women
919891 so these are people who have studied in the arab world and are bringing the ideas back from there
919892 has there been any violence here between the bektashis and the sunnis
919893 because we have the support of the american embassy and also the albanian political party in government once we get support from someone they get angry and try to provoke us but we stay away we dont get involved in violent acts there have been some attempts at attacks but small ones no physical attacks just small attempts we always escape from such situations such a conflict is exactly what they want
919894 the muslim community is having some problems with these wahhabis but these are small problems the muslim communities are all against them which is not the case in macedonia in albania they are always against them we dont have that here the muslim population of albania and kosova is more educated we have recently a university in albania so they are more educated and they dont get easily involved the wahhabis are always trying to get involved and it is easy for them to get involved in the less well educated population and the poor population
919895 is the tension with the bektashis and the sunnis only with the wahhabis
919896 these parts of our buildings are taken by violence from the sunni community so in a way we have a problem with the sunni community but the basis is the wahhabism it is mainly the wahhabi part of the muslim community but also they are using the wahhabis to realize their goals so we have a problem with both
919897 they were shooting at each other during the elections for the president of the muslim communities in macedonia the one who was to be chief of the muslim communities was on the blacklist of america his name is zenun berisha he was the president of the skopje branch of the muslim community and he pretended to become the president of the muslim community of macedonia he is on the american blacklist because of his links with foreign extremists he wanted to be the head but he didnt succeed and they used firearms they didnt kill but they did this with violence
919898 we never had that take a picture take a picture
919899 it is convenient for the government because they can point at albanians and call us terrorists
919900 me against my brother my brother and i against my cousin my brother cousin and i against the stranger
919901 because their pope is preaching in serbia the macedonian orthodox church is not recognized by the serbs or the greeks the serbian church is supporting the greek church against recognizing the macedonian church as independent under this name
919902 the muslim community is supporting the orthodox church against this pope so the orthodox church is supporting the muslim community against us and the macedonian government is under the influence of the orthodox church
919903 they stoutly deny any connexion with the rroms and to call them
919904 second and i know what you are thinking his skin tone is not even indicative of roma ancestry while noticeably darker than the average albanian it is much more olive than brown
919905 but this is not all you seem to have no understanding of the albanian islam you confuse the ottoman islam of macedonians with the wahabi islam muslims of macedonia follow the same form of islam as muslims of turkey many of those ppl calling themselves albanians in macedonia nowadays are in fact ottoman turks albanianised during the decades of tito however you confuse and connect them with wahabism in such a miraculous manner that you seems better than g bush who was showing wmd in iraq before the war
919906 im confused on which skin tone is olive im half albanian but i dont pretend to be an expert and i dont know the language and my skin tone is more olive i also lived with a roma family in mk for 2 weeks and a roma family in nis serbia for a week now i agree with you that their skin color is not indicative of their ethnicity but it is commonly accepted among roma that their ancestry either comes from persia or india of course this all depends on where you are when youre speaking with roma
919907 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919908 in the two years that i covered the conflict in kosovo
919909 never once did i see the mujahideen fighters i saw in bosnia or hear kla soldiers even allude to any kind of commitment to islam most said they were offended by such allegations bragged about how they were catholic before the ottomans came and converted them and said their only religion was albanianism
919910 we were approached by fundamentalist muslims from every direction al qaeda but most of the leaders of the kla just didnt feel right about working with them
919911 i would have cooperated with the devil to free my country i didnt care who they were
919912 so after but there were still signs of the civil war i noticed in lebanon shias and sunnis hezbollah and these kind of parties they hate each other more than they hate christians its very bad
919913 why is it that islam in the balkans is more open and tolerant than in the middle east
919914 another reason is because we have cultivated tolerance between different religions
919915 i know there is more tolerance here because i can see it and i can feel it
919916 but at the same time there was a huge war
919917 but it was not a religious war in bosnia we can say that islam is the only element divides bosnians from serbs because they speak the same language and have approximately the same culture the faith was the one element that divided serbs from bosnians
919918 we havent had anything to do with serbs and the slavic language and the slavic culture our culture is different our language is different and they hate us they wanted us to leave kosovo since 1800 they tried to force albanians to go other places we have places in serbia that have been inhabited by albanians i come from serbia many cities have been albanian they know that they forced them to leave that part and come here and were converted to islam in the 18th and 19th centuries since then the serbs have taken the policy a very bad policy that since you have embraced islam you are turks and you should go to turkey so for albanians you can say this is a very important point never use religion to fight against serbs they didnt for example say lets take guns and fight serbs in the name of god because they also know that they have albanians who are orthodox and we have also christians and catholics
919919 the serbian government and people are still thinking that kosovo is not an independent state
919920 and they are creating the myths you know the myths that kosovo is like jerusalem for them unfortunately i am afraid that they will continue these myths and in the future and will try and create problems they are saying look what you have done you have created an independent islamic state
919921 the rest of the world doesnt know what to think
919922 there are no journalists here if the serbs say there is a fundamentalist state here people dont know they think its true
919923 we cannot deny that but as you see in the street it is completely different here people are muslims but they think like europeans you should write about this because people dont know it
919924 what about the very conservative muslims coming here from saudi arabia and building mosques
919925 it is a problem in my opinion but as you know during the war we had 250 mosques destroyed and burned the serbs wanted to call this war a religious war to get sympathy from europeans they still do that after the war many humanitarian organizations came here in general from the gulf kuwait qatar others we havent had rules we havent had a government all things have been under the u n so they opened the door to these kind of organizations they operated legally we couldnt have control why because they have the money and that is why we have not been in the position to stop these kind of steps they say we have money we can help you build a mosque and we will make the architecture and they have also misused their position toward us this was in the beginning after the war now it is a better situation because now they cannot do anything they want
919926 there have been moments when the u s and the international community have made pressure on them
919927 the involvement of wahhabis causes concerns in the u s
919928 they are from outside and i am convinced that neither here or in albanian churches will albanians allow them to continue
919929 i am a scholar i know how to deal with islam in my country there is no need for arabs to come here i have no need for their suggestions no need for their explanations our policy should be open for all countries they are muslims we are not against them but we are against the way they are using islam in my country we have our own schools this is not new here they have been here for 600 years we created our islam ourselves here and we can continue our islam with our own minds if they want to support us they should support the faculty support me as a scholar not create their own schools their own mosques because that makes trouble
919930 the mujahideen called the war a holy war and they wanted to call the war here a holy war but it was not a holy war it was a war against the serbian regime and paramilitary forces so to prevent this we told them no you cant have an attitude like that you can send money to buy guns but you cannot be with us in the war that was a good idea they destroy everything they touch
919931 thought fighting the right kind of war was more important than winning or did you expect nato to intervene so the mujahideen were not necessary what was the exact thought process
919932 the mujahideen would go through the kla but create another team there would be a team who fights in the name of god and a team who fights in the name of nationalism so in order to prevent this kind of problem they were told no from the beginning if you want to help us with guns against the serbian regime you can help
919933 i saw it with my own eyes in the u s religion is very free everybody is free to do whatever he wants to worship the god he wants i saw it with my own eyes
919934 the muslims here are on the side of the americans
919935 they had to stop this kind of dictatorships in the middle east saddam hussein killed many innocent people and he was going to continue his wars against his neighbors that was a good step to remove him from his position but the pictures that we see on the tv are bad pictures for us and i think also for americans who wants to see american soldiers die in iraq or who wants to see innocent people women children old people die i think there is going to be a solution but they cannot leave they cannot leave shias and sunnis hate each other more than they hate americans
919936 and they pay people to get covered to shorten the pants
919937 i dont know for sure most likely true they have money gulf money not just from iran but albanians are very traditional so it is difficult to get them to change their traditions it is difficult for the wahhabis to get roots here in kosovo
919938 you should see how the general public receives these people
919939 they certainly are not liked i dont think they will succeed
919940 i see an occasional person who i can tell is from one of these mosques
919941 i dont even see them around much and now they have this new mosque in the city center and they are gathering there they destroyed the old mosque and built a new one five years ago
919942 the walls were one meter thick stone all that was destroyed was the roof and they could have renovated it
919943 because in the kosovo constitution all european standards are applicable and if you look at it from the point of view of european conventions and human rights they have a right to religion yesterday we had a case where a young girl was denied entrance to a school because she was covered as human rights officers it is a problem we have to deal with because she has a right to preserve her religion that is her choice
919944 we dont have a law that says she can or cant come to school
919945 but these are very tricky cases in europe also in france it was a big problem i attended summer school in 2003 in england in south wales we had one international night and i was shocked to find that the representative of the usa was a covered lady originally from iraq and the representative from canada was another originally from afghanistan the topic for the conference was young people changing the world it had nothing to do with religion but they were representing the u s and canada
919946 and lumnije coming from a muslim country was wearing shorts
919947 the problem is that this issue has not been raised except for when they talk about the mosques i havent noticed any journalists tackle this thing i am sure this issue will soon arise but until the 17th of february everybody was obsessed with the independence issue now i am sure it will come up what happened yesterday at the school when one covered girl was not allowed to enter i am sure this case will come up and they will start to deal with it i hope that they will deal with it at some essential level regulating it by law in for example there is one girl who is covered but she is a professional interpreter very well educated at one point the kosovar delegation went to germany and they hired an interpreter and she was supposed to go when they saw that she was covered they refused to take her
919948 the kosovars refused to take a covered woman to germany as a professional interpreter
919949 and the u s sends a covered iraqi woman to wales as a representative
919950 they didnt want kosovo to be perceived as a conservative muslim country
919951 the majority of us would not like to be perceived as a muslim country in the real sense of the word
919952 and not seen any evidence of it that weve reached the assumption that it is not a viable threat
919953 i dont think kosovo will ever follow the path of the middle east
919954 i sincerely believe it we as muslims were never fundamentalists in any kind of aspect all of my family has been muslims for over 300 years we were never practicing muslims like they are in the middle east we are quite open quite liberal in that respect the biggest proof of that is within albania we have catholics we have orthodox and we have muslims first of all we are albanians religion comes second to us it is not like the countries in the middle east where the religion comes first to us religion comes second first of all is to create a better life for us
919955 for the 50 years they were under enver hoxha nobody dared to practice any religion there was no god for them there was only hoxha for 50 years it was very bad bosnia has suffered a lot but what albanians have suffered is unbelievable nobody can even explain it to themselves honestly really he brainwashed them away from religion people dont believe in anything as soon as you dont believe in anything you have a problem with everything you dont even know where to start and now they are slowly starting to come back into beliefs it took them 18 years but a lot of people are changing and actually quite a few muslims are no longer calling themselves muslim but are saying i am christian which is fine because they dont know what islam even is they never touched it they never went to a mosque
919956 saudi arabians are not going to change their brand of islam because of the albanian interpretation is more appealing to the people living there and of course it is
919957 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
919958 you do not have a license to use this control
919959 the amniotic stem cells grew readily into independent cell lines or colonies doubling in just 36 hours the paper says it was published in sundays edition of the journal nature biotechnology the researchers at the wake forest university school of medicine in winston salem n c were able to get the amniotic cells to differentiate into fat bone muscle blood nerve and liver cells stem cells can develop into almost all cell types and serve as the repair system for the body

919961 the news reports are completely false and baseless there are no such plans
919962 newcastle united owner mike ashley is in talks with anil ambani the sixth richest man in the world and head of reliance communications indias biggest telecom company
919963 ashley however was not able to spend anywhere near as lavishly as most of the newcastle united players demanded
919964 he has made it clear he will not sanction the kind of huge signings which might help challenge for a champions league place
919965 with early bound no interop calling local vb net method
919966 theres been a growth in some of the larger websites in their development and internet based sales which obviously if they can grow that its very cost effective and very low margin
919967 a unit of cultural information such as a cultural practice or idea that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another
919968 great is the truth and mighty above all things and will prevail
919969 the undeniable truth is that the new testament by contrast with the early fathers and by contrast with its own practice in relation to the books of the hebrew bible never actually quotes from or ascribes authority to any of the apocrypha
919970 as regards the earliest christians we saw evidence in the new testament of a knowledge by different writers of wisdom ecclesiasticus
919971 were generally read in the church for purposes of edification and in this sense the canon would always include more or less the apocrypha
919972 from the other point of view the canon the narrow one consisting simply of the books of the jewish bible which scholars like melito athanasius jerome took the trouble to distinguish from the rest as alone acknowledged
919973 whether or not we should regard the books just listed the apocrypha as scripture there is no doubt that we should value them highly

919979 everything stated in the new york post regarding yesterdays conversation between senator obama and reverend sharpton is false and is either a fabrication of the post journalists who wrote the story or the supposed unnamed source for the story in my view there is a big difference between tabloid journalism and shoddy journalism this story is clearly the latter and is unacceptable
