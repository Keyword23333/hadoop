1830111 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
1830112 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
1830113 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
1830114 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
1830115 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
1830116 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
1830117 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
1830118 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
1830119 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

1830158 they just sleep in the processing areas there are no mosquito nets yet in the centres which may become more of an issue as the rainy season continues to push people into these shelters
1830159 even though the rainy season has shortened in recent years the annual rainfall amount has not changed which means we are seeing more intense rains coupled with land degradation throughout sub saharan africa this makes for ideal flooding conditions
1830160 much of the region practices subsistence farming farmers abuse the land until it is easily eroded and cannot withstand rain
1830161 most people are quick to respond but slow to prepare mindset change is what needs to be done we need to address underlying reasons why do we get flooding what have we done to contribute to it you get the community to propose solutions people have to think of ways to reduce risks so they are not victims
1830162 we dont have to go high tech early warning system we are already partnering with meteorological institutions that can provide us with data
1830163 when we ifrc try to do emergency drills with people in flood prone areas they think its a hoax and then the storms come catching them unprepared
1830164 people cut down trees for charcoal relocating people from a high risk waterfront area can be difficult so we have to be creative but we need to engage the community to raise its awareness about the alternatives if they do not prepare

1830167 lo debe aprobar el concejo pero nos ofrecen que dentro de la urbanizaci n que ellos est n llevando adelante intercambiar un remanente de tierras que tenemos por stas hect reas de su propiedad y es b sicamente lo que hicimos en el caso de chacra xi por lo que nos parece una noticia excelente
1830168 esto nos da la pauta que durante todo el a o que viene vamos a trabajar en esto y no voy a tener que esperar que el gobierno nos pague la deuda para adquirir tierras ahora debemos ver los mecanismos para hacernos de los fondos necesarios para hacer la infraestructura que rondar entre los 15 y 18 millones de pesos
1830169 con esto continuaremos con la pol tica de la misma manera que lo hicimos con chacra xi por eso cuando alguien que no tiene ni idea dice que el municipio no acciona por la crisis habitacional les digo que nadie particip para llegar a una soluci n junto al municipio que es la nica instituci n que est dando soluciones en r o grande
1830170 ante la imposibilidad de tener los fondos para poder salir a comprar tierras existe este ofrecimiento al que le damos la bienvenida porque de esta manera podemos pensar s lo en los fondos para la infraestructura
1830171 explicamos que r o grande ha invertido 17 millones de pesos en infraestructura sin tener en cuenta el valor de las tierras y fueron recursos propios y para esto no tuvimos el apoyo de nadie ni del gobierno provincial ni el nacional
1830172 lo que puede servir para financiar esto porque nos garantiza contar con recursos extras para llevar adelante este tipo de obras

1830183 the modelers tend to tweak them to align them the process is very incestuous
1830184 the modelers are trained to be very myopic and not to understand the uncertainty within their models they become very skilled at solving the little problems and ignoring the big ones
1830185 what climate models do well is give a broad picture what they are absolutely lousy at is giving specific forecasts for particular places or times
1830186 i find it far fetched that a planner is going to rush off with a climate scientists probability distribution and make an erroneous decision because they assumed they could trust some percentile of the distribution to its second decimal point
1830187 have serious limitations in simulating regional features for example rainfall mid latitude storms organized tropical convection ocean mixing and ecosystem dynamics
1830188 are sufficiently uncertain to compromise the goal of providing society with reliable predictions of regional climate change
1830189 they are part of the tradition of goats entrails and tea leaves they are a way of objectifying advice cloaking sensible ideas in a false aura of scientific certainty
1830190 models have great difficulty in predicting such sudden events and in explaining them
1830191 but geology tells us that catastrophe has happened in the past and is likely to happen again
1830192 20 jun 2008 extreme weather events will plague u s in future report says a government report synthesizing more than 100 academic papers forecasts that as the world warms the united states will be subject to prolonged droughts heat waves and more frequent downpours like the recent ones that have left much of the midwest under water issued by the u s climate science program the report forecasts that by mid century heat waves that now occur once every 20 years will take place once every three years

1830200 they want to remind people that their concern for inflation is genuine but they have no intention of doing anything about it right away
1830201 bottom line is theyre not going to change rates anytime soon so they went out of their way to minimise changes to the statement
1830202 theyre trying to create as few waves as possible theyre not going to be doing anything this year so theyd just as soon not have people speculate about their moves
1830203 the statement was put together with an intent to get the fewest number of dissents as possible
1830204 many of the fed presidents view inflation differently than the fed governors the divisions are pretty deep and it is hard to get a consensus statement because there isnt a consensus
1830205 you put that in the stew and theres nothing to do

1830229 pero tambi n rescatamos la actitud de la legislatura de generar un trabajo conjunto de todas las instituciones
1830230 se ejecute en funci n de funciones mixtas tambi n
1830231 tan s lo suspender el paro hasta esta noche y mantener la ocupaci n del edificio
1830232 complica cualquier posibilidad de avanzar en la resoluci n del conflicto
1830233 resolvieron suspender la medida por espacio de 24 horas y abandonar la delegaci n de educaci n que estaban ocupando
1830234 la condici n para que los t cnicos comiencen a trabajar en la forma de distribuci n del monto ofrecido por el gobierno era que depongan las medidas de fuerza y garanticen el dictado normal de clases hasta fin de a o
1830235 fue ante los legisladores de los distintos bloques pol ticos de la legislatura es decir ante los representantes de todos los sectores del pueblo quienes pudieron certificar la buena voluntad del ejecutivo para negociar y el compromiso que asumi para que monitoreen el cumplimiento de ambas partes
1830236 nosotros queremos reunirnos cuanto antes con los equipos t cnicos para avanzar en la confecci n de la nueva grilla y por eso nos parece preocupante que exista esta desinteligencia entre ushuaia y r o grande
1830237 como est n dadas las cosas con el ministerio de trabajo ocupado no hay ninguna posibilidad de concretar ninguna reuni n t cnica
1830238 en este momento los docentes de r o grande y las autoridades est n haciendo el acta de constataci n de las condiciones en las que quedaron las instalaciones del edificio que fue ocupado
1830239 ac en ushuaia hayan decidido quedarse en la secretar a de trabajo
1830240 querer mantener el conflicto porque no saben convivir en un marco de tranquilidad en el entendimiento de que se termina s raz n de ser
1830241 como est n dadas las cosas con el ministerio de trabajo ocupado no hay ninguna posibilidad de concretar ninguna reuni n t cnica
1830242 muy positivo porque los pudieron palpar la dificultad que hay para entablar un dialogo con la conducci n del sindicato y adem s porque ellos se presentaron como garantes de la propuesta que formul el gobierno
1830243 sorpresa por la decisi n que hoy adoptaron los directivos del gremio
1830244 insistieron tanto en que el monto que acordamos y cuando lo llevaron a la asamblea cre mos que la consecuencia natural ser a la normalizaci n de la actividad escolar
1830245 pero hoy nos encontramos con un rid culo cuarto intermedio hasta las 12 de la noche
1830246 no podamos avanzar en la concreci n del acuerdo con clases en las escuelas porque arce y a toda la c pula sindical viven a trav s del conflicto
1830247 siguen bajando y cada vez m s cosa que no nos consuela porque nosotros pretendemos que se normalice el sistema educativo totalmente

1830257 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about

1830259 dovie is my best friend i love dovie i love him so much that im able to complain about him and bother him whenever i darn feel like it
1830260 dovbear a man with his hashkafas in the right place that is assuming you think the right place is bashing chassidim superstition the zohar spirituality and kugel which i do
1830261 dov bear has fantastic attributes candor loyalty truth courage a razor sharp mind and he flatters no one

1830263 hes witty hes funny he appreciates the ridiculous in life and has no qualms about telling you when he thinks that youre being a moron
1830264 notwithstanding his misguided politics i am amused by the postings of dovbear
1830265 it all started last year when i read an article about how writers from a local newspaper decided to eat nothing but local foods for 1 week after reading about their experiences i was inspired to take
1830266 in addition to the amazing recipes this years challenge showed me a community more engaged in the local food movement
1830267 i already eat as much local as possible between whole foods and the farmers markets this is where i do all my shopping
1830268 whole foods market has always been a big proponent of eating local and supporting the farmers and producers who put their hearts into making the most delicious foods around
1830269 so although we may not have had tons of people sign up for the challenge we were able to engage and continue the conversation about the ease and importance of eating local so to the georgia newcomer who has never been blessed with fresh pasta from via elisa mouthwatering beef from harris family heritage beef creamy chevre from sweet grass dairy sipped one of georgias award winning wines or had peaches tomatoes squash or any other amazing georgia foods wake up and embrace what it really means to be georgia grown

1830278 you dont need to have seen the first traveling pants movie to get the gist of this one its a relief to go to the movies and see teenage girls acting like teenage girls as opposed to grown women acting like teenage girls and face it there are harsher sentences in life and in the movies than looking at attractive young people for two hours spending a bit of time worrying about their problems instead of our own

1830280 the filmmakers struggle to shoehorn a fascinating story about wine into some kind of screen genre or another but bottle shock is unable to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be and flops around between madcap comedy and rousing drama to borrow a wine snob term of art it lacks structure or to push the idiom a little further its a little too sweet with some pleasantly nutty notes and a baloney finish

1830297 hacked into the company email server and configured it to copy and forward all incoming and outgoing email to his personal account and then sold the information to the mpaa
1830298 the district courts holding is contrary to the plain language of the statute misapplies the law of this circuit and by setting a precedent for the government and others to engage in similar conduct without regard to the wiretap acts prohibitions dangerously undermines the statutory and constitutional privacy rights of every internet user
1830299 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1830300 this case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case the district courts holding would remove a vast amount of communications from the protection of the wiretap act as such those communications would at best be protected by the sca stored communications access act which provides significantly less protection against government access to communications most worrisome is that under the district courts holding law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of emails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1830301 the second case concerns a request by the department of justice doj to a federal magistrate judge in pennsylvania for authorization to obtain cell phone location tracking information from a mobile phone provider without probable cause the magistrate instead demanded that the doj obtain a search warrant based on probable cause and the doj appealed that decision to the federal district court in the western district of pennsylvania in an amicus brief filed thursday eff urged the district court to uphold the magistrates ruling and protect cell phone users location privacy

1830397 as discussed elsewhere in this report throughout the credit market crisis the behavioral characteristics of several classes of structured credit instruments have accounted for a significant fraction of the write downs and losses incurred by large integrated financial intermediaries hedge funds specialized financial institutions and other market participants moreover there is almost universal agreement that even with optimal disclosure in the underlying documentation the characteristics of these instruments and the risk of loss associated with them were not fully understood by many market participants this lack of comprehension was even more pronounced when applied to cdos cdos squared 4 and related instruments reflecting a complex array of factors including a lack of understanding of the inherent limitations of valuation models and the risks of short run historical data sets as a consequence these instruments displayed price depreciation and volatility far in excess of levels previously associated with comparably rated securities causing both a collapse of confidence in a very broad range of structured product ratings and a collapse in liquidity for such products

1830413 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
1830414 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
1830415 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
1830416 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
1830417 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1830418 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1830419 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
1830420 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
1830421 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
1830422 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1830423 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1830424 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1830425 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1830426 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
1830427 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1830428 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1830429 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1830430 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1830431 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1830432 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1830433 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1830434 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1830435 stay outta my life but if i cross a certain line e g abusing children then its perfectly ok to invade my home and take away my family

1830546 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from former iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1830547 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1830548 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1830549 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1830550 we want this question to go away so were going to call it ridiculous
1830551 in late september tenet returned from a meeting at the white house with instructions for cia
1830552 well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1830553 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1830554 even five years later richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1830555 took him aside and briefed him on the iraq operations groups next assignment the habbush letter
1830556 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible maguire recalls
1830557 a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1830558 what would have happened yesterday thats what i dont understand richers retired from the cia
1830559 but also hes a government contractor he runs an intelligence firm that lives on government contracts by and large
1830560 so you still stand by everything and say that perhaps these two guys were pressured
1830561 you know in this situation you know you can almost expect that they would be pressured you know its the testimony of a few people with so very much at stake well see how it unfolds
1830562 never says that maguire was in the chain of command it says in fact that rob talked to john maguire about it but maguire was going back to baghdad so his successor handled it
1830563 character assassination is what they do when they have nothing else to say
1830564 in a new book journalist ron suskind claims he has new evidence to show the case was more than a failure of intelligence it was he writes an out and out deception
1830565 the bush administration joined former top cia officials in denouncing a new books assertion that white house officials ordered the forgery of iraqi documents to suggest a link between iraqi president saddam hussein and the lead hijacker in the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks
1830566 two former cia officers tuesday denied that they or the spy agency faked an iraqi intelligence document purporting to link saddam hussein with 9 11 bomber mohammed atta as they are quoted as saying in a new book
1830567 the white house issued the statement on behalf of the former officials after a day of adamant denials from the cia and bush administration about the claim made in the way of the world a book by washington based journalist ron suskind
1830568 so who do you believe ron suskind who says that everything in the book is on the record many sources or the bush white house which is assailing suskind for
1830569 suskind who won a pulitzer while writing for the wall street journal has been watchdogging this white house ever since he worked with ex treasury department secretary paul oneill on the latters tell all book and the administration has never been able to wreck his reputation
1830570 a disdain for contemplation or deliberation an embrace of decisiveness a retreat from empiricism a sometimes bullying impatience with doubters and even friendly questioners
1830571 on the other end of the believability scale we of course have a white house long practiced in the art of deception
1830572 tony fratto a bush deputy press secretary uttered the standard denial about suskind yesterday
1830573 even if one is inclined to doubt the notion that the bush war team would actually fake a document in the service of better propaganda suskinds broader theme has long rung true that bush has spent much of the last seven years seeking only the kind of evidence that would square with his certitudes
1830574 when this came up on msnbc moderator chuck todd asked politicos mike allen whether this would lead the anti war crowd in congress to call for impeachment allen replied that it would give the lefty blogosphere something to grab onto
1830575 and so in less time than it takes to say dick cheney the subject is changed from what would be one of the most outrageous violations of the constitution in the history of the republic to a left right issue
1830576 if the white house asked the cia to cook up this disinformation aimed at the american people why shouldnt the righty blogosphere too be up in arms why doesnt every american regardless of political party have a stake in the truth and the rule of law
1830577 i know i know thats not chuck todds or mike allens jobs unfortunately the closest that the msm usually comes to weighing the evidence is saying ron suskind charges x and the white house denies it this is what is now called reporting
1830578 any such notion that we would engage in that kind of activity is just absurd
1830579 we this white house it is absurd to suggest that this white house would seek to punish someone for speaking out with a different view we welcome people with different views thats a healthy part of our democracy
1830580 we are very excited that we had a large number of our student athletes named to the all academic team because its a fairly significant honor

1830646 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work in this regard
1830647 the main thing to remember is that the negotiating track is open it is being pursued there are contacts between the parties
1830648 of course some parties do raise the issue of sanctions from time to time
1830649 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1830650 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1830651 more complicated than that as we all know but we do believe that dialogue can continue
1830652 we certainly do not believe that it is a foregone conclusion that it is not going to be successful

1830660 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
1830661 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
1830662 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
1830663 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
1830664 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream

1830679 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1830680 because of the size and scope of his criminal activity gonzalez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all the charges alleged in the boston indictment
1830681 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1830682 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1830683 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1830684 the biggest benefit of wireless is its biggest problem the signal goes everywhere
1830685 both wireless security and infrastructure vendors have so far focused on protecting the wireless connection and the back end network while the perimeter where attacks cannot be detected has remained undefended
1830686 rf barrier mounts a strong defense by blocking signals from the designated wireless network from being effectively decoded outside the perimeter keeping the data confined to the four walls of the enterprise a retailer need no longer worry about the bleeding of its financial data beyond the walls of the building as the first solution to provide cost effective perimeter wireless protection rf barrier can greatly expand the cios confidence in the security of both legacy and modern wireless networks

1830717 without an additional government policy jolt the economy is headed for a very slow second half of 2008 either the third or fourth quarters should register negative gdp growth
1830718 higher food prices will bring about new investments in agriculture and higher global production this is already happening in asia and other parts of the world and will accelerate over time without higher food prices land use would shift towards corn for ethanol and other biofuel crops and we would have less food available in the last analysis almost everyone agrees that we need faster rural development to alleviate poverty and hunger higher farmgate prices are a key element for this to happen

1830731 its somewhat disingenuous for other companies disney amp fox to suggest that they were not compensated for endorsing blu ray via either up front payments in kind marketing deals or other incentives both companies are known as being fiscally responsible and i agree i just didnt read the link i thought you included the entire article in op lol im so glad been wanting this game since last year so this is great news and thread worthy thanks it still doesnt say its coming soon it says that a price and mention when its being released is coming soon please stop make a reasonable argument and stop making blanket statements i never understood what was so sweet about this franchise anyone wanna enlighten me the soundtrack the speed amp the weapons all did it for me the 1st time i saw the quake disruptor warp the track the way it did in wipeout 2097 on the saturn and ps1 my eyes popped out of my head music wise having music from the likes of the chemical brothers leftfield underworld and the prodigy was also quite a boon for me beoing a fan gcold storages tracks were good too all downloadble for free in the link blu ray player 1 ps3 200gb upgraded 40gb pal connected to 21 latest i am legend resident evil extinction ps3 games owned 28 latest assassins creed computer imac 20
1830732 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone
1830733 on average titles that have downloadable content on xbl marketplace have seen a 16 percent longer period of people holding onto that title which keeps them from selling to secondhand stores
1830734 when you submit your title to certification you want to make sure that you follow the process of submitting dlc with your title it doesnt have to be complete or feature ready but it allows verification your title is ready for dlc
1830735 its great if you can think about dlc from day one or at least as early as you can in the development cycle so there are no hiccups
1830736 as long as you have an understanding of what youd like to do having that in your dlc plan will help you right away
1830737 that title update whether or not you add or change anything to your spa will force all of the changes youve made so far to their gamer profile
1830738 only the users who download dlc will get new updates in between title updates
1830739 the main reason for that is because certs job is not to test your content its there to protect the content protect our users and protect the service we provide theres no functional testing ever done on dlc submissions the most that will ever be done is to make sure that content complies with the technical certification requirements
1830740 okay if its not functional and if its not feature rich it just needs to be consumed by the title and not crash
1830741 if youre going to be submitting it as sample content when that sample content is downloaded you could be level 1 as opposed to level 20
1830742 content should behave in a way when its on the system that makes it identifiable from content that ships on the disc
1830743 typically if the dlc is not present the game can continue without that as long as you inform the player why they might not have access
1830744 even with episodic content you should be able to play episode five without episode four present even if you played episode four before
1830745 first you want to make sure you have your paid downloadable content release strategy in place
1830746 in order to complete your offer its going to help to have an idea of the types of content you want to release the release cadence you want if you have multiple types of content and where you want to release it
1830747 we dont offer default descriptions for in game content we cant possibly anticipate the great ideas youll have for your dlc
1830748 this is what the user will be looking at on marketplace when making a purchasing decision if it includes new achievements make sure you absolutely get this in the description
1830749 lets say that for your multiplayer title you want to include six new characters for the game and release them as dlc what we need is to get the bits onto the other players boxes so they can see and interact with them but not use them
1830750 a great basic way to get the content in front of your user immediately is to use the showmarketplaceui function and show the user the content from within the game
1830751 a much better way to do that would be to call that blade and have this great new content be the only thing on the blade
1830752 think globally think about where the title is shipping not just where its shipping initially even if you dont have a publishing group in another region keep those regions in mind
1830753 many users find ways to circumvent the ban by using powerful proxies
1830754 weaken the basis of iranian society with the aim of creating the conditions for a soft revolution
1830755 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1830756 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through

1830767 i was a lit major in college and used to be a voracious book reader
1830768 what if i do all my reading on the web not so much because the way i read has changed i e im just seeking convenience but because the way i think has changed
1830769 i now have almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print
1830770 ive lost the ability to do that even a blog post of more than three or four paragraphs is too much to absorb i skim it
1830771 perhaps you will through this instrument even take to a new idiom
1830772 thoughts in music and language often depend on the quality of pen and paper
1830773 our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts

1830776 disassociated time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences
1830777 remains an impoverished version of the older one for it rests on a rejection of those direct experiences that formed the basis for and indeed constituted the old reality

1830781 the ultimate search engine is something as smart as people or smarter
1830782 for us working on search is a way to work on artificial intelligence
1830783 certainly if you had all the worlds information directly attached to your brain or an artificial brain that was smarter than your brain youd be better off
1830784 really trying to build artificial intelligence and to do it on a large scale

1830794 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant in the movie hes gone all out to get her in the film shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career and her life around a successful film could help her get out of her current nightmare
1830795 if we had our druthers wed have him stretched out and pitching every fifth day right now we feel like wed rather have him pitching in the big leagues than not at some point we might change our tune
1830796 but hes part of our bullpen hes not necessarily a bullpen guy we view him as a starter but thats what we need and charlie and pitching coach rich dubee will use him accordingly
1830797 it seems like the height of comedy to me when failed writers cast aspersions on successful writing i guess i would be pissed off too if i tried so hard for so long with nothing to show for it and then some big dumb rapey fratty came out of nowhere to spend three years on the best seller list and got a movie made of course if that happened to me i would stop and reevaluate what i was doing wrong and he was doing right but thats just me and im not very smart just successful
1830798 after a short period of conversation in english it became clear to me that the dvd was showing porn it was playing at the loudest possible volume thereafter for the next month the porn movies were played all night

1830804 the conviction is illegitimate because it rested on evidence that never would have been admissible in trial in a u s civilian court in a criminal case
1830805 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values

1830832 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract

1831765 a strict vicarious liability standard would result in the needed enforcement where the current standard failed because it would impose liability on the corporation whenever its agents performed an illegal act under this standard liability attaches regardless of any underlying expectations or company policies that may be in place as a facade if an employee is involved in hiring an undocumented worker the hiring activity is deemed to be performed as part of his duties for the company under a strict liability standard it is irrelevant whether the company expected the agent to hire a legal or illegal worker nor is it relevant whether an employee handbook forbids the hiring of illegal workers a prohibited activity has occurred and the corporation will be held liable for it 197 this is important because as discussed above a relaxed standard allows corporations to easily evade liability for immigration violations and thus no deterrent effect is realized

1831910 between now and the end of the year we expect further competitive expansion particularly in quebec new brunswick and newfoundland and labrador
1831911 it will be more important than ever to execute on our strategy to focus on the individual communities we serve by tailoring our offerings and strengthening our brand presence
1831912 our footprint could be between 60 and 65 per cent competitive by the end of the year if the markets open as they could
1831913 we determined that the opportunities in this base are best handled by large corporations that are primarily focused on defence security and aerospace
1831914 as we continue to reshape time warner well increasingly focus on our goal to create and manage high quality branded content
1831915 a separation of aol would eliminate whats been a drag on growth and a management distraction
1831916 some of time warners businesses most exposed to advertising like a lot of the other companies that reported so far did worse on revenue but had other revenue sources like subscriptions to offset that
1831917 while continuing to deliver double digit gains may prove increasingly difficult we do feel very very good about how things are pacing at turner

1831923 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1831924 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1831925 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1831926 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1831927 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye

1831932 pro evolution soccer has always been the game of choice for soccer enthusiasts due to its ultra realism and superior gameplay and there is no player in the world more suited to be on the box than the talented forward from barcelona lionel messi
1831933 lionel is one of the most exciting and accomplished players in the world and we look forward to working very closely with him to promote the most advanced pes title ever developed

1831939 its going to be impossible to make the team based on last years performance alone azinger said wednesday
1831940 you had to have played decent this year and if you look at the list i dont think you could make an argument that anybody in that top eight hasnt had a nice year
1831941 it would be really difficult to make an argument that the top eight players are not americas best azinger added
1831942 one more good shot here to get in the top eight is what were all looking to do mediate said
1831943 i told him a year and a half ago that i want to be on that team and it wasnt looking good until a few months ago so ive got a shot thats all you can really ask for it would be a lot of fun though i can tell you that
1831944 and i havent seen zinger since then campbell said wednesday reminded of that scene
1831945 a top three wouldnt be bad he said and that might be what it takes
1831946 its going in the right direction he said of his game
1831947 its pretty simple if im on the team ill be ready ive proven that having said that i need a miracle i dont think hes interested in anything but young bombers
1831948 if it were up to me id pick him right after i picked me verplank said with a laugh

1831950 so whoever is playing the best is being rewarded as far as im concerned because they held up under the pressure of three really difficult scenarios
1831951 this does not mean that small hold farmers will benefit from the current increase in prices
1831952 farmers in laos have been forced to put their tools down because there is no way they can make a living
1831953 may have only to walk down the road and sell their produce for a lower price than people are paying
1831954 the increase in prices as an opportunity to promote investments in agriculture in developing countries

1831977 with lahood we can ensure that incarcerated individuals will respect correctional officers and make for a safer workplace
1831978 our officers believe it is time for a change in the states attorneys office because the current states attorney has not tried cases for correctional officers as diligently as they should be tried thereby putting the officers in harms way the present states attorneys support of our department has dwindled over the years by not prosecuting violent crimes committed against our officers
1831979 these are the individuals who are on the front lines here in peoria they interact daily with murderers rapists and other violent criminals if they receive no support from the states attorney something is terribly wrong i wholeheartedly respect what these people put on the line on a daily basis and know they go the extra mile to protect all of our families as states attorney i intend to go the extra mile to give them the assurance and support that they desperately need

1832051 so much about traveling with the band happens behind the scenes fans only see the stage performances and occasionally they might shake hands or get an autograph
1832052 i wanted to not only open up life on the tour bus and in the dressing room so that fans could have a clearer understanding of what tour life is all about but also to let them know that the band is serious about their devotional life reading studying and praying together these are just regular guys like anyone else and they have their challenges in the christian life as much as anyone
1832053 maintaining a ministry focus and your own walk with god is a very real challenge for anyone working in the christian marketplace but in the long run the bands and the artists that flourish and have staying power are the ones that are firmly rooted in the local church and the passionate pursuit of god
1832054 god is still involved in the ministry of third day and i love being there in the middle of it all im just as genuinely excited now as i was 8 years ago
1832055 we cant decide who should cut this fish to divide it between us
1832056 but what is he going to do with the middle portion which has most of the meat
1832057 if only we had trusted each other instead of inviting an outsider to settle our dispute
1832058 if you want to enjoy life fill yourself with good thoughts
1832059 were in an environment when the banks are getting it from all sides
1832060 consumers are defaulting a little more than usual but also using their credit more than usual
1832061 that doesnt feel like a situation thats getting better it feels like they are being picked on
1832062 card issuers are viewing risk differently now than they did just a year or two ago
1832063 making your payments on time is no longer enough to be considered a good credit risk you have to keep your balances low relative to your available credit and be chipping away at that balance rather than skating by on minimum payments
1832064 between the sub prime crisis the housing market the economy and the fact that a lot of people are living off of their credit cards the banks are trying to immunize themselves against the point in time when more people will not be able to keep up with their credit card payments weve seen a lot of complaints from consumers who had been cardholders for years and had always paid on time and thought it would count for something but who have now seen their credit limit cut
1832065 but if i saw my credit line being cut id call and throw a hissy fit about it because you have no chance of seeing it readjusted without that you can shop around for other deals but that could be tough given your circumstances so start by talking to your card company they may be looking at everybody and deciding if theyre still a good risk but they still dont want to lose you as a customer
1832066 pay the bills on time be a good user of credit if you have to use credit and stand up for yourself if there are changes made that you dont think should have happened to you if you dont stand up for yourself you know the credit card companies will be doing whats best for themselves and not for you

1832084 ms perez and i first met when my magazine featured her for her illustrious music career her face graced our cover numerous times over the years perhaps youve heard of eva perez
1832085 according to my daughter kids in your age group dont comprise even a minuscule part of my fan base
1832086 actually i have heard of you ms perez my mom used to play your cds she was a serious latin jazz fan
1832087 i hope her taste in music hasnt changed i need all the fans i can get these days
1832088 desirees mother my daughter was killed in a car accident about a year ago
1832089 would you mind giving taylor a tour of the house while i go over some business details with her mother
1832090 and after the tour perhaps you could show taylor to her room
1832091 the blue room please inez has already taken some of taylors bags up for her thank you desiree
1832092 and thats where the bedrooms are but we can see that later
1832093 the kitchens back there but the cook clara can be a little witchy about trespassers
1832094 besides my grandmother does not want her girls to spend much time in the kitchen anyway
1832095 i dont imagine anyone is going to be exactly pigging out around here i mean arent we all supposed to become famous models or something
1832096 well my grandmother did edit one of the biggest fashion magazines in the world but i dont think that means were all going to become famous models i know im not
1832097 why not youve got the height the build and youre not half bad looking well other than the fact that you obviously have absolutely no style
1832098 but then youve got your grandmother to straighten that out for you
1832099 i think my grandmother will give up on me pretty soon especially when the others get here shell have girls with more promise to set her sights on
1832100 and thats the sunroom or observatory as grandmother calls it
1832101 hearing her talk about this house sometimes reminds me of playing clue
1832102 you know the murder game like where colonel mustard kills mrs peacock with a wrench in the observatory
1832103 yeah i told grandmother it was a necessity for school
1832104 this house has been in our family for a long time
1832105 but no one has lived here for the past twenty years my grandmother had it restored after she retired a couple of years ago
1832106 the bedrooms are on this floor and the third floor has a ballroom that would be perfect for volleyball although grandmother has made it clear that its not that kind of ballroom
1832107 and is it true that i have to share this room with a perfect stranger
1832108 do i get any say in who becomes my roommate
1832109 i guess you can take that up with my grandmother
1832110 these shoes might be marc jacobs but theyre killing me
1832111 dont the servants around here know how to put things away properly
1832112 dont you want to go down and tell your mom good bye
1832113 and make her think shes doing me a favor by dumping me here not on your life
1832114 and dont pile them on top of each other this happens to be louis vuitton you know
1832115 another girl just arrived your grandmother wants you to give her a tour too
1832116 this is my granddaughter desiree lane and desiree id like you to meet eliza wilton
1832117 her parents are presently residing in france where her father just purchased a vineyard but elizas grandmother and i are old friends we went to college together when she heard about what i was doing up here in connecticut she encouraged her daughter to send dear eliza our way
1832118 yeah i kinda thought that too after i got used to it to be honest it seemed pretty big to me at first but then youre probably used to big houses
1832119 in fact they almost refused to let me come here
1832120 oh i think they felt i was safer in boarding school if our grandmothers hadnt been such good friends im sure they never wouldve agreed
1832121 i think itll be fun to go to a real high school to just live like a normal girl with other normal girls
1832122 i guess i dont really know what normal is but its more normal that what im used to
1832123 i mean you must know about my grandmothers plans to turn us all into little debutantes are you into all that
1832124 thats nothing new remember im from the south my family is obsessed with turning me into a lady that was one of the other reasons my parents agreed to this i think they see the carter house as some sort of finishing school
1832125 some of the things that have been happening in last two to four years concerned me
1832126 if a candidate is less than 1 percent they can request a recount
1832127 we had one machine that when it got here the chip was having problems so we had to redo the chip and run ballots through and make sure the tape we got from the judges was accurate
1832128 in one case the lady who won ended up losing and in the other case guy who lost actually lost by one vote more
1832129 it will definitely change the vote it might not change it in my favor it might go against me
1832130 its kind of like a ball game if you win by one youre the winner
1832131 hey whats up things going well hows research and the job search
1832132 not really im stuck working on some papers for publication
1832133 no they arent going to be cell papers which means they wont get me a job which means ive wasted the past five years this area of research has no future
1832134 thats not really true is it you can do good work that isnt published in cell and still find a job
1832135 not really even if the work is good it doesnt matter the system sucks and there arent any jobs out there anyway no one here helps you get a job whats the use of working for a famous pi if i cant find a job but they dont help you find a job at all
1832136 its tough this project isnt going anywhere but the boss wants this work done right now but whats the use of doing this itll get me nowhere its too late for me now i dont know what ill do i can never get a job

1832141 shailaja has a chance but i think the iwf is in very embarrassing position at the moment
1832142 christianity is good for you but its not right for me i think you ought to believe whatever makes you happy and gives you peace
1832143 could you convince thousands of people in our own day that president kennedy had resurrected from the dead theres no way unless it really happened
1832144 it is an essential part of christian faith that jesus is god in a unique and exclusive way
1832145 i am the way and the truth and the life
1832146 can any of you point to one sin i have committed
1832147 the son of man jesus did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
1832148 christianity isnt about people in search of god but rather god in search of
1832149 god saved you by his grace when you believed and you cant take credit for this it is a gift from god salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done so none of us can boast about it
1832150 oh god here he comes mccain pretend you dont see him and lets just walk away real fast
1832151 this keeps me from talking out of both sides of my mouth
1832152 dont you just hate when that happens at a public event
1832153 hey mccain when are you gonna come pump some air in my tires
1832154 newt gingrich fumbles awkwardly to solute the newly announced presidential candidate ms paris hilton
1832155 psst mccain youve got something on your face just there
1832156 if mccain thinks that he is going negative he still has a long way to go to catch up to me
1832157 im all for offshore oil drilling but maybe i should have flip flopped on it at my dentists office
1832158 who sent the snow storm i said back to work
1832159 like i want to tag along with the newlyweds thanks but no thanks
1832160 yeah thats a good one gretch ill bet youre vegging out in front of hgtv with a carton of chocolate fudge brownie
1832161 itll be fun you can bring riley along hed probably like to stretch his legs
1832162 like he wouldnt want to go out and get some fresh air and sunshine
1832163 you mean that little shuffle you do over to the itty bitty park across the street from your apartment complex whats that take like seven and a half minutes for the whole round trip thats not enough exercise for a growing dog like riley
1832164 so theres nothing i can do or say to change your mind
1832165 but i cant expect the guests to provide everything for our home i figured i might as well get started myself look at this great set of espresso cups that i got at crate amp barrel last weekend for thirty percent off
1832166 and we need a real yard for you to run and play in
1832167 what happens when the dream you asked god for isnt what you thought it would be

1832172 um were not having a convention this year so like dont waste your time attending or anything
1832173 we cannot reveal the exact quantum of hike we have recommended but we kept in mind the stipends in other states a supreme court directive and the demand of the junior doctors while making our recommendation we proposed a more than 50 per cent hike
1832174 we will take into consideration the committees suggestion and implement an appreciable hike from september 1 this is a word of honour after this the doctors should call off the ceasework
1832175 we are happy with the announcement though we havent yet been told about the exact quantum of hike we have decided to call off our ceasework based on the governments assurance
1832176 our movement was apolitical and the demand was legitimate and we have achieved a moral victory within three days
1832177 a large number of patients were denied treatment and had to be referred to other hospitals
1832178 i kind of wished that the difference got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond if it its something thats already come out the balls not in anybody at rares court really its squarely in the license holders court its a shame its kind of locked in this no mans land theres nothing on live arcade theres nothing on wii

1832180 this generation of youth has really seemed to grasp the heart of a servant aspect of trying to be like jesus
1832181 the root of this is that the teens see jesus asking us to give a cup of cold water instead of just feeling sorry that someone is thirsty
1832182 this new generation of teens knows that a faith that doesnt cause you to act isnt much of a faith
1832183 i know our young people in childress are defining church more as something you are seven days a week not just something you do on sunday
1832184 one kid actually said he loved it because it was like he was living the scriptures
1832185 it is funny how a teenager can be so fired up about serving and yet so selfish at the same moment
1832186 parents often comment that the kid was different when he came home for a while
1832187 we wanted the teens to experience service outside of their usual context
1832188 we wanted them to see how different life can be just 55 miles away
1832189 with people that are so passionate about their faith because that is all they have
1832190 the trick is to remember why you are out here serving people
1832191 you have to remember that it isnt about you serving people is about being the hands and feet of christ
1832192 we are going to be very busy during siggraph this year first we are excited to be revealing some of our prototypes for upcoming products iz3d will be holding mini tournaments during the show so attendees can experience firsthand the immersive qualities of 3d gameplay we are thrilled that one of our top engineers oleg tishutin will be speaking about a new technique we developed to improve 3d image quality during the co located workshop edt ipt we are also pleased to announce neil schneider of mtbs a stereoscopic advocacy group that we strongly support will also be speaking during the computer animation festival

1832218 awakening from some dreaming depth in which i was someone and somewhere else i hear a knock on my hospital door oh yes the hospital the middle of the night i know where i am now your baby is hungry and awake the nurse says softly would you like to feed him in the dark i raise up my stiff heavy body on one elbow reach for the height adjusting buttons on the side rail of the bed and shove the pillows awkwardly into place behind me trying not to wrench any sore muscles or put any real weight on my bruised bottom the nurse hands me a little cocoon of blankets with a tiny face peeping out she shows me philips id tages but i know hes mine i already know that face once we get started the nurse leaves us alone and i lie there watching his jaw work and adjusting his position keeping him going with a jiggle or a stroke on his cheek half vigilantly attentive half in reverie half awake half dreaming utterly joyful yet frightened euphoric yet profoundly tired now i lie in the night stillness together with this new one and it seems we two are the calm center of all things and even if im half asleep i seem most truly conscious most connected to the real and right but it cant last a little more sleep and then daylight will come and baths and feedings and doctors examinations
1832219 the solemn clothes and black interior of the new rogan store on the bowery made me think of the band radiohead and other super serious artists like them who are always photographed with somber expressions in front of gnarled leafless trees

1832229 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km 500 miles is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close flyby
1832230 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1832231 i have read that asu plans to use its funds to address all of its identified fire life safety issues shockingly the u of a and nau plan to address only some of their critically needed repairs
1832232 there will be no students threatened in any way because of a lack at any of the three universities taking care of their deferred maintenance
1832233 i find it audacious for the speaker to raise concerns about the priorities of this spending when he voted against the entire package and opposed anything going to these three funds including health and safety
1832234 that means ua isnt fixing 17 million of life safety issues
1832235 we are being kept in the house forbidden to leave there are guards posted in the kitchen the bedrooms even the showers the phones have been cut
1832236 we are against the military and we are deeply against this coup we support sidi to the death
1832237 its a pity it took a military coup but i completely support the change it has brought
1832238 there were rumours about two weeks ago that might be a coup in the offing it was a bit of an open secret that two senior military commanders were fanning this split within the ruling party

1832244 are you leaving soon because boss asked me if i would be ready to take over your class in january
1832245 go to workshops all of the time and am always throwing in something new
1832246 thursday is much better i always arrive early and the girl who teaches before me always runs her class late so theres plenty of time to talk
1832247 werent you supposed to be attending a pilates class last month and writing an article on that
1832248 allow me this morning to give not a homily but to enlighten you in regards to a request that was made by a group of people in the diocese
1832249 those who signed the request do not respect authority because they continue to desire the tridentine mass
1832250 it is the bishop who is responsible for pastoral activity and for the liturgy in his diocese
1832251 the pope is not the universal bishop he is the bishop of rome this priest has the devil as his father and bishop rivest is not the vicar of the pope he is the bishop of chicoutimi
1832252 our bishop would surely not like me to say such things because he is a good man
1832253 most people who are attached to tradition are insecure and incapable of adapting to the modern world
1832254 most of those who made the request for the forma extraordinaria are between 20 and 30 years old thus they are people who do not know latin and who seemingly do not know the tridentine liturgy
1832255 the tridentine mass is not all that traditional after all since before the council of trent there existed other forms of celebration and the manner in which the apostles celebrated holy mass is totally unknown to us
1832256 if i asked you to raised your hand those who desire it the tlm i am not sure that there would be many of you with your hand raised

1832260 we really hope that once the video systems are installed and function that theyll serve as a major deterrent first of all second of all theyll be an extra investigator tool for our campus police but also that theyll be an administrative tool for our building administration so they can see whats going on have eyes all over the place so that theyre not relying on just people walking around but that extra level of technology that gives them 60 70 80 pairs of eyes to monitor whats happening at that site and outside their site
1832261 life is strange and often imponderable both success and failure find their roots in simple experiences darbys experiences were commonplace and simple enough yet they held the answer to his destiny in life therefore they were as important to him as life itself he profited from these two dramatic experiences because he analyzed them and found the lesson taught in each respectively but what does that mean for a person who has neither the time nor inclination to study his her failure to find the secret leading to success where and how will that person learn to turn defeat into a stepping stone to opportunity these are the questions this book was written to answer the thirteen principles the answer to these questions consists of thirteen principles all working in conjunction with each other but as you read remember the answer s you may be searching for the answers to the questions that have brought you to contemplate the irony and complexity of life may be found in your own mind through some idea plan or purpose which may spring into your mind as you read
1832262 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

1832284 the epic itself is basically about one man you pass through a lot of things but you never get to look at it with clone wars were not burdened by the mythological underpinnings we get to go more places
1832285 the story about anakin skywalker and his fall into the dark side and redemption by his son thats finished it was started when he was 10 it ends when he died theres no more story to tell all that stuff is really not part of what this is
1832286 when i was a kid imagining that there were other jedi knights beyond yoda was incredible weve never really seen those other characters fully developed and thats one thing we can really get into in this movie and in this series
1832287 also there are a lot of the clones that we can get involved with on the front lines and see just how they all contributed to this great republic that we always heard about in star wars and how it falls apart and becomes an empire
1832288 i try to stay very closely tied to the live action films as far as i dont want to interrupt the continuity that george created
1832289 but once we kind of moved away from one on one end and until we get towards revenge of the sith on the other theres a lot of room to explore

1832298 looking for someone to babysit 2 young children for 1 1 2 hours every other day
1832299 we are making it very clear to turkey that we dont think it is in their interest to send troops into iraq
1832300 actually they have troops already stationed in iraq and theyve had troops stationed there for quite a while we dont think its in their interest to send more troops in
1832301 whats important is the parliaments decision not what people say
1832302 if turkey conducts any attack or operation against our bases in iraq or kurds anywhere we are prepared to defend ourselves and we have prepared well for such an occasion we do not want a military confrontation but we will spread resistance throughout turkey and kurdish areas in iraq iran and syria
1832303 we consider activities of pkk against the interests of the kurdish people first and then against the interests of turkey
1832304 we have asked the pkk to stop terrorism to end the so called military activity
1832305 the kurdistan regional government should not allow pkk terrorists to infiltrate in to turkey from northern iraq
1832306 the iraqi government will not use its army and police to stand in front of the turkish army because security in that region is the responsibility of the multinational forces and the peshmerga
1832307 it is the constitutional duty of all iraqi forces to protect the borders
1832308 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
1832309 acted under the direction so this tells us that the second priesthood restoration must have happened after may 15 1829
1832310 peter and james and john whom i have sent unto you by whom i have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles and especial witnesses of my name and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which i revealed unto them
1832311 for some time made this matter a subject of humble prayer
1832312 got together in the chamber of mr whitmers house in order more particularly to seek the lord what we now so earnestly desired
1832313 ordain oliver cowdery to be an elder in the church of jesus christ and that he also should ordain joseph to the same office and then
1832314 will further illustrate the nature of our calling to this priesthood as well as that of others who were yet to be sought after
1832315 paul mine apostle for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called
1832316 at a period when joseph and oliver were being pursued by their enemies
1832317 the restoration of the melchizedek priesthood didnt occur because of these problematic sources
1832318 the restoration of the melchizedek priesthood did occur because of these trustworthy sources
1832319 a confirmation and reception of the high priesthood after the holy order of the son of the living god
1832320 interesting account of several remarkable visions and of the late discovery of ancient american records
1832321 cowderys call as an apostle was a vocal command like paul
1832322 this did not yet refer to the office of high priest which though appearing in the book of mormon was not yet applied to individuals in the restoration
1832323 you must wait yet a little while for ye are not yet ordained

1832329 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

1832354 being open to creation in different forms not setting limits and following your own heart voice and vision
1832355 you have to be self motivated and their is a whole lot of responsibility
1832356 like getting a letter in my mailbox from a friend customer from japan saying how much she loves the piece she just ordered or having the sunlight shine through my windows wake me in the morning or staying up in the wee hours o the night because i just cant stop creating
1832357 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions

1832401 when we went around that tight curve as fast as we were going and we didnt even slide i was impressed
1832402 i see a lot of potential for this program to bring jobs here down the road
1832403 i dont think the other companies are as far along with their vehicles
1832404 they certainly havent put the kind of money into their prototype that lockheed has invested
1832405 i expect lockheed and jwf will be in the downselect and that the military will someday be buying these vehicles from them
1832406 but we also have a very good vehicle and one thats very mature

1832428 tuesday is 2 for 1 p peroni rolls at double daves
1832429 fast whenever it the new crescent is sighted and break the fast when it is seen if it is hidden from you due to cloudiness then complete thirty days for shabaan
1832430 do not fast until you see the crescent and do not end the month of fasting until you see it
1832431 when ramadhaan comes along then fast for thirty days except if you see the hilaal crescent before it
1832432 do not precede ramadhaan by fasting a day or two days before it except for a man whose regular fasting coincides with these days then he can fast
1832433 whoever fasts on the day of doubt the 30th day of shabaan has indeed disobeyed abul qaasim
1832434 fast when it is seen and break the fast when it is seen however if it is cloudy then complete thirty days if two witnesses see it then fast and break the fast
1832435 the people saw the moon so i informed the prophet that i saw it he started to fast and commanded the people to fast also
1832436 whoever does not determine that he will fast before fajr will have no fast that is it would not be accepted
1832437 whoever does not carry the intention at night for fasting will have no fast
1832438 do you have any food if not then i am fasting
1832439 in order for something to be conditional on the legally capable muslim then he must have the abililty to do it
1832440 the messenger of allaah commanded the people to fast the day of aashooraa 10th day of muharram however when ramadhaan was made obligatory then whoever wanted to fast fasted and whoever did not want to did not
1832441 the messenger commanded a man from aslam to inform the people that whoever ate must fast the remainder of the day and whoever did not eat let him fast because this is the day of aashooraa the 10th day of muharram
1832442 when the above aayah was revealed i placed a black rope and a white rope underneath my pillow
1832443 verily that aayah refers to the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the day
1832444 after this aayah was revealed and eat and drink until the black thread becomes distinct from white thread when someone wanted to fast he would tie to his feet a white thread and a black thread and he would continue to eat and drink until he could see them distinctly so allaah revealed after that of the fajr prayer then they became aware that it meant the night and the day
1832445 there are two fajr dawns as for the first it does not prevent eating for the fasting person nor does it permit prayer the fajr prayer as for the other it prohibits eating and allows the prayer
1832446 if the night approaches from hither and the day recedes from there and the sun sets then the fasting person must break his fast
1832447 we were with the messenger on a journey and he was fasting because it was in ramadaan
1832448 get down and prepare the meal of parched barley for us
1832449 o messenger of allaah if you can wait until it becomes evening a little darker
1832450 get down and prepare the meal of parched barley for us
1832451 get down and prepare the meal of parched barley for us
1832452 if you see the night is approaching from this direction it is time for the fasting person to break his fast

1832458 mencionadas por diputados y senadores de la alianza frente al sumario que las autoridades de gendarmer a iniciaron contra un grupo de suboficiales el senador
1832459 reacci n exagerada y en una instituci n como gendarmer a
1832460 creo que en esta materia hay que tener un solo discurso como pa s y tratar de ser coherente entre lo que se dice y lo que se hace y es evidente que gendarmer a es una instituci n jerarquizada est considerado as
1832461 sus normas tiene sus procedimientos y reglamentos internos que no pueden ser pasados a llevar y menos usados desde el punto de vista electoral por parte de un candidato presidencial que se presta para desarrollar su campa a y generando diversos problemas
1832462 el hecho pol tico delicado es otro es el intervencionismo electoral de pi era en una ins tituci n como es gendarmer a sabiendo que es una instituci n respecto de la cual si se pregunta algo se hace institucionalmente como ocurre con carabineros con el ejercito o investigaciones
1832463 rasgar vestiduras ac y venir a decir que hay una ley mordaza o que esto es un matonaje o que no le dejan hablar a su candidato pi era se da todo los gusto que quiera puede hacer y decir lo que se le ocurra si quiere algo va y lo consigue y si no lo consigue o compra
1832464 si tuviera inter s genuino por lo que sucede en la institucionalmente no har a uso pol tico de ella porque el d a de ma ana l tambi n puede reunirse con algunos de los que andan mandando correo en carabineros de chile diciendo me preocup del tema o de alguna situaci n del ej rcito
1832465 son los l mites los que hay que cuidar alguien que est viendo la intervenci n electoral en los dem s tiene que ver la viga en su propio ojo

1832469 the way we look at it there is so much disparity between the rich and the poor right now that we want to take some of that money out of the hands of the greedy and what better place than the denver mint
1832470 the united states mint police do work with the secret service and during that week obviously there will be a lot more security details located in the city but the facility of the united states mint will be protected by the united states mint police and it will be like i said business as usual
1832471 we call ourselves recreate 68 and we want to do a little something to remember abbie hoffman and jerry rubin and the folks that came before us
1832472 and this is kind of our ode to them and also our respect to the poor communities here cause poverty is a killer and we think this is a good way to bring some attention to that issue

1832476 let me say only this much to the moral issue involved suppose germany had developed two bombs before we had any bombs and suppose germany had dropped one bomb say on rochester and the other on buffalo and then having run out of bombs she would have lost the war can anyone doubt that we would then have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime and that we would have sentenced the germans who were guilty of this crime to death at nuremberg and hanged them

1832539 as electricity prices continue to rocket it makes sound economic and environmental sense to replace the geyser with a solar water heater especially in south africa which is blessed with strong sunlight all year round
1832540 a typical solar panel system suitable for a family of four in an average home with an electricity bill averaging r500 per month could cost between r8 000 and r20 000 to install but could produce savings of some r180 per month or r2 100 per year

1832555 schlozman was reshaping the civil rights division schlozman didnt know anything about voting law all he knew is he wanted to be sure that the republicans were going to win
1832556 unsubstantiated or false claims by the loser of a close race mischief and administrative or voter error
1832557 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
1832558 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
1832559 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
1832560 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
1832561 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
1832562 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities
1832563 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
1832564 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
1832565 i am completely unaware that zionism ever aimed to rule the middle east zionism simply wanted to establish and maintain a miniscule jewish state in the land of israel palestine the patrimony of the jews conquered by savage muslim arab invaders

1832568 barbarians who want to take our lives at the moment that society is in the state of being a serial killer it is a very sick society it should be treated the way we treat individuals who are serial killers
1832569 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
1832570 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
1832571 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
1832572 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
1832573 israeli nuclear threat morris has pre determined the result israel will have to engage in a genocidal nuclear assault on iran
1832574 if his conviction stands the enron prosecutions were a success if it doesnt prosecutors will have a hard time convincing the public that they took the right approach
1832575 but its clear that the law is evolving in this area
1832576 whenever a court rules as the 5th circuit did regarding this issue we listen to that ruling
1832577 to be clear we vigorously oppose the defendants every accusation of prosecutorial misconduct

1832579 convictions a prosecutors battle against mafia killers drug kingpins and enron thieves
1832580 the enron business records were so voluminous and hard to decode we thought it could take years to determine what evidence was relevant
1832581 it would take the six of us more than a decade
1832582 we tried as hard as we could to do a thoughtful and conscientious job in a very difficult case

1832585 theyre trying to avoid being attacked for what some may call the excesses of the enron and other earlier corporate fraud matters
1832586 the government was very aggressive and they may have gone too far in their prosecution theories
1832587 now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1832588 white house fabricated this letter and paid habbush 5 million to stay quiet
1832589 more concerned with threats from regional enemies like iran than a us invasion
1832590 the report stated that according to habbush saddam had ended his nuclear program in 1991 the same year he destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile iraq had no intention habbush said of restarting either program
1832591 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1832592 everyone was terrified that habbush would pop up on the screen
1832593 that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1832594 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

1832663 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1832664 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1832665 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1832666 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1832667 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee

1832700 they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found

1832716 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not

1832718 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1832719 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good

1832736 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1832737 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1832738 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1832739 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1832740 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1832741 he is very gifted very fast and he kind of just fits in hes such a gifted musician and rob spent a lot of time being the third wheel in the lars james songwriting process and he just adapted to it super quickly and was great to bounce ideas off of and to come up with a great suggestion when me or james would get stuck he was right in there with us its been incredibly positive to have him around in the creative process the way we all connect with each other and the way we connect with our fans

1832752 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1832753 tendered his resignation after he and the obama campaign received emailed inquiries about his background from the wall street journal
1832754 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1832755 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1832756 a message left for mr said at the mosque was not returned

1832773 fetisov should have known everything he should have been informed warned of any kind of violations we saw nothing of the kind
1832774 he represented us and then said before the olympics i did everything what did you do you betrayed the country and took a month long pre olympic vacation somewhere in your native america
1832775 these comments directed at fetisov are made by people who have no idea what goes on in international organisations
1832776 they are allowing themselves on the eve of the olympics to tear up russias sporting reputation instead of defending it
1832777 i will remind you that in the last three olympic games our team has won 243 medals
1832778 we believe that in beijing we will be able not only to repeat but to exceed this success
1832779 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1832780 when in the united states they discovered the balco laboratories it was sad but they didnt say that the whole of u s sport was involved in doping
1832781 these results were known ages ago but they decided to release them just before the olympic games
1832782 there is a feeling that they officials did it especially to create unpleasantness for us
1832783 no one is excusing the athletes who broke the wada world anti doping agency code
1832784 there has to be some kind of weapon that will frighten those who dont have enough dignity to stop and for whom material profit is more powerful than moral gain
1832785 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1832786 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1832787 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1832788 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1832789 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1832790 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1832791 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1832792 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1832793 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it

1832834 ms winfrey ahd the good sense to sample briefly the theology at trinity united church and fled from it and reverend wright she showed good judgment there why did obama stay so long what was the appeal
1832835 also there should be a study of the obama effect my understanding is that it has been reported that oprahs ratings have declined measurably since her endorsement of senator obama
1832836 first ma and now ny big declines in leads for obama movement in ny seems to be to undecided
1832837 you would like to think the culture wars are over but they are not my freinds they are not
1832838 obama has never run a business and has no foreign policy credentials in this day the only near independent role of the executive is foreign policy
1832839 by the way going to school is an academic accomplishment nothing else

1832863 now the mccain campaign wants to create a dramatically different narrative
1832864 they want you to see him as a man who went to fancy schools who has had the beneficiary of an elite life and is increasingly removed from the mainstream of normal american life
1832865 and now the mccain campaign wants to turn obamas strength into a weakness and make him seem like a celebrity who has nothing to offer but high blown words
1832866 hes obviously not in the same league as britney spears or paris hilton theyve gone way too far with that but weve seen where strategies that have been derided by commentators have been effective with voters
1832867 but hes not an elitist thats not a sustained campaign tactic here was someone who grew up with nothing versus the son of four star admirals its a nice try and a good diversion in the first part of august but painting him as an elitist is not a winning strategy going into the fall

1832934 people underestimate the role conversation plays in developing language in helping children be able to make connections and get more meaning from a text they may be reading were seeing this show up in more and more of the research
1832935 youre looking for a deeper level of thought than just the rote concepts of everyday life and in summer we have a real opportunity to do this just sitting around the kitchen table

1832937 and why chocolate cereal might not be the best choice
1832938 schools are all about helping students set their own goals and assess themselves and develop the self assurance to grow into citizens who are equipped to make decisions in a world we cant really imagine yet
1832939 so to include kids in the conversation about how they can succeed in the coming year actually honours the fact that theyre the ones who are the learners
1832940 commitment on the part of the western nations to a particular set of cultural symbols the factory the industrial complex the technological innovation
1832941 the message came over loud and clear these countries were into the business of making money
1832942 once again i was powerfully struck by a question that has stayed with me is the church to sit on the margins of the world offering a salvation that is an escape which seems to leave the world to go its own way
1832943 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
1832944 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
1832945 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
1832946 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
1832947 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
1832948 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
1832949 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
1832950 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
1832951 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
1832952 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
1832953 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
1832954 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate

1832963 wait when exactly did you talk to naomi about all this again
1832964 i do not agree with the sentiment or content of the offensive material
1832965 i apologize to everyone who was offended and humbly ask for your forgiveness
1832966 a process of firm and severe discipline with our son
1832967 my reaction is this is very shocking and disheartening that there are people who harbor these views or feelings
1832968 i thought the country had come a long way in the area of race relations and inclusion of background including in politics and society as a whole
1832969 on the other hand im not totally shocked because the country has a long history of racial issues which have not completely been wiped out
1832970 i think its certainly the right thing to do to apologize but in my mind the question is how sincere is his apology
1832971 its maybe an act of expediency because his dad is running for a high profile political office
1832972 its shocking and its deplorable its an erosion of civility
1832973 there was a time when people who held these types of viewpoints didnt speak up so much but for some reason people are becoming more comfortable making these types of statements
1832974 im glad he took it down but its deplorable it was up there in the first place the impact is shock disbelief anger hurt whether its intentional or not
1832975 the offensive materials directly contradict the values that my parents taught me and are forbidden in my parents home
1832976 coups are not caused by political parties but by people with evil intentions to cause treason
1832977 they are caused by power hungry people with no jobs but try to get power through illegal means
1832978 as long as there are these kind of people around there will always be a possibility of coups
1832979 we already have a common name its just that it has not been promoted and marketed both overseas and locally and thats what the interim government should do
1832980 citizens in the solomons are known as solomon islanders so are the cook islanders and the new zealanders so why cant we be recognised as fiji islanders

1833017 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person

1833024 tax reform is desperately needed in the united states but before we can reform the tax code we must sharply reduce the tax burden on americans made necessary second we need a tax code that makes taxation fairer and simpler for all citizens meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending
1833025 i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
1833026 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic

1833092 it doesnt make sense to use this deeply flawed system

1833110 its been alleged that the accused fraudulently placed advertisements on line selling vintage vehicles on ebay

1833124 we made a good effort today of recording our first demo in apollo studios we started at 5 pm but didnt start recording till 9 because we had to get a good sound set up miking drums amps getting a good sound for the guitars surprisingly dutch diva the song we are loath to play since we know it so well and everyone keeps requesting it turned out to be the most difficult to record we spent 3 hours on it or thereabouts i guess we had to get warmed up and the solo was tricky to get right i ended up recording it in 3 parts given the nature of it and time constraints then we got vampire bitches done in 3 takes that was weird there is one wrong note in the finger tapping bit for the solo to that song but its hardly noticeable as a mistake i over dubbed the solo aswell to get a cool sound we left at around 2 am and negotiated temple bar without getting stabbed

1833145 the drying device known as a lyophilizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1833146 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1833147 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
1833148 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual

1833204 illegal immigration is a huge problem in the united states that will only worsen if we continue to play games instead of getting serious about real reform
1833205 border fences are expensive distractions paid for by taxpayers from addressing the causes of illegal immigration
1833206 building a fence wont fix these problems that are at the heart of why people come to this country illegally
1833207 people are breaking the law and entering illegally because it is easier to swim the rio grande than to climb the mountain of paperwork
1833208 the solution to defending our border and sovereignty must make it easier for peaceful people to enter the country legally
1833209 we understand that we must have a secure border and keep out those who present a threat to national health or security
1833210 immigration policy should be a realistic reflection of our society
1833211 too much regulation hurts our economy by limiting the pool of cheap labor and creates incentives to enter the country illegally too little leaves the united states open to harm immigration reform should balance the needs of our economy with the need for domestic security a border fence does not fully address this need

1833230 if i could turn into a girl the first thing id do is get dped
1833231 you god damn right i would id suck his balls id suck them dry
1833232 you neednt try so hard because you cant win the banner anyway
1833233 look at this plot i wonder whose it is theyve hardly dug anything yet they must be at home fast asleep
1833234 perhaps someone has gone and changed the markers for a lark
1833235 no all the other numbers are right heres no 11 and theres no 13 on the other side
1833236 if this is our plot whats that stump doing there we pulled it out didnt we
1833237 a new one couldnt have grown in its place overnight
1833238 look fellows a real miracle there was a big stump here yesterday and now its gone where could it be
1833239 you know what it was their plot we dug up last night and that stump we pulled out was theirs too
1833240 what shall we do now by rights they ought to give us their plot and take ours all that work done for nothing
1833241 you dont want us to be the laughing stock of the whole camp do you
1833242 someone pulled that stump out for them they said so themselves
1833243 suppose someone wanted it for fire wood thats their look out not ours
1833244 if they had it would be lying about here somewhere
1833245 if you do your planting and weeding well well take the scarecrow off your plot
1833246 lets award it to the team that makes the worst showing with the rest of the work
1833247 and in the autumn well present it to the team with the worst crop
1833248 they were behind everybody else all the time and they got the biggest crop hows that
1833249 its perfectly fair they may have been slower than all the rest of you but they worked the soil thoroughly and they tried hard
1833250 they had a good bit of land thats what it is me and senka got a bad plot thats why we have a poor harvest although we worked hard too and they can keep their old scarecrow they had it all summer
1833251 if it wasnt for that scarecrow we wouldnt have won the banner
1833252 because it drove the crows away from our plot and thats why we have the biggest harvest besides it reminded us all the time that we had to work hard
1833253 what are we going to do with that silly old scarecrow
1833254 oui mais jaimais bien le c t rock nroll de too fast for love moi dans ta tronche daccord mais vince neil il me faisait ressentir des choses toutes bizarres avec sa voix dans ta tronche oui monsieur mais que la musique est lourde sur ce disque alors que paf okay vai compris fest un difque dans ta tronfe in your fafe comme on dit dans le vargon
1833255 well win it at the start and we wont let go of it all summer and itll go back to town with us
1833256 well go ahead and dig it up if you need help the others will lend you a hand
1833257 if you dont get to work well soon be way behind the others
1833258 that will be enough for one day well only work in the mornings after dinner well rest otherwise some of you chaps will overdo it the first day and wont be able to work the rest of the time
1833259 because im doing the digging all you do is measure
1833260 how was i to know it was half a mile long
1833261 im that kind of a person if i start something ive got to see it through
1833262 six and a half metres now if you hadnt cut it off it might have been twenty metres
1833263 if id known you were going to dawdle about instead of working id never have hitched up with you
1833264 go ahead and work by yourself if you like im not forcing you to work with me
1833265 after ive dug up most of the plot already nothing doing but we certainly wont be the first to finish
1833266 who says we wont look at vanya lozhkin and senya bobrov theyve dug even less than we have
1833267 some diggers well have to lend you a hand pretty soon
1833268 youd better get to work or well be lending you a hand
1833269 youre a fine one making fun of others when youve done hardly anything yourself im sorry i hitched up with you
1833270 ive thought up a wonderful idea tomorrow well have the banner on our plot youll see
1833271 theres a good two days work to be done on this plot and itll be four days if you carry on like this
1833272 all right but do get to work now the ground wont dig itself
1833273 heres my plan tonight when everyone is asleep well go and dig up our whole plot all except a little bit which we can easily finish tomorrow were sure to win the banner then
1833274 but you keep fussing with all sorts of silly nonsense
1833275 wed better get started or well have to kiss that banner good bye
1833276 this is our plot i can tell by the stump sticking up in the middle

1833278 the continual amount of oil in north dakota is three times as much as texas were doing as much as we can to try and get it out
1833279 the helicopter was left inverted in the river and kitsault is known as being a very fast moving river which increases the difficulties when youre trying to get into that
1833280 it was quite a remote area and weather was a factor so we were concerned about getting resources there in a timely manner
1833281 this has everything we need including a parking lot and rest rooms
1833282 we walked through the dayton gym club for the first time on july 4 and knew right away it had everything

1833285 without subsidies how many projects now under way regarding wind would make economic sense
1833286 everyone has treated us very well the venues have been nice we trained at the stadium yesterday its beautiful unbelievable it holds 60 000 and the game is sold out tomorrow its going to be a great atmosphere
1833287 for me obviously this is a chance of a lifetime to be part of the olympics especially for myself im one of the overage players guzan is one of the teams overage players in the under 23 tournament having had missed the cutoff by a couple of months i wasnt sure if i was going to be a part of it but the opportunity presented itself
1833288 there were a lot of things that happened in talks between villa and u s soccer about the possibility of me going or not going
1833289 we all agree to go ahead with it and it all worked out for me i was granted a work permit for britain last week and im able to participate in the olympics

1833299 the gospel puts the glory of god first and the salvation of man second
1833300 conversion for those first christians was not a destination but it was the beginning of a journey
1833301 what we think about when we are free to think about what we will that is what we are or will soon become
1833302 those who regard vain idols forsake their faithfulness but i will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving that which i have vowed i will pay salvation is from the lord
1833303 are you running from gods call on your life have you hired a luxury ship to take you to a comfort zone where you dont have to think about the needs of your nineveh
1833304 our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream
1833305 weve always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own our people are losing that faith not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy
1833306 in little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof
1833307 back then we imported about a third of our oil now we import more than half
1833308 will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the worlds oil wells
1833309 our excessive dependence on opec has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people
1833310 these efforts will cost money a lot of money and that is why congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay it will be money well spent unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil these funds will be paid by americans to americans
1833311 i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now
1833312 in just ten years these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east
1833313 i am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one half by the end of the next decade
1833314 think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents
1833315 just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win world war ii so will we mobilize american determination and ability to win the energy war
1833316 ill also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power solar power and geothermal energy
1833317 i am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nations history to develop americas own alternative sources of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant products for gasohol from unconventional gas from the sun
1833318 think about when the scientists and engineers told john f kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon he told them they would find a way
1833319 we ourselves are the same americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon
1833320 we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 percent more efficient over the next four years
1833321 im asking congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that our nations utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels especially coal our most abundant energy source
1833322 and well invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal americas most abundant energy source
1833323 i will do my best but i will not do it alone let your voice be heard whenever you have a chance say something good about our country

1833336 at age seven i realized there was a big difference between my life and theirs
1833337 i was beginning to wonder about suffering and why the world was neither fair nor just
1833338 going abroad and seeing other cultures really jolts people that way
1833339 they see how many things impact health such as access to clean water food education and social support i know that my work in uganda has helped me to be a better doctor in belleville because im more attuned to peoples lives in the context of their families and their communities
1833340 im more attuned to prevention health behaviors end of life care its essential to see people as part of a network
1833341 when i went to medical school i knew i wanted to do something international
1833342 i felt strongly that our family should live and work abroad together
1833343 my job was to see how a doctor could improve the quality and delivery of health services
1833344 he said you are the most educated person who has ever visited our village and thank you for coming to train the village health workers
1833345 but the problem is that we dont have access to clean water
1833346 we can serve as advocates bring visibility and champion a cause
1833347 early on josiah mafigiri the ugandan clinic administrator told me you cannot treat patients on your own
1833348 many of the students come from small towns in wisconsin and have never been out of the country before
1833349 this year we took one who had never been on a plane
1833350 once students return they see healthcare in an entirely new light
1833351 it gives them the mindset of caring for populations instead of individuals here we train doctors to take care of patients one at a time but public health has a different approach it teaches health workers to consider the patients entire network

1833367 the nice thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every cell type in the body the difficult thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every type of cell in the body
1833368 and so when you push them to specialize they tend to make different cell types were trying to control that process and identify the genes that get the cells down a pathway and then hold them at the start
1833369 our goal is to recreate what happens in the embryo but in the dish
1833370 and so for us this is truly a step forward in understanding what genes can control cell fate and use them to make clinically relevant tissue
1833371 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury

1833393 the salaries dont keep up with the cost of paying off the debt so youre in your 40s still paying off your debt at a time when you have to save for your kids

1833395 we left corporate america which is a lot of what were asking young people to do

1833402 a world where federal laws dont discriminate against same sex relationships
1833403 that is why he has said the federal government should not stand in the way of states that want to decide for themselves how best to pursue equality for gay and lesbian couples whether that means a domestic partnership a civil union or a civil marriage

1833410 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
1833411 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1833412 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1833413 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities

1833452 the time for action is now in fact it is past due pelosi and hoyer sent the congress on vacation while families are cancelling their vacations because of high gas prices
1833453 i call on david boswell to join me in signing a petition to let the democrat congressional leadership know that people and businesses are hurting and that kentuckians need and expect action to lower prices immediately
1833454 we the undersigned believe that gas prices are too high speaker pelosi has closed congress for a five week paid vacation without taking any action to lower gas prices we the undersigned have a simple demand call congress back madam speaker
1833455 the liberal congressional leadership is apparently beholden to the fringe element in their party that opposes expanded oil production in the united states it is time to put partisanship aside and allow a vote on a bill that offers a comprehensive solution including more domestic drilling greater conservation measures and investment in new technology

1833467 the agencies of course discourage share buy backs but we still have some commodity volatility we have our ongoing capex program thats got a little more than a year to kind of run out were kind of at the peak spending period as we stand here and we see some good m amp a opportunities out there that were evaluating each and every day
1833468 were already blending over the mandate right now ethanol is a lot cheaper than unleaded gasoline so everybody is going to be trying to expand and blend as much as they can so even if there is a waiver which really doesnt make much sense we still do not see the ethanol demand slowing down at all just because it is very price competitive
1833469 in terms of picking up demand the incremental supply thats scheduled to come online over say the next 12 months
1833470 yes we keep seeing new markets come in and as ethanol is 0 60 to 1 under unleaded gasoline more and more people keep blending it and using it
1833471 there is a lot of talk about the tariffs but logistically brazil is just not set up to handle and ship any more ethanol than they already are i mean we have the infrastructure issues we are very involved in the brazil infrastructure probably over the long term that can change but it also comes down to just a revenue issue doing away with the tariff its just less revenue in the united states because x amount of gallons will come to the united states one way or the other
1833472 cash flow and current deferred revenue results again missed our expectations and managements outlook for the september quarter fell below our previous revenue and eps estimates
1833473 while were definite fans of the differentiated service offering and large opportunity were also cognizant that premium valuations could be tougher to justify without clearer evidence of accelerating trends
1833474 the relatively in line q2 and guidance are not enough to entice and although overall activity levels appear to be ramping were also concerned that sales cycles are lengthening likely attributable to larger deals and a tougher selling environment
1833475 we continue to believe that the pace of new customer activity has slowed for netsuite due to softer macroeconomic conditions

1833488 at one world cross country championship i can confidently say that of six of us in the great britain junior womens team four had some form of eating disorder
1833489 it is so common in the sport yet no coach or team manager ever expressed concern i was never told that i was too thin and was never withdrawn from a race because of my weight
1833490 outside of sport people would think i ate too little and exercised too much but within athletics my behaviour was not only accepted but endorsed and encouraged
1833491 there were lots of others like me so it was easy to hide
1833492 i was so weak and undernourished that i didnt have the energy to sprint for the line

1833497 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the lineage of pharaohs
1833498 in a soft market the temptation is often to discount heavily and not look closely at what you are getting out of your rooms
1833499 at trump we carefully consider our pricing and products together
1833500 historically cash guests were not regarded as very important to the atlantic city gaming industry
1833501 cash guests are increasingly attractive because they appreciate everything our properties offer they enjoy the shows shopping and our restaurants and clubs growing this segment is one strategy helping us in the softer market this also dovetails with atlantic citys program to market itself as a destination offering more than gaming
1833502 we manage our availability and set rates based on total guest value not just room rate so the right guests always have a room at our properties
1833503 adding these rooms in a soft market has created an opportunity for us to fill the void
1833504 to drive more business we aggressively stepped up marketing efforts and were successful with tv and print media promotions geared toward non gaming customers
1833505 the rainmaker software helps us forecast our cash customer demand independently from our casino business so we can say on any given day what our booking pace is and what our demand appears to be for our cash customers
1833506 we were compiling a considerable amount of data manually to make determinations about forecasted customer demand by customer worth
1833507 our old method of data gathering and forecasting was outdated now we are receiving that information automatically and are able to identify current customer trends more quickly these trends are subsequently compared to year over year performance by calendar date the resulting data enables us to perform accurate forecast modeling to effectively set rates and availability by customer value thus laying the groundwork for revenue optimization of the resort

1833776 since the peak of 147 a barrel we yesterday dropped to under 120 for the first time in a while
1833777 today wednesday its at 118 45 meaning its dropped nearly 30 in a couple weeks right now were seeing a national average of 3 86 for a gallon of regular the national average is down 25 cents since the all time high of 4 11 on july 17
1833778 when we announced we are going to start drilling the market started coming down
1833779 it has dropped substantially every day were down 40 cents a gallon in the past few weeks i hope it continues but no one knows for sure i hope when it gets to a reasonable rate that it stays that way for the winter
1833780 last year we locked in at 2 45 a gallon
1833781 it was a great year to lock in this year its substantially higher so if youre locked in and the rate goes down youll lose money
1833782 it might be in the range of 4 49 to 4 69 depending on what the market is at that time its the same as gas it changes every day
1833783 we were pleased to see prices dropping but whether that turns out to be temporary or continues remains to be seen
1833784 the drop in wholesale prices for barrels of oil has not yet translated into home heating fuel dramatically so were not ready to say it translates into good news for homeowners
1833785 theres a lot of speculation going on its not just supply and demand speculators are trying to figure out future prices there are some signals like the growth in china which is seeming to slow down from double digits but the trends will go up and down hopefully the trend is toward flattening if not a slight decline yet it could still go significantly higher which is not positive i wouldnt read too much in the drop
1833786 its making it easier for them because they know what to expect every month and if the price goes down the payment goes down
1833787 we have to keep in mind if we continue to see the price retreat as it has and if we see domestic demand continue to decline it might go lower
1833788 if we see relative inactivity as far as the hurricane season in the gulf region that has an impact weve had two smaller storms dolly and edouard so far if the economy remains stable and the goepolitical tension in the mid east remains calm well see a change well see if it hits 3 75 by the end of august going into the labor day travel season

1833792 i tried to forget the race at budapest but thats quite difficult
1833793 i spoke about it a lot with my engineers before the race i knew that i could have a good start thanks to the starting system of the car i expected to pass
1833794 from then on i drove with very good rhythm i think you can count the laps lewis was faster than me on one hand
1833795 but in the end it was not my day when the engine failed i had a strange feeling it was like a nightmare and i wanted to wake up but i couldnt because i was already awake it was an incredible disappointment this sport can be really cruel
1833796 looking at the standings at least i can stay calm because not even lewis won but we cant throw away points like that

1834212 this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1834213 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework
1834214 its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
1834215 and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3 000 americans

1834237 seem ed to be something of an endorsement of the idea of reparations for slavery which is usually taken to mean cash payments

1834358 participei da promo o wall e dia dos namorados do ig clube e no regulamento da promo o diz que o resultado com os nomes dos contemplados seria divulgados no dia 14 07 08 no site do ig clube at agora n o tem resultado da promo o gostaria de saber quem foram os contemplados mandei um email para o sac do site e at agora n o obtive uma resposta ou esclarecimento sobre o ocorrido estou decepcionada com o ig a primeira promo o que eu participo e ocorre isso acho uma grande falta de considera o com as pessoas que participaram da promo o que dispuseram de uma parte do seu tempo pra pensar e de forma criativa criar uma boa frase para tentar ser um dos contemplados solicito por favor uma resposta um esclarecimento n o sei mais a quem recorrer sobre o assunto
1834359 os pr mios foram enviados aos ganhadores no prazo prometido por m houve uma falha em nosso sistema de divulga o e por isso o atraso na disponibiliza o da lista de ganhadores a situa o foi regularizada sentimos pelo transtorno
1834360 do i want to work for a web design company again no seo has to be 1 no more designers programmers managers clients to stand in the way of seo i felt that rule 1 should be seo and everything else should fall around or behind that
1834361 i feel lucky and have big dreams and were up to 40 now
1834362 when you grow changes are going to happen and not all changes are always going to work as you thought
1834363 it looks like what they did to hatfill ivins was the weirdest one
1834364 he was absolutely shocked they were going after him like this
1834365 oh yeah this thing has had constant use up to the point that it broke and they gave up on it
1834366 an obnoxious laugh swearing like a sailor bad breath breaking wind getting blackout drunk talking about your exes its a long list
1834367 some guys really dig love handles your issues seem to be more about you than your boyfriend it sounds like you should hit the gym not for your body or your boyfriend but for your mind
1834368 i believe we all have a handful of soulmates the most important thing to me is someone who makes me laugh i know thats cheesy but really its not as complicated as you think
1834369 you cant please everyone as long as youre having fun in the meantime it will happen i try to get to know the girls im attracted to without having an official date i keep it light become their best friend and hold off on the romance if youre friends first the rest of it happens more naturally
1834370 we used over 5 000 still pictures often layered over each other at variable rates of speed
1834371 our frame rates are so quick im not sure it still counts as stop motion
1834372 the offer to top rank for the williams margarito rematch is quite simple
1834373 when margarito said he wanted a rematch right after our fight on july 14th i said i was happy to give him one so of course id be just as happy to give him a rematch in november
1834374 his promoter knows that if me and margarito get in the ring again i would win they know i know how to fight him and im as tough of course he has a chance to upset me but the chance is slim
1834375 im sure margaritos fans want to see him redeem himself against williams
1834376 and i know fans of paul williams want to see him put margarito in his place again while unifying the wbo and wba welterweight titles
1834377 for this fight its winner take all in my eyes our sport thrives with compelling fights and its hard to imagine that their second fight would be better than the first but i believe it would break all records for actual number of big time punches thrown in a fight
1834378 im top heavy so its easy for me to get down to 147 when i start training i walk around about 160 so i can go up and down between 147 and 168
1834379 i just want to fight i want to fight people who are on the same level with me or on a higher level than me in their mind thats what boxing is all about risk my fans always tell me they love that about me
1834380 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1834381 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1834382 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1834383 thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists
1834384 in five short months the bush administration will be done
1834385 you should read it instead of that newspaper newspapers are so negative this is positive
1834386 but you see i need to read this i am a journalist
1834387 oh well this is about positive positive thought the secret to everything
1834388 if youre under 40 that was a long time ago man
1834389 when i first moved to nashville i was better at piano than anything
1834390 i quit though because a guitar was just so much easier to play and write songs with
1834391 todo el mundo sabe lo que cuesta un dvd y que un guionista obtiene entre cuatro a cinco centavos por la venta del dvd
1834392 lo que estamos pidiendo son ocho centavos y ellos dicen que eso es vergonzoso
1834393 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
1834394 the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans
1834395 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
1834396 please i need money im hungry i need to eat
1834397 artists can be targets for these kinds of suits and we defend every one vigorously
1834398 i have a friend i like like that and i don
1834399 im about ready to take that key away from rowdy
1834400 anyone ever tell you that you look just like duane johnson
1834401 whatever bad incentives the implicit federal guarantee creates have been offset by the fact that fannie and freddie were and are tightly regulated with regard to the risks they can take you could say that the fannie freddie experience shows that regulation works in that case however how did they end up in trouble part of the answer is the sheer scale of the housing bubble and the size of the price declines taking place now that the bubble has burst in los angeles miami and other places anyone who borrowed to buy a house at the peak of the market probably has negative equity at this point even if he or she originally put 20 percent down the result is a rising rate of delinquency even on loans that meet fannie freddie guidelines also fannie and freddie while tightly regulated in terms of their lending havent been required to put up enough capital that is money raised by selling stock rather than borrowing this means that even a small decline in the value of their assets can leave them underwater owing more than they own
1834402 still isnt it shocking that taxpayers may end up having to rescue these institutions not really were going through a major financial crisis and such crises almost always end with some kind of taxpayer bailout for the banking system
1834403 one of the most naive notions is that politicians are trying to solve the countrys problems just because they say so or say so loudly or inspiringly
1834404 todo estar a perdido si un mismo hombre tuviese el ejercicio de las tres potestades la de hacer las leyes la de ejecutar las resoluciones p blicas y la de juzgar los delitos o las diferencias de los particulares

1834407 it says right in the introduction that its dedicated to his family
1834408 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book
1834409 i t is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
1834410 if youll read carefully what media matters said they point out there is no dedication page even in the second edition
1834411 and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
1834412 obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather
1834413 m issing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
1834414 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack sr or to his indonesian stepfather
1834415 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
1834416 while the deep exploration objective in the kingfisher 2 well at this location did not find additional hydrocarbons this well has proved a significant discovery
1834417 that move was very unfortunate i see this as another way of forming an opposition movement which is bound to kill the germinating seeds of multiparty democracy in uganda
1834418 we still have three years i think leaders of the opposition parties should be very careful not to take steps that will nip in the bud the flourishing of multiparty democracy by reducing their focus to the removal of a regime other than building structures and systems
1834419 no single party in uganda is a party in the sense of an organised institution prepared to provide alternative leadership this is unfortunate because many of us clamoured for opening up political space to allow competition for leadership by political parties not individuals
1834420 they have 15m over sh24b purportedly to support democratisation in uganda dormant parties like jeema and cp are trying to cash in and get some money we are also very aware that there is a conspiracy by international groups against the nrm it is a game we have been at and we are ready for them
1834421 they fielded aggrey awori in 2001 to deny nrm eastern votes and chapaa karuhanga to deny nrm the western votes and jeema to deny us the muslim and buganda votes but they failed
1834422 we decided to call it off because the people were not mobilised
1834423 you know all the problems are originating from rubaga the local people are not happy about what happened in the party and we may not receive a good reception in the area
1834424 i am not talking to the press now i need to meet my boss besigye either today or tomorrow then i will come out clearly
1834425 when i wave the v sign of the party most of them reply although deep in their hearts they are supporting other parties
1834426 but when you support the party you should mean it be courageous this is when we shall manage to defeat museveni
1834427 he started complaining of feeling sick at bujuku before elena hut we advised him to go back but he refused saying he would be okay
1834428 we had received information that debrisson was sick and we sent a rescue team and a doctor to help him move down unfortunately he died shortly after the team reached him
1834429 we must do something to appease the spirits of the mountain
1834430 we have moved far but we want to continue higher the basiita want you to hold the banner for the fourth term
1834431 the people of sironko have asked me to ask you to stand for the fourth term come 2011 i dont want to meander
1834432 twenty two years ago we had hope that hope has turned into reality there is universal secondary education and universal primary education abundance of commodities freedom of movement and security i definitely support you for a fourth term
1834433 however i changed my mind because when you see someone in a uniform in a lodge you know he or she is a student
1834434 direct flat and uses pedestrian pathways when we know about them
1834435 just placing a crime event on a map does not necessarily give us insight into the story as the beyond broadcast panelist lee banville editor in chief of the
1834436 one question i like to ask myself is would my site succeed without maps
1834437 leslie goes on to suggest that the answer lies in the increased use of a gis is connecting data to maps but the difference is both in quantity and quality of data as well as intention the intent is for analysis not a superficial look
1834438 its hard impossible to know the intent of software while i know some of the reasons some products were built or applications developed or implementations completed thats about what people do with it
1834439 nas is the only mc of my generation maybe rakim but he was the generation before me nas was the most respected mc in every genre of rap n a he could do a song with puffy or wu tang
1834440 he had one of the biggest songs of the summer if anything hes helping keep it alive you dont have to be lil wayne in order for people to say your sh is fresh
1834441 be accepting of different people let people be who they are
1834442 you know how many people came at me calling me gay cause i wear my jeans the fresh way
1834443 or cause i said hey dude how yall gonna say f right in front of a gay dudes face and act like thats ok that sh is disrespectful
1834444 it took me time to break out of the mental prisons i was in
1834445 the stereotypes of the fear of the backlash that i would get for believing in what i believe in for accepting people for who they are
1834446 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
1834447 youre polish you like football and you read more books than i do will you marry me
1834448 if you havent read it go to your nearest library and get it youll be glad you did
1834449 it was a river that i could not cross for the water was too deep water in which one must swim a river that could not be crossed
1834450 the spirit searches all things yes the deep things of god
1834451 those who are sown on good ground those who hear the word of god and accept it and bear fruit some 30 fold some 60 and some a 100 mark 4 20
1834452 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ
1834453 my people have been lost sheep their shepherds have led them astray
1834454 you outwardly appear righteous to men but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
1834455 if you abide in my word you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free
1834456 che noia devo anche fingere per tre giorni se no questi babbani non mi credono potessi almeno aggiustarmi il trucco
1834457 lets get out of here and go and see the dark knight
1834458 and that means you can come into my house in the early hours of the morning unannounced and and whatever that was
1834459 i always thought that you and i well that we had something ya know
1834460 yeah colonel samantha carter beautiful woman we have worked with for years the one you have been drooling over and has been drooling over you
1834461 to kiss her to do all those things regulations prevented you doing
1834462 trying to do all those things regulations prevented my doing
1834463 youre still a general you will always be a general the scandal
1834464 you still have to work at a military base youll be in danger
1834465 did you think to get condoms lube the practical things or just that you were retired and free of regulations
1834466 there is no such thing as the best of circumstances jack
1834467 trying to kill me you know im allergic to flowers still ill have to play sam wont i
1834468 yeah you know you top me bottom it wont do to have you in pain our first time together
1834469 yeah you really havent thought this through jack it takes a little while to get used to the first time hurts as much as you want it as much as you might be screaming with pleasure from it the first time hurts cause the arse wasnt really designed for it youll be tight probably too tight we should start slow get you used to the idea of penetration
1834470 yeah i like it both ways jack you start this you have to to take it as well as give it
1834471 im not military jack i dont have regulations to stop me and it is none of your damn business who ive been fucking

1834473 im a single attractive guy with enough spare income to generally do what i want
1834474 i rarely got lonely when i was stuck in the infirmary overnight
1834475 janet was often the first in line janet and i were good for each other we never wanted to take it home never wanted it to go any further there were never any complications with janet
1834476 i couldnt have what i wanted but to hell with pining away like sam ive never been a risk free person jack and i have never shirked from a risk you should know me that well by now
1834477 yes you do you just ignored anything that you didnt want to see like the fact that i was an adult when we met i didnt understand the military then but that changed pretty quickly i just had to learn to use the ridged military ways to my own advantage you assumed my ignorance of the military was ignorance of life
1834478 so if you want to go wake sam up if you think you have made a mistake it would be easier on us both if you left now ans we will both ignore this
1834479 well you were right to start with we do have something dont we i want that and dont give me any of that romantic rubbish we are two guys jack mostly what is on our minds right now is whether or not we are going to use the supplies you thought to bring with you
1834480 not so fast jack i might not be wanting to hear the romantic stuff right now but if you are going to be stuffing your cock up my arse then there are a few things you need to learn about necessary foreplay between guys
1834481 you can look all you want jack but lose the clothes give me something to look at
1834482 shouldnt we be talking about this going on a date something
1834483 you were the one who turned up in the middle of the night with condoms
1834484 secondly we have shit up our arses jack no matter how we clean ourselves out that is where our shit comes from
1834485 with you yes you tend to negelect certain points of practicallity for the romance of the situation
1834486 youre the one who ended up 100 years old in a matter of days cause a pretty woman gave you cake
1834487 no i am going to give you the best fuck you have ever had in your entire life

1834510 is digital journalism better the more local it is and what does that do to growth
1834511 one problem with ms shashas argument is that she presupposes that everyone actually had a sense of direction in the first place lots of people my wife included dont
1834512 i couldnt believe it i just dont understand whats going on in this world today they cant cover everything thats going on its a bad situation i dont know what the world is coming to the the two little kids is left without a daddy now its a bad situation i dont know what the world is coming to with it being like this
1834513 you just never know from one day to the next especially with two little kids theyre very nice people
1834514 great young talent is a couple years away from blossoming
1834515 delete the old cache files which are located at your netbeanss configuration directory
1834516 i had a day when my sugar was out of range and i sat down at the piano and wrote it in 20 minutes
1834517 and it was because i had this strong inspiration a lot of people have told me its inspiring
1834518 for me my vision has always been to be a positive light
1834519 at the end of the day the things that stick out are when kids say thank you those are my simple wins
1834520 my advice is that its ok to rely on other people and be positive because it will be ok
1834521 just recently at a concert nick had a low onstage
1834522 nick said i need a few seconds to stall so i just kept talking i kept looking for a sign and so they ended up making fun of me it went on for like five minutes but really i think its great that we have that support system onstage
1834523 a collaboration with bret michaels would be different for us
1834524 i havent met halle berry yet but im open for a meeting anytime
1834525 i dont even know what this line is for i just got in it because everyone else is
1834526 that which has real being and that which is only a quality
1834527 fills one may say every man with puzzlement and perplexity
1834528 must be learnt by complete and long and continuous study of the true and the false about all that has real being
1834529 after much effort as names definitions sights and other data of sense are brought into contact and friction one with another in the course of scrutiny and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill will with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of human powers
1834530 our ancestors who formerly maintained these places loved wisdom and through it they obtained wealth and passed it on to us
1834531 another possible explanation for the observed association might be the lack of attention given to a child by mothers who are frequent users of cell phones
1834532 by that i mean that suddenly all the creativity that had previously gone into creating stuff like the tour de france or the lyons coffee house record label or the radio soap ma perkins now went into traditional mass advertising
1834533 dynomite part 1 by tony camillos bazuka peaked at number 10 on the pop chart

1834536 you know i bet well be amazed when we get up to heaven and see whos there there will probably be some people that you expected to see who arent there and then there will be some that you never thought youd see in heaven standing right there with you
1834537 okay i guess i understand what she meant by people i expected to see there who wont be there i mean im sure there are a lot of people who think they are christian but who really arent in their hearts or some who claim to be saved but who arent really born again but how would people be there that i didnt even know were christian what does that mean
1834538 well hon there are probably some people in the world who are embarrassed to be religious and who dont let others know that they are christian i knew a guy like that once one of my good friends from high school he really did love god and he went to church every sunday and enjoyed being a christian but i only knew that because i was close to him most people didnt know that about him
1834539 okay but how can one really enjoy being a christian and thoroughly love christ yet be embarrassed or ashamed of it i mean are they truly christian then if thats the case
1834540 well sure if they are true in their hearts and accepted christ as their savior theyll go to heaven theyre christian but unfortunately they probably wont have the same level of rewards in heaven that strong open christians will get and i bet when they get there theyll regret it
1834541 well i guess i can see why timid or introverted personalities would have a hard time being christian there are a lot of people out there who think enthusiastic zealous christians are freaks or weirdos
1834542 relax a little i believe in god and know that he does great things too but you dont have to live it 24 7 you push people away when you do that its kind of weird
1834543 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels
1834544 you made the choice and decided that youd rather have those few earthly rewards than to have my eternal rewards here in heaven you made the decision that you didnt need me or want me be gone with you i never knew you
1834545 hey jesus i dont care about you or want to know you so just leave me alone
1834546 lord are only a few people going to be saved
1834547 make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading sir open the door for us
1834548 but he will answer i dont know you or where you come from
1834549 then you will say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets
1834550 but he will reply i dont know you or where you come from away from me all you evildoers
1834551 there will be weeping there and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves thrown out people will come from east and west and north and south and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of god indeed there are those who are last who will be first and first who will be last
1834552 but i believed in god i said i believed in god i prayed now and then i went to church on holidays i gave money to the poor

1834555 our main audience country music decision makers are not that web savvy in my experience
1834556 there is considerable marketplace interest in the gametap business and brand we are considering various strategic options but have reached no final agreement as yet when there is a resolution we will announce it
1834557 but in another aspect the business media shed ciscos earnings in too positive a light siding with the small beat of expectations in the quarter just passed vs the small notes of caution the company laid down about the future
1834558 this is not uncommon nor totally inappropriate but in all articles that are more positive than not about a company that obviously reported just better than expected earnings you the savvy investor should decide where that positivity stems from is what youre reading colored for example by a particularly good day in the stock market
1834559 you need two things on every page you must have one beautiful sentence beautiful enough that someone would want to read it to a friend you must have an invocation of one sense beyond sight and sound you need the first because you are competing with all the dead writers and the second because you are competing with god

1834561 as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1834562 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now

1834775 if this movie doesnt touch you go ahead and touch yourself

1834788 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool van de hoop doelwit van protest is geworden door de enorme mediabelangstelling is de tocht hier ideaal voor door het herstellen van de oude traditie voorkom je tevens dat dit olympische symbool kapot gaat

1834794 er is muziek over thee er zijn oude gedichten over thee
1834795 er zijn duizenden theemeesters in china het examen is door het hele land hetzelfde je hebt drie niveaus het eerste niveau is nog goed te doen maar het tweede en het derde niveau zijn moeilijk zo ver ben ik niet gekomen maar ook voor het eerste niveau moet je al alles weten over de geschiedenis van de zes chinese theesoorten verder moet je de guzheng leren bespelen een snaarinstrument dat tijdens de theeceremonie klinkt je moet zonder hulpmiddelen de temperatuur van het water kunnen bepalen precies weten hoeveel thee je moet afwegen voor hoeveel personen hoe lang allerlei soorten thee moeten trekken enzovoorts
1834796 het gaat geweldig het bedrijf verdient enorm aan de medicijnen dus er is geld genoeg om de theepoot te ontwikkelen en nieuwe producten uit te denken
1834797 we willen honderden van zulke winkeltjes openen ook in het buitenland een keten worden zoals mcdonalds
1834798 het meeste wat je hoort over die langgerijpte thee is nep ben ik bang
1834799 er wordt soms over deze thee gepraat als over wijn pu erh thee is een statussymbool geworden
1834800 mensen beweren dat ze kunnen proeven uit welke streek de thee komt en dat de geur verschilt van berg tot berg ik heb sinds ik voor long run werk ontzettend veel thee geproefd natuurlijk er is verschil tussen jonge en oude thee tussen oude en gefermenteerde maar om nu te zeggen dat er verschil is tussen wat al deze bedrijven hier op deze theebeurs aanbieden laat ik zeggen ik proef het niet
1834801 if you cant get oxycontin youre going to do everything you can to get heroin because herion is the same effect
1834802 steeds meer wandelaars willen van het landschap genieten door de geschiedenis te lezen
1834803 dit zijn juist elementen waaraan je de historie van het landschap kunt zien
1834804 maar ze worden slecht beschermd sommige zijn gedempt bij de dijkverzwaring en een aantal is gebruikt als visvijver of voor afvaldump
1834805 utrecht heeft de waaien in eemland drie jaar geleden benoemd tot aardkundig monument er moeten er honderden zijn rond of ovaal van vorm hoofdzakelijk in het rivierengebied maar ook langs de zee in zeeland friesland en hier langs de zuiderzee de meeste zijn een paar meter diep en een of twee hectare groot maar er zijn uitzonderingen het haarsteegse wiel bij vlijmen is liefst 18 hectare groot
1834806 het was puike landbouwgrond daarom werden nieuwe dijken om de wielen heen gelegd in de betuwe zijn daar de eerste fruitboomgaarden aangeplant
1834807 de bedding van de rivier is hierdoor op sommige plaatsen niet meer groot genoeg wat de kansen op nieuwe overstromingen heeft vergroot tot halverwege de vorige eeuw kenden we overlaten om in geval van nood landerijen te laten onderlopen inmiddels verlaagt rijkswaterstaat de uiterwaarden en legt alternatieve waterbergingsgebieden aan de zogeheten groene rivieren
1834808 about halfway down the wall the darker line thats normal
1834809 do that earlier on and in smaller steps maybe what will happen is we can provide everything needed downstream and keep lake levels as high as it can be
1834810 we think the water permit as we have requested it is a good compromise for all those people and indeed try to meet the needs of all those various interests
1834811 state agencies commercial interests theres a power plant further down the river that requires water every one has a specific interest in that water
1834812 weer een stap op de verkeerde weg waar we al zoveel voorbeelden van hebben gezien van het niet meedoen aan het kyoto verdrag tot de inval in irak
1834813 toen de vs nog maar pas bestonden hadden de staten nog bijna alles te zeggen daardoor konden ze dingen doen die het land in verlegenheid brachten er is een bekend geval van een diplomaat ik meen uit frankrijk die in philadelphia werd gemolesteerd de staat pennsylvania deed niets
1834814 ik denk dat de rechters het gewoon niet eens waren met het oordeel van het internationale hof
1834815 een wet aannemen waardoor een moordenaar niet wordt terechtgesteld dat doe je niet in een verkiezingsjaar
1834816 het is een lieve man maar ik moet iedere keer weer bijkomen van zijn gedrag siem is niet te stoppen
1834817 zijn lekkerste ontbijt siem wordt nog even verwend voor ik vertrek
1834818 daar ga ik eerst drie dagen op een bankje zitten helemaal niks doen genieten van de stilte daarna wandelen met vriendinnen kletsen en een bezoek brengen aan de paters in de abdij
1834819 ik ben al veertig jaar mantelzorger in 1958 siem was 23 viel hij van een hooiwagen hij werkte op de boerderij van zijn vader siem was buiten bewustzijn geraakt en is toen op bed gelegd het bloed kwam uit zijn oren en neus vertelden ze me later pas een dag later is hij naar een ziekenhuis gebracht waar hij twee weken in coma heeft gelegen hij kwam bij maar vanaf die tijd is het langzaam slechter gegaan met siem ik wist niets van het ongeluk pas na ons huwelijk is me alles verteld siem heeft een behoorlijke hersenbeschadiging opgelopen hij is zes keer opgenomen in een psychiatrisch ziekenhuis zijn familie vond dat niet leuk in deze contreien is het een schande als je in de psychiatrie terechtkomt er mankeerde siem niets het was allemaal mijn schuld
1834820 siem was opgenomen en ik besloot meteen naar het kasteel te gaan
1834821 in de trein hield ik mijn tas stijf tegen me aan ik zat er zo doorheen dat ik bang was dat ik hem zou vergeten als ik aankwam
1834822 ja maar in het weekeinde mag hij niet voor half acht zijn bed uit
1834823 en de keuken blijft verboden terrein want hij eet alles op wat hij ziet staan
1834824 het interesseert me even geen meter hoe het met siem gaat
1834825 ik woon hier een week dus verschuif ik hier en daar wat alles van siem laat ik zoals het is anders raakt hij overstuur ik neem altijd wat dingetjes mee om me thuis te voelen bij mijn logeerbed staan wat fotos van mijn kinderen en kleinkinderen
1834826 zeven jaar geleden overleed mijn man plotseling aan een hartstilstand we waren net naar zeeland verhuisd voor mij een vreemde omgeving na anderhalf jaar zei een vriendin tegen me dat ik mantelzorgvervanger moest worden ze was ermee in contact gekomen en het leek haar echt iets voor mij ik heb altijd in de zorg gewerkt hielp ouders met opvoedingsproblemen
1834827 het geeft me energie ik hoef niks ik mag alles
1834828 het is niet alleen zorgen wat ik doe ik kwam jaren bij een oude vrouw dik in de negentig in moergestel ik zette haar in de auto en maakte heerlijke tochten met haar overal waar ik kom ga ik op zoek naar de mooie en leuke plekjes het enige wat ik mis is mijn zangles ik kan in die weken dat ik mantelzorgers vervang niet naar koor zingen doe ik dus iedere middag in huis dus de buren moeten er maar aan wennen
1834829 ik weet dat sommige mensen voor wie ik zorg snel overlijden maar ik kan niet altijd naar hun begrafenis de mantelzorgers weten dat ik hen verder nooit meer bel om te vragen hoe het met ze gaat kaartjes stuur ik alleen aan de verstandelijk gehandicapten voor wie ik geregeld zorg als ik iedereen kaartjes stuur schept dat verplichtingen

1834911 we just had the largest showcase you could possibly ask for in front of the industry and in front of america and weve gained so many fans and were so thankful for that
1834912 shes got such a great story and shes such a strong woman she really stands for a lot of people fighting for their dream and i think it was a great opportunity in her life
1834913 she already pursued music once and kind of put it aside for awhile and this was an opportunity for her to come back and really make it happen and im so happy that she did so i really think that it wasnt that america didnt see something in us i think it was a lot of people really connected with her story and they just wanted to see it happen for her and it just so happened that it did and i think were both really grateful for it
1834914 when i moved to jeffrey i got something a little bit different
1834915 but that whole situation i believe was handled so professional i just walked in and pretty much told john respectfully no disrespect to you john the way that you carry yourself and the way you communicate with people it makes you john rich but the way i carry myself and the way i communicate with people is a whole different thing and its what makes me me and right now its just not working out i really think that by standing up for myself i really gained a lot of respect from him i wouldnt take any decision back

1834917 its one of those situations to where every week that i heard my name called and knowing that america was behind me it made me that much more stronger to embrace myself as a person and to really see that theres something unique there that people really related to and embraced
1834918 so i in turn need to embrace it and so i just decided to come out a brand new person and im so thankful for it because im so much more happier now
1834919 america really gave me the opportunity to truly love myself and im so grateful for that
1834920 i keep emphasizing it and i cant emphasize it enough is the fact that america really changed who i was and so did all the contestants here on the show they truly showed me a lot of love and that im a great person and that im beautiful in my own skin and it really helped me embrace it
1834921 jeffrey pulled me off to the side and said i know youre going to probably want to take a couple days to relax

1834929 the two robbers were masked they were wearing gloves and the both were armed they had tied up one of the employees at the microtel and beaten him up and were attempting to get into a safe

1834932 i intend to make unmistakably clear to iran we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the united states to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions
1834933 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
1834934 aggressive principled diplomacy without self defeating preconditions but with a clear eyed understanding of our interests
1834935 would be a profound mistake for us to initiate a war with iran
1834936 as president i will take the lead to work for a world in which the roles and risks of nuclear weapons can be reduced and ultimately eliminated
1834937 a quarter of a century ago president ronald reagan declared our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the earth that is my dream too
1834938 i would cancel all further work on the so called robust nuclear earth penetrator a weapon that does not make strategic or political sense
1834939 the viability of our nuclear deterrent is too central to our national security to rush approval of a treaty that cannot be verified and that will facilitate the decline of that deterrent

1834941 the bush administration has in the past exaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for political purposes
1834942 i dont care what president vladimir putins objections are to it
1834943 if we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should but only when the system works
1834944 we should continue to pursue the kind of direct and aggressive diplomacy with north korea that can yield results the objective must be clear the complete and verifiable elimination of north koreas nuclear weapons programs

1834956 this case the loss of this officer drives home the point that we can not have any tolerance for people who get on the highway and drive under the influence especially twice the legal limit i dont know what it will take for people to learn that officers law enforcement and prosecutors just will not put up with this anymore

1835017 follow your steps and you will find the unknown ways are in your mind
1835018 yeah were going to have to do that because you cant putt it across these greens
1835019 and in only one day its crazy how much faster and harder they are
1835020 they were already tough holes when we had say a 4 iron in our hand but now with 3 woods theyre very difficult
1835021 but this is certainly the hardest group of par 3s ive ever played
1835022 you know if youre hitting those clubs youre going to miss some of those greens
1835023 even hitting a good shot youre going to miss some of those greens
1835024 this is as tough of a setup as ive ever seen
1835025 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough u s tour event
1835026 its nearly more u s open type that the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
1835027 it doesnt seem long because youve just come from birkdale
1835028 but its 4 inches and thick enough if youre more than 100 yards youre not going to get to the green from too many lies
1835029 the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should
1835030 so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
1835031 but i can see it going the other way too
1835032 this has the potential to play as the hardest major
1835033 and thats never the case usually of the four majors if you played your best you could score here now you could play great and 70 might be awesome
1835034 you look at guys who have not won majors who at my age 38 or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through theres a lot of guys playing very good golf
1835035 i had an ok year in 2005 heading in a couple of wins and looked at it as though it would make an ok year great and i feel the same way this year
1835036 its been an ok year but winning the last major could turn it into something special
1835037 im reasonably confident that i can get my game in shape come thursday and it is a tough golf course which suits me

1835085 my children are growing up well and doing excellently at school we have a mother love bond that was created during breastfeeding and exists between us and that makes me very happy
1835086 breast milk is a gift of life to infants the best nutrition option and a good preventive medicine against common diseases
1835087 support for the mother especially a young mother has tremendous impact it motivates mothers to breastfeed longer and also gives them confidence that they are doing something very important that the child and all of society values
1835088 what this means to us is that maybe we can have a shot at a normal life
1835089 i was one of these kids playing street soccer and dreaming of a better life

1835102 he is not a kid at all he is completely full formed
1835103 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury

1835110 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1835111 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1835112 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1835113 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation
1835114 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and that it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1835115 ivins had a history of mental health problems and was facing a difficult time professionally in the summer and fall of 2001 because an anthrax vaccine he was working on was failing
1835116 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
1835117 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation

1835145 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1835146 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1835147 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say thatwe screwed up
1835148 in their post event examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1835149 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1835150 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in thecloud like mobileme
1835151 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1835152 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch
1835153 people say this is even better than all the rumors
1835154 they wont do this on hardware or the os but maybe on these internet related services they will

1835204 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1835205 we just want the jury to hear the evidence and make a decision
1835206 the second attendant said she would call cleaning personnel and headed to the cockpit the faa said victoria osteen followed her and came across brown whom she pushed and elbowed in an attempt to get to the cockpit according to the report
1835207 this outcome was pre determined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
1835208 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1835209 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully

1835217 rick davis earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying for dhl
1835218 now its time to see if he and john mccain will use their considerable clout to lobby for ohio families
1835219 it is unconscionable to have access to help for these families but not explore every possible solution to save these jobs
1835220 john mccain should act as aggressively to save wilmington jobs as he did to expedite the sale of airborne to deutsche post instead of action hes taken a path of indifference ohioans need a president who will fight for them
1835221 mr davis and sen mccain have this crucial connection in this whole fight and yet they said nothing about any of this to anybody that we know
1835222 rick davis made hundreds of thousands of dollars to help broker the deal we want him to use his considerable connection to dhl to help wilmington families with these jobs at risk the people of wilmington deserve some straight talk from john mccain tomorrow when he comes to town

1835233 nuestro candidato presidencial tiene todo el derecho de reunirse con las agrupaciones de trabajadores que desee es m s es su deber hacerlo porque para gobernar el pa s es necesario conocer a fondo las necesidades de todos los chilenos
1835234 ellos bajo el amparo de la ley constituyeron una asociaci n gremial para buscar mejoras en el funcionamiento interno de gendarmer a y sus condiciones de trabajo y en este marco han sostenido reuniones con diversos personeros de distintos partidos pol ticos y de distinto mbito por lo mismo la actitud del director de gendarmer a atenta claramente contra los derechos de los trabajadores de nuestro pa s
1835235 la comisi n de trabajo muchas veces ha recibido a trabajadores que son v ctimas de pr cticas antisindicales por eso tomamos la decisi n de invitar a la directiva de la agrupaci n de funcionarios de gendarmer a y a quienes se reunieron con sebasti n pi era para escucharlos y respaldar sus derechos fundamentales

1835249 this product represents a very big effort by the tobacco industry to produce a safer cigarette the problem is how can they say its safe when the science to support the claim isnt there yet
1835250 clarify who she believes is drilling off the coast of florida and whether or not she is trying to raise funds based on a claim that china or cuba is drilling near our shores
1835251 the chinese are drilling off the coast of florida with their new energy partner cuba
1835252 while there has been some concern about chinas potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects to date its involvement in cubas oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in pinar del rio province through its state run china petroleum and chemical corporation sinopec
1835253 chinese and others have partnered with cuba to drill for oil
1835254 apparently in her efforts to frighten the citizens of the second congressional district into believing the red menace is about to come ashore congresswoman schmidt cannot decide which red menace the chinese red menace or the cuban red menace
1835255 she makes a claim on the floor of the house that is patently wrong refuses to correct it
1835256 then she tries to make money off of it when challenged her staff claims the letter didnt come from her
1835257 seemed like parts of it were accurate and came from our letter and parts of it might be bogus
1835258 i dont know i have not seen the letter it wasnt until the second phone call that he wanted to challenge us and come back after us that he was like well i have it and i said did you have it when you spoke to me why didnt you send that to me that would have been a lot easier for me to identify for you
1835259 we have seen that vic is willing to turn her head while prisoners in china are used for medical experiments

1835261 they cant say that they havent read the letter and then discuss in detail the contents of the letter
1835262 our point is that two years ago vic wulsin was a proponent of a 50 cents a gallon gas tax
1835263 and so far she has not backed away from that
1835264 the memo thats out there publicly basically states that she gave them a way forward to continue these tests
1835265 that doesnt sound like a peer review she gave them a way to get to the next steps
1835266 she needs to have a complete airing of her activities her involvement how she was paid what her intentions were by saying if you want to continue doing experiments heres how you should do it

1835276 the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition
1835277 open competition is too costly to contemplate and is likely to lead to the breakdown of our public services and no effective middle course appears possible without subsidies the complete coordination of transport by means of a scheme of unification is the only way to get the best possible service at the lowest economic cost
1835278 one of the main follies of nationalisation from the socialist point of view was that the previous owners of the industries were fully compensated for being dispossessed of their shares by being given equivalent amounts in guilt edged stock as a result the capitalist classes were no poorer than they had been before in many cases they were enriched because their assets had been sunk in declining concerns instead of furthering the socialist objective of greater equality all that happened was that the state acquired large amounts of often run down assets at an inflated cost
1835279 was unplanned un centralised undemocratic and under resourced dominated by doctors and increasingly by the hospital services its priorities emphasised intervention rather than prevention and acute care rather than the chronically ill
1835280 no system of state ownership will be acceptable to organised railwaymen which does not guarantee to them their full political and social rights allow them a due measure of control and responsibility on the safe and efficient working of the railway system and ensure them a fair and equitable participation in the increased benefits likely to accrue from a more economical and scientific administration
1835281 the only difference was i had a br cap instead of a gwr one we still had the same bosses
1835282 nowhere in the world had economic democracy in the fullest sense functioned successfully
1835283 there are two main arguments from a labour point of view against the representative idea the first is that a board appointed on grounds of ability is likely to be far more efficient and socialists above all must keep the communal interest to the fore members appointed by particular interests would naturally tend to concentrate primarily on pleasing those interests rather than concerned without fear or favour with the general efficiency of the undertaking their control or influence by such interest might be injurious to a proper corporate spirit and would diminish the very necessary responsibility to the public as a whole nor does the appointment of members selected in a representative capacity and not primarily or mainly for their personal ability appear likely to result in the most efficient board for a task which is complex and highly responsible for it is vital to socialism that national ownership should show itself superior to private enterprise in all round efficiency emphasis in the original
1835284 i now fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important here the political legitimacy of the market economy itself

1835299 im younger fitter stronger and smarter despite his advanced age im sure that doug will push himself hard because he wants to win as badly as i do knowing him as i do im confident that it wont be a clean fight but ive got some tricks up my sleeve as well ive done marathons and triathlons but the bicycle race with doug will certainly be the greatest challenge yet im not sure if its a good career move to beat the boss but im going for it

1835301 created a significant incentive for people to delay the purchase of a property in the hope of avoiding the payment of stamp duty on the transaction the uncertainty can only undermine the market further reducing the volume of transactions when they are already at historic lows

1835359 individual decisions are by design fully and totally autonomous this is a hallmark and unifying principle and all of our freedoms in this country are built upon it
1835360 both identities a gay one as well as a self actualized female one directly challenge the inherent belief structure social construct and worth of attribute arguments central to a dominant patriarchal structure
1835361 both identities a gay one as well as a self actualized female one directly challenge the inherent belief structure social construct and worth of attribute arguments central to a dominant patriarchal structure
1835362 what could be more compatible with true patriarchy than male homosexuality especially if it extended into the realm of the nuclear family and child rearing
1835363 why do you separate the subject from the predicate in a lot of your sentences with a comma its very distracting
1835364 happiness and its pursuit are local known only to an individual therefore decisions around it are autonomous i think that is pretty clear
1835365 i see your point but you would be best to remember that we are dealing with patriarchy as it exists in the world and culture we live in today which as i have indicated is anything but compatible with those identities
1835366 all philosophical theories pertaining to autonomy especially feminist ones that im aware of do not propose that individual decisions are by design fully and totally autonomous quite the opposite
1835367 are you kidding me the underlying structure and base assertion of all forms of feminism is that women are and should be considered human beings rather unambiguous is it not
1835368 that theory base defines the use of the term autonomy because it autonomy is fundamental to the concept of personal agency bodily integrity that is so fundamental to the movement i have to question who you are quoting or getting this so called feminist theory from hoff summers for the last time is not a feminist
1835369 ooooh look how bad society is when they dont respect their elders
1835370 we have a guy investigating our athletes who has tiger paws in his office
1835371 are responsible for patrolling the campus and responding to all calls for police assistance 24 hours a day every day
1835372 the traditional police services such as vehicle bicycle and foot patrol responds to criminal incidents burglar fire alarms and all types of emergencies and calls for service
1835373 as president i take seriously concerns expressed about any aspect of our university and its treatment of our students
1835374 i am mindful of the importance of having a trusted and respected campus law enforcement division which i believe we have working on behalf of the entire university family to provide a safe campus environment i have confidence in the professionalism of our police officers and i will work to ensure that their actions instill in the university community a similar level of confidence
1835375 the primary goal of our campus police is to protect our students
1835376 theyre supposed to police too but the role of a campus police is much different than the city police protecting our students should be their main goal
1835377 i think its under control but there has been an attitude there have been some allegations that i havent totally tracked down of the police high fiving when they catch an athlete
1835378 stephen garcia got in i think thats good he was treated very unfairly
1835379 hes a good kid he was immature but im tickled hes back i think we did the right thing we really looked at the case he was targeted to a certain extent
1835380 everybody thinks i talk with him a lot but i dont i dont harass a coach i pull for them but i dont call to talk with them very often
1835381 our students are very important to us their campus police job is to protect our students
1835382 harris pastides has a tremendous interest in our athletic program at the university of south carolina
1835383 he will help in any way he can to make our athletic program as good as it can be i dont know how to say it any better than that im really tickled at his attitude towards athletics
1835384 president pastides will be a great asset for our athletic program
1835385 hes going to encourage our coaches to do better hell take an active role with the athletic department if necessary he enjoys athletics himself he enjoys sports he understands the value of a good athletic program to the overall university

1835417 other countries and old rivals like australia now look to us as a country that got serious about sport and are saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table he said
1835418 we are about to enter a glorious new era for british sport and i hope success in beijing will inspire the next generation of young sports stars

1835436 militaries tend to be most effective when used against terrorist groups engaged in an insurgency in which the groups were large well armed and well organized insurgent groups have been among the most capable and lethal terrorist groups and military force has usually been a necessary component in such cases
1835437 against most terrorist groups however military force is usually too blunt an instrument
1835438 the u s military should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in muslim societies since its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment
1835439 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
1835440 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves

1835523 i know our heartland division is physical and we thunder bay are well balanced
1835524 we can defend well we have a good goalkeeper in stephen paterson and we have the ability to go forward we can adjust to any style of play
1835525 the last two seasons have been our best because we were able to attract more quality players this season has really been big from an education standpoint
1835526 people around thunder bay didnt realize that this was a 67 team league
1835527 they thought the six team heartland division was our league when we won the heartland people thought we had won the whole thing then we won again and the community noticed vancouver was coming to town and they know the whitecaps from the nasl so that helped our image now were telling them we are going to be on national television on fox soccer channel that really put things into perspective people are starting to understand that this is the third division of soccer here in canada
1835528 our expectations changed around the time we brought in brandon swartzendruber
1835529 he is a great center forward that a lot of teams would love to have he isnt flashy he just works hard for 90 minutes and gets the job done he could have moved up to usl first division this season but he decided he wanted to come back and try to win a pdl championship

1835567 we hope to bring the first legitimate complaint under the mn statute and stop robocalls in minnesota in time for the election this fall
1835568 it is time that minnesota voters are able to protect their privacy robocalls in the state are illegal but no one has enforced the law to date in fact during the most recent primaries mn voters were inundated with millions of robocalls from both mccain and obama
1835569 the message is immediately preceded by a live operator who obtains the subscribers consent before the message is delivered
1835570 gt pew internet amp american life project 81 percent of iowa voters in the presidential caucuses received robocalls also according to pew robocalls are now the top form of congressional communication
1835571 with the 2008 presidential election garnering more attention than elections in the recent past it is a sure bet that campaigns will turn to robocalls as a way to get their message out particularly in mn which has 10 critical electoral college votes
1835572 while we have a base of voters that have registered their number for free at stoppoliticalcalls org to start with if other mn voters want to join the registry we will be happy to hear from them and will include them in the complaint filed with the mn ag
1835573 we hope to put a robo hold on all mn campaign robocalls this fall

1835576 i knew it was going to be a long project i think we made a lot of strides since weve been here
1835577 i remember in my first press conference i think the very first day i was at vanderbilt some guy said how long do you think youve got before they fire you really he did
1835578 were hoping we can get it done i think we made strides toward that i think we were extremely close last year a couple games go either way were in a bowl
1835579 probably not many times but you know we dont talk to our players about that we dont really even discuss it as coaches
1835580 sometimes you can be a better football team even though you dont have the better athletes
1835581 ive never really felt like our players quit in a game since ive been at vanderbilt thats something i really appreciate from our players and that means a lot to a coach
1835582 i jumped out and put the sign in the ground i crossed the road and after i crossed the road to that side over there tom reich pulled up with a camera and he started screaming and swearing at me that he caught me
1835583 there was no reason for them to put up more signs they already had four signs so with that i would say theres no truth to that statement whatsoever

1835611 the article describes a lawsuit filed in federal court by the afa center for law and policy clp on behalf of the parents of students at greendale baptist academy
1835612 the news media has been saying that some members of congress and members of the aclu oppose many of the justice department proposals for combating terrorism saying that they are unconstitutional and infringe too much on civil liberties many people dont know it but the official aclu position is to oppose all metal detectors in airports and schools and other public buildings its interesting that we may now be living in a time when our biggest threat to civil liberties and freedom doesnt come from the government but fiom enemies of the government osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans but i guess that doesnt mean a lot to the aclu maybe i should move to canada

1835629 the issue of the premiers involvement in the selection process was never on the agenda of a meeting of the board nor was it ever voted on by the board
1835630 to contend that the board of regents formally approved endorsed or supported the premiers involvement is not correct in fact the recollection of several regents is that the chair brought the issue of the governments involvement to the attention of the board only after the minister of education had interviewed two candidates and the chair had been advised that the candidates were not acceptable

1835698 they took us to seattle and we spent the night there without eating without knowing where we were going
1835699 they gave us court dates but i dont remember if they gave me a choice to return home
1835700 i thought that they were going to send us back
1835701 the little that id saved has been spent i was planning to leave in october 2007 to be with my daughter on her 15th birthday but then this happened

1835712 the truth is that there are so many businesses up and down the street that are empty were committed to quality businesses and also to filling up the empty storefronts zieglers idea and the part that was exciting to hear was that dads used to be a family restaurant she wanted to bring it back to that

1835714 why do they need another f bar theres like six in one block

1835794 wear it on the strets and then straight to the beach
1835795 in purely statistical terms do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
1835796 at times over the last month ive doubted that the bulletin actually exists a tiny newspaper from the houston suburbs filled week after week with bowdlerized joe conason columns and record reviews airlifted from the pages of slate it seemed preposterous and the longer i spent squinting into the of the bulletin s web 0 0 quality internet site the more i began to suspect that i was the dupe of a conceptual art prank a cheeky borgesian commentary on the slipperiness of language and authorship or something
1835797 due to the nations need for energy and dependable shipping lanes we are losing a football fields worth of wetlands every 45 minutes to erosion this unrivaled land loss threatens the nations fishing our energy our ports and most importantly leaves new orleans increasingly vulnerable to storms such as katrina

1835812 schon aus sicht der eu energieplanung f r 2020 ist es notwendig diese gelder aus der atomforschung in nachhaltige koenergie forschung umzuleiten anders erscheint es wenig realistisch die gesetzten klimaschutzziele auch halten zu k nnen
1835813 euro energy soll die europaweite forschung und entwicklung im bereich kologische und nachhaltige energien auf eine neue ebene heben damit entst nde auch die grundlage f r die vernetzung der aktuellen nationalen koenergieprogramme von der vernetzten forschung w rden alle eu staaten profitieren
1835814 noch besser als der blo e ausstieg aus euratom ist es wenn die bisherigen euratom gelder in alternative energieforschung und f rderung umgeleitet werden damit w rde eine leistungsstarke basis f r die kologische energiezukunft europas geschaffen
1835815 gerade angesichts der versuche der atombranche sich als co2 freundliche klimaalternative zu positionieren muss jetzt die eu ein gegenteiliges signal setzen die einseitige f rderung der atomenergie ist durch eine breite offensive hin zu nachhaltigen energien zu ersetzen

1835856 there are important contemporary lessons to be learned from solzhenitsyns life and work which transcend russia and communism these lessons are overdue for todays american diplomacy thus far the west has failed to find a comparable titan for the war of ideas we need to wage against islamist radicalism championing anti authoritarian moderates and freedom fighters should take priority over pushing through hasty elections and calling the process democracy promotion a new u s public diplomacy and strategic communications agency would be instrumental in accomplishing such goals as are non profit organizations around the world

1835858 all i can do is come out here every day and try and be the best player i can be my job right now is to be a leader in this team and get the guys out there better i believe in our system and i believe in what we are doing around here i expect those other young guy receivers to go out there and have no drop off at the receiver position
1835859 all i can do is come out here and be the best i can be im just out here to work hard
1835860 its just being more responsible its just being the best i can be in the community and on the field that is all it is its not hard its not rocket science like i said i have a job to do and i plan on getting it done
1835861 it is three games i guess if i do some things it might be two all i can do is take everything in and continue to work hard ive got guys out there that have to get ready for this game so i can be a leader verbally and with my actions
1835862 im not sure but im pretty sure i will find out in the next couple of days
1835863 like i said im just going to do what i am supposed to do whether it is off the field or on the field and get past this one thing about our organization our team is that they make it easy for me to come out here and not have the weight of the world on my shoulders like i said i gave that weight for someone else to carry
1835864 continue to work hard otherwise i am feeling good i am enjoying camp i am out there running the routes and i am excited to see where we will go as a team and as an organization
1835865 its been an ongoing process i wasnt really sure what was going to happen as i told brandon dont worry about something you have no control over i said what you have to do is try to be the best person you can possibly be on a day to day basis go out there and take it day by day do the best job you can on the football field i said you have to be a leader not only on the football field but in the community as well you have to prove to people that you want to be one of the top players who have ever played here you have to be like a guy like rod smith who lives it and does it thats the challenge for brandon and he is taking it day by day ive been pleased with how he has handled himself you cant do anything about the past but you can do something about the future i like the way he has handled himself both on and off the football field and thats what he has to concentrate on
1835866 there is no question about it he has grown up since hes been here as a football player and knowing how to practice and how to handle himself ive seen him grow day by day he understands what it means to be a leader as an athlete and be a leader in the community and help kids he wants to do those types of things hes a guy that has a big upside not only on the field but off the field hes a natural leader he is going to show people in the community that this isnt talk this is something that he is going to prove to not only denver but the county that hes not only a great football player but hes a quality person
1835867 you cant worry about those things rb ryan torain today he broke a little bone in the radius in the upper part of the elbow he broke a bone he is going to be out anywhere from probably six to eight weeks depending on what the mri shows thats football you are going to lose guys to injury there is nothing you can do about the situation at hand except get better and brandon to me is doing things the right way he is going to go out there and try to prove himself that he is not only a great player but a consistent player and he has to prove to everybody that he can be a great player off the field as well its a great challenge ahead i like the way he has handled is thus far and hopefully he can keep it going
1835868 its a big loss i thought he had a chance to compete to be the starting running back hes one of the most gifted running backs ive been around for a long time he is very similar to terrell davis when he came in obviously he has a setback that he has to deal with its tough with these guys he has to take it day by day as well but any time you break a bone in that elbow area obviously its a setback im just hoping there is not too much ligament damage but we will find out obviously after the mri
1835869 it took him a while to get back into football shape i think it took him about four or five days to get back into football shape even though he ran for a month and lifted for a month there is nothing like wearing those shoulder pads its not only him but a number of our guys as well he has been looking good and i just like his mindset i just said hey dont worry about something you cant control worry about what you can do today and be the best at what you can do i think thats what he is doing both on and off the football field that gives him a chance to have a great future
1835870 i cant answer that at this point the chances are we will keep it very close to what the game plan would be if he was playing in the first game we havent talked in detail about that
1835871 you have a number of running backs and the reason why you have to have depth is because of what we went through today wit h ryan there are running backs that get banged up every once in a while and if they do you have to have some guys that are proven and some guys that have some ability i think we have a little combination of both
1835872 it is unfortunate to lose a player like that for two games it hurts but that is why we brought in more receivers we have eddie royal we have good tight ends we have a good offensive line and our running backs are playing really well someone has to step up thats what it boils down to there will be a little more pressure on the offense but there are 13 or 14 games after that depending on whether he gets two or three
1835873 i dont think anyone was that surprised by it we were expecting two to four games and we have heard the rumors for the past few days i dont think anyone was that surprised by it
1835874 brandon is not a bad guy at all i have known brandon since we came in we have been in atlanta together we go to dinner all the time he is a good guy and he means well he has just been in some sticky situations and things he probably shouldnt get into he understands the situation that he is in and he understands that you only get so many chances and i think it definitely hit home with this i dont expect brandon to be in anymore situations like that for the rest of his career probably for the rest of his life
1835875 he is really talented he is a big guy and has good moves he sees the field well he picked up the offense quickly and he was protecting well i think he is still going to be a good back i havent heard what the prognosis is or how long he is going to be out but he will definitely help this team out in the future he will be ready for the second half of the season and we will definitely use him
1835876 he is doing well he has been in there since day one and there is a lot of pressure on him to come in here and start at left tackle in a league with some really good defensive ends and outside linebackers that are coming his way he stepped up and learned the offense he is doing well right now he is picking up the offense well because he has been in there since otas by now he should have it
1835877 i dont think that i have ever had a dead arm at camp my arm is kind of like rubber i can throw for a long time and a lot of balls and only need a little ice here and there my arm feels good right now at the beginning of camp i was taking a lot of reps but we have scaled it back a bit with the throwing i feel fine
1835878 i think it has been good i think that quarterbacks coach jeremy bates is doing a great job for us with calling some plays and working with me at the quarterback position our receivers are playing well and our offensive line is doing a great job i couldnt be more pleased with the way they are playing right now our tight ends and running backs are doing well we have a lot of competition at the running back position right now and with ryan torain down it kind of opens up the door for the other three to fight it out offensively i am really pleased
1835879 i am playing well i am making mistakes still but that is all part of it i have a good feel for the offense we are doing a lot of stuff right now we are kind of feeling some stuff out right now to see what direction we want to go we have gotten a lot of plays in it has been really good
1835880 any time you lose a guy like brandon for a couple games it is going to hurt he does some things on the football field that not many people can do he opens up some big windows for me and he is an easy target i have a lot of confidence in d jack darrel jackson keary colbert eddie royal and our tight ends we will split them out some and use them a little bit we are going to have to make due we dont have any choice with it we dont make the decision so we are going to have to move on and make it happen without him
1835881 in purely statistical terms do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism

1836186 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1836187 the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1836188 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1836189 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1836190 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1836191 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly

1836217 many of us are resentful at a so called nobel peace prize laureate having the audacity to threaten the life of our commander in chief

1836238 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1836239 we have a responsibility to the taxpayer and to the overall financial system to thoroughly analyse and understand these authorities should circumstances ever warrant their use
1836240 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1836241 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements

1836349 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results

1836353 whether it is the young creative entrepreneurs working for a local high tech company or residents like we see in south park who are transforming their neighborhoods or the artists who make up our diverse entertainment scene we have many examples of how creative imaginative passionate people are still shaping daytons personality
1836354 just as the wright brothers paul laurence dunbar and charles kettering did in their day we have our own set of creative originals putting their mark on dayton today
1836355 we feel strongly that daytonians and people throughout this region should be the first to appreciate the many great things we have to enjoy
1836356 if locally we can acknowledge and embrace daytons distinct attributes and assets then we can better tell our story to others which helps us compete more successfully for new businesses and residents
1836357 instead we should better promote and capitalize on what makes dayton a good place to live to locate a business or to visit for fun and entertainment
1836358 we are still very much a community that attracts welcomes and rewards originality in ideas actions and character
1836359 these smart creative energetic people are the kind of originals we want to attract and nurture
1836360 they represent an important element to daytons long term success especially as we continue the transition from a heavy manufacturing based economy to one centered around new and emerging technologies

1836407 the research tells us that statin treatment as it is currently given reduces death and disability from heart disease by about 30
1836408 our contention is that that is a gross underestimate of the benefits we would see if we treated earlier and more aggressively
1836409 study after study in both adults and kids has shown that multiple risk factors accelerate the process of plaque buildup in the arteries known as atherosclerosis
1836410 pediatricians and family physicians should be aware that atherosclerosis can begin very early in life leading to heart disease much earlier in adulthood
1836411 early lifestyle interventions and possibly drugs can reduce this risk
1836412 that goal is currently attainable in many patients with the treatment regimens now available which include statins alone or in combination with other cholesterol lowering drugs
1836413 what people dont realize is these medications can pose a host of side effects including daytime drowsiness even bizarre behavior like sleep walking sleep eating and sleep driving there are alternative treatments such as sound machines that may be quite effective yet pose no risks at all

1836726 the intellectual lassitude we breed in students their unearned and inflated self confidence undercuts both the self discipline and the intellectual modesty that is needed for the apprentice years in the sciences
1836727 i think that a significant part of this problem is that to do science you need to be good at math sadly as this recent nctq study found math is often poorly taught in elementary schools because many of the teachers are weak in math themselves and ill prepared to teach it
1836728 elementary teachers score about 521 high school teachers fare little better they pull in at 576 are the scores of students who intend to pursue a degree in either elementary or secondary education and not teachers at all

1836776 well i know youve been trying to think of other suspects for navys murder
1836777 maybe but im not sure i should be telling you
1836778 no wait you dont have to mention the name of the person you counseled
1836779 yeah what i found out is that he has a side business loan sharking
1836780 youre kidding i wouldnt have thought he had much money to loan
1836781 according to my mr x manny started out small making payday loans
1836782 im guessing that these days he makes way more money with his illegal banking than he does on shoe shines
1836783 navy was getting desperate he didnt have a paying job i think he was just holding out for help from his mother
1836784 and something tells me that if he did borrow money from mr monet it was a lot more than a couple hundred dollars
1836785 lets say it was several thousand then navy couldnt pay it back and maybe he even thumbed his nose at manny thinking there was nothing he could do about it
1836786 yeah but manny couldnt let him get away with that what if word got around maybe ive seen too many movies but wouldnt manny feel he had to go break navys legs or something
1836787 yeah so people would be afraid of him very good elijah i think youve come up with a solid suspect
1836788 i hope thats not gods way of saying hes mad at me
1836789 no i think hes just telling us theres a storm coming
1836790 just give me my cash so i can get out of here
1836791 my girlfriend took it and i dont know what she did with it
1836792 looks like ill have to get it from her myself maybe ill take a little sugar while im at it
1836793 so youre going to stand there and tell me you killed navy
1836794 you chickened out on shooting him so you laced his coffee cake with fish oil
1836795 do you have any idea how much i hate being lied to
1836796 i followed you saturday morning i watched you park your car down the road and then walk back and hide in the woods so you couldnt have been the one who put the fish oil in his coffee cake since you were nowhere near the bakery saturday morning until after he died
1836797 i suppose you could have gotten your girlfriend to do it for you
1836798 but if she was going to poison his coffee cake why would you bother to drive out to the nursing home
1836799 in fact i would think you would have wanted to stay as far away from there as possible

1836940 potentially males of most species can father more offspring than females but this can be strongly influenced by the size or social status of the male with poor quality males failing to breed at all females on the other hand reproduce more consistently if a mother has plentiful resources then it can make sense to invest in producing a son because he is likely to produce more grandchildren than would a daughter however in leaner times having a daughter is a safer bet

1836975 driving this car has been one of the best experiences of my entire life
1836976 lack of scale is the primary reason for the high costs of fuel cell vehicles
1836977 hydrogen is the only viable solution to carbon dioxide free mobility in the future
1836978 whether sharing the road with an unimpressed group of buffalo or sailing along a vast open stretch of tundra at 90 miles an hour the highlander fchv performed without a glitch for seven days and 2300 miles
1836979 the development of toyotas hydrogen fuel cell powertrains continue to move forward and mature at an impressive pace far in advance of an infrastructure that will be necessary to support them
1836980 this is a must have technology for the future of the earth honda will work hard to mainstream fuel cell cars
1836981 basically we can mass produce these now we are waiting for the infrastructure to catch up
1836982 wall street journal other auto makers including nissan motor co and general motors corp are planning to launch electric vehicles but honda isnt offering this alternative why not takeo fukui we feel the practical feasibility of the electric vehicle is very limited the biggest issue is driving distance the other issue is the recharging time the fcx clarity can be recharged in one minute with the electric vehicle it can take several hours however this is not to deny the possibility of battery electric vehicles its very useful for vehicles with restricted applications like golf carts
1836983 there is a group of ev zealots who are constantly criticizing all hydrogen related work based on flawed arguments and without examining all the costs of a plug in system
1836984 battery cars have real limitations hydrogen technology is getting much better
1836985 standing next to a converted plug in prius reinert is in the brown jacket rough language and impassioned rhetoric was exchanged with neither side conceding anything much of the argument boiled down to the perceived demand for fully electric vehicles reinert and toyota contend that there isnt a viable market plug in america says quite the opposite
1836986 more than 500 fuel cell engineers and experts from advanced development laboratories to engineering functions aimed at preparing the fuel cell for commercial sale
1836987 gm has said it will likely have vehicles powered by fuel cells in showrooms by 2012
1836988 dan oconnell a gm fuel cell engineer says he is confident that the company can cut platinum usage by two to three times
1836989 katsuhiko hirose head of toyotas fuel cell project points to the developments made in catalytic converters which use platinum to clean up car exhaust fumes he says when california adopted laws requiring catalytic converters manufacturers sounded similar warnings as the devices needed more than 100g of platinum each thirty years on platinum use has fallen 99
1836990 automotive manufacturers have greatly reduced the amount of platinum they use in catalytic converters and oconnell said the same progress will likely occur with fuel cells
1836991 honda has brought the fuel cell vehicle from the lab to the fleet and finally to the public the major barrier now is building up the hydrogen supply infrastructure
1836992 the potential societal and customer benefits of fuel cell electric vehicles are clear and compelling fuel cell technology promises to deliver family sized automobiles that are fun to drive safe look great refuel fast go far between fill ups and are emissions free and petroleum free and very importantly it holds the promise to do all of this while keeping automobiles affordable to own and operate quite honestly no other technology offers this exciting potential
1836993 its great to have small numbers of these vehicles running around but be very very clear the mission is to heavily penetrate the 70 million cars and trucks that are built worldwide each year with this technology
1836994 we feel it is past time for the necessary infrastructure to accelerate what is urgently needed is sufficient investment by energy providers and the cooperation of government to assure auto companies that the required hydrogen infrastructure will be in place when we deploy our next generation of fuel cell electric vehicles
1836995 the reality is we cannot wait we have to figure out what to do to reach critical mass and create the infrastructure to get these cars on the road sooner than later
1836996 commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years

1837023 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence
1837024 as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
1837025 aggressive regimens with many drugs at the highest tolerated doses were used to maximize the chemotherapeutic benefit
1837026 treatment was protracted lasting more than two years in most patients the results of drug susceptibility testing were used to design and adjust regimens containing at least five drugs that were likely to be effective whenever possible
1837027 this encouraging result constitutes a true change in the current perception of the disease as a virtual death sentence
1837028 the challenge is to make this approach a sustainable reality worldwide
1837029 possibly the strains causing their disease were resistant to more drugs than the strains in peru
1837030 over the years we have become quite proficient at treating multi drug resistant tuberculosis with initial treatment success rates greater than 90 percent in recent years
1837031 extensively drug resistant cases however are much more difficult to treat and we still lose more of these patients than we save

1837040 i know that there are relationships coaches to coaches i know relationships involving coaches with people in the front office coaches with players players with players but its an important message that you need to think about what youre doing
1837041 i look at it as it could be a positive and a negative
1837042 the negative would probably be if he does come hes probably going to play im going to compete but at the same time if they bring him theyre bringing him for a reason the positive is i get to learn from one of the best i could just sit back and watch him and see what he does on the field off the field and try to get better in that aspect
1837043 i know stuff has been leaked that hasnt been true from his point of view
1837044 its hard for him to go back there because of that from their point of view they still have rights because hes under contract its a very unique situation hopefully its resolved somehow

1837057 the us has disregarded icj rulings before the us supreme court has ruled that individual states have absolute authority in such cases
1837058 i applaud the efforts of the government in bringing to justice these 11 individuals who are damaging millions of american families unfortunately this case while representing the largest prosecution in american history is only the tip of the iceberg in an ever growing illegal enterprise that is staying one step ahead of the government and the banking and credit industries to steal consumers identities
1837059 the time has come for those that profit in the credit industry both the banks and the major credit bureaus to begin working with consumer advocates to proactively protect american consumers from those who would prey on their identity and financial well being
1837060 this weeks case must serve as a wake up call for consumers the credit industry and government agencies the current status quo in the banking and credit bureau agencies has failed consumers miserably this week millions will learn they are the victims of identity theft consumers have rights and we all must work together to ensure their rights are protected and identities remain secure

1837138 o que ainda n o est claro para mim o motivo para estes assassinatos os pr prios alem es propuseram tr s 1 que eles estavam sendo realizados para poupar alimentos 2 que eles foram feitos com o prop sito de experimentar novos gases venenosos e raios da morte 3 que eles eram simplesmente o resultado dos nazistas extremos decidirem realizar suas id ias eugenicas e sociol gicas
1837139 o primeiro motivo era absurdo j que a morte de 100 000 pessoas n o pouparia tanta comida para uma na o cuja popula o de 80 milh es al m disso n o havia uma falta aguda de alimentos na alemanha o segundo motivo poss vel embora eu duvide disso os gases venenosos podem ter sido usados para tirarem estes desafortunados do caminho mas se foi assim a experimenta o foi apenas incidental muitos alem es com quem tenho falado pensam que algum g s que desfigure o corpo tenha sido usado e esta seja a raz o real pela qual os restos das v timas tenham sido cremados mas n o posso obter evid ncia real disso

1837265 the fiscal policy of the state needs to be balanced through discipline
1837266 i know the economy is tough and people are worried but we believe the solution is to cut spending not look for new revenues
1837267 paterson could just go along with the easiest of easy fixes hiking taxes on the wealthy further pummeling the states battered economy
1837268 new york like most states is now facing an unenviable choice either taxes have to be raised or expenditures cut when faced with such an unpleasant choice economic theory and evidence gives a clear and unambiguous answer it is economically preferable to raise taxes on those with high incomes than to cut state expenditures
1837269 the reasoning is straightforward in a recession you want to raise or not decrease the total level of spending by households business and government in the economy
1837270 i really dont want to discuss the issue of taxes because as soon as you do it perpetuates the addiction

1837279 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1837280 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1837281 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1837282 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1837283 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1837284 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

1837289 several winners this year are relatively new such as the nissan rogue honda fit gmc acadia and saturn sky while others are a surprise such as the large light duty pickup and compact pickup winners the chevy avalanche and honda ridgeline the surprise is that neither of these are what would be considered regular trucks and therefore show their value to their owners
1837290 the absence of jeep chrysler and dodge vehicles is regrettable and parallels their current sales situation none of the vehicles from these brands rated particularly well within either autopacifics or intellichoice coms individual analysis
1837291 due to the economy and fuel costs more and more people who want a larger vehicle are focusing on crossover suvs rather than traditional suvs or gas guzzlers we added two new crossover segments highlighting this growing class of vehicle
1837292 in fact in our large crossover suv segment every vehicle is an all new release within the last 24 months the contenders for both new crossover suv segments are two of the closest categories
1837293 there were 44 outstanding vehicles scoring 700 or better last year only 25 vehicles scored above that standard which certainly speaks to the quality of vehicles being produced today some vehicles scored very well but didnt make the winners list due to other even higher scoring vehicles in their segment the premium luxury suv segment is a perfect example as there are ten vehicles in that segment and nine of them scored 700 or higher in fact the cadillac escalade topped the lexus gx by just four points

1837400 strong statistical data is essential in scotland if government and its agencies are to truly address the needs of black minority ethnic bme communities
1837401 garas state of the nation report seeks to address such requirements and will become an invaluable reference tool for policy makers
1837402 i wish to congratulate glasgow anti racist alliance for identifying the need for and producing the state of the nation document
1837403 i am confident that its publication will highlight any needs that must be addressed and make a real difference to black people
1837404 i welcome the production of this report which brings all the evidence on race and racism issues in scotland together in one place
1837405 the scottish government believes that a successful scotland is civilised fair and inclusive and provides equal opportunity and choice for all its people
1837406 i hope this report will be a useful tool in reaching this goal and contribute to making race equality a reality across the country
1837407 they move people all the time in the middle of the night i live in complete fear
1837408 at the headcount each morning there are new people who werent here the previous night most rooms have four beds and you wake up when they come for two maybe three of your room mates in the middle of the night
1837409 you wake up again when they bring the new people in some have been picked up from their homes but most of them moved from other detention centres i sleep in fear if you hear a noise at your door at night you are immediately wide awake and your first thought is they have come for me people who have been spirited away like this tell me they dont tell you what is happening they take you and you have to switch your phone off and you cant tell anybody what is happening
1837410 i couldnt send my two year old daughter a birthday card
1837411 i knew i couldnt send a present but it was very distressing not to be able to even send a card
1837412 we are in a worse position than prisoners if you were in prison you would have a sentence and know how long you were to be detained for you would have certain rights this is psychologically and emotionally very distressing
1837413 i would estimate that they move around 70 80 of detainees at night time
1837414 but the main reason why they transport so many at night is that unless they are in a police cell in the van the detainees are often hammering on the sides and shouting and if it was daytime imagine the outcry if a van like that pulled up at the traffic lights
1837415 we are justifiably concerned about detention limits of 42 days but these are people in our society detained without limit
1837416 this kind of activity increases the discomfort and distress of these innocent people who should be treated with dignity i cant see that driving people around at night is treating them with dignity none of the reasons given justifies the practice of people getting moved at night also families are only meant to be detained as a last resort but our research is that it is not a last resort
1837417 holding children in the back of a van for eight hours or more sometimes with no breaks or access to food or water transporting them and their parents far away from their lawyers and community networks is traumatic and inhumane at any time of the day
1837418 all immigration removal centres are operated in line with strict rules and are regularly inspected detention plays a vital role in maintaining an effective immigration control including the removal of those without any right to remain here and who refuse to leave the uk voluntarily

1837500 there are in the end three things faith hope amp love and the greatest of these is love
1837501 a cyborg is a cybernetic organism a hybrid of machine and organism a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction
1837502 the cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experiences that changes what counts as womens experience in the late twentieth century
1837503 nature and culture are reworked the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other
1837504 the main trouble with cyborgs of course is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchcal capitalism not to mention state socialism
1837505 biology an evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science within this framework teaching modern christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse
1837506 our machines are disturbingly lively and we ourselves frighteningly inert
1837507 so my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries potent fusions and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work one of my premises is that most american socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body animal and machine idealism and materialism in the social practices symbolic formulations and physical artifacts associated with high technology and scientific culture
1837508 there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women there is not even such a state as being female itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices gender race or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy colonialism and capitalism and who counts as us in my own rhetoric
1837509 the main achievement of moth marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labor to accommodate what some women did even when the wage relation was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labor under capitalist patriarchy
1837510 reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies one rooted in labor one in sex both calling the consequences of domination and ignorance of social and persona reality false consciousness
1837511 the actual situation of women is their integration exploitation into a world system of production reproduction and communication called the informatics of domination
1837512 communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies
1837513 the translation of the world into a problem of coding a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly reassembly investment and exchange
1837514 i want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work however there is no place for women in these networks only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to womens cyborg identities
1837515 we did not originally choose to be cyborgs but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of texts
1837516 the self is the one who is not dominated who knows that by the service of the other the other is the one who holds the future who knows that by the experience of domination which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self to be one is to be autonomous to be powerful to be god bur to be one is to be an illusion and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other yet to be other is to be multiple without clear boundary frayed insubstantial one is too few but two are too many
1837517 high tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways it is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine
1837518 why should out bodies end at the skin or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin
1837519 our bodies ourselves bodies are maps of power and identity cyborgs are no exception a cyborg body is not innocent it was not born in a garden it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end or until the world ends it takes irony for granted
1837520 the production of universal totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality probably always but not certainly now and second taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti science metaphysics a demonology of technology and so means embracing the skillful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life in partial connection with others in communication with all of our parts
1837521 perhaps power has to do with investments as much economic as unconscious
1837522 the legacy of the enlightenment is the call to think critically about the present to emphasize becoming over being and to practice what foucault calls a permanent critique of our historical era
1837523 cost enacts or dramatizes the effects of social compulsion and their imbrication with individual desires without any necessity for natural or transcendental backing if you want it you have to consider the price monetary or otherwise
1837524 the marxist project highlighted by foucault here is not the denunciation of capitalism as a misery machine but the project of mapping the myriad ways in which misery is produced by capital in the hopes that the machine can be modified to support a different series of outputs
1837525 foucaultian power is not something held but something practiced power is not imposed from above a system or socius there is no outside power no place untouched by power conversely there is no place of liberation or absolute freedom from power in the end power produces desires formations objects of knowledge and discourses rather than primarily repressing controlling or canalizing the powers already held by preexisting subjects knowledges or formations
1837526 foucault two uses for the word intensity to signal individual bodily pain and systematic saturation correspond roughly to what foucault calls the two images of discipline
1837527 if discipline discovers the body as powers primary pivot or relay disciplineary power also made that body the body becomes a useful force only if it is both a productive body and a subjected body
1837528 money deleuze writes perhaps best expresses the difference between the two kinds of society since discipline was always related to molded currencies containing fold as a numerical standard whereas control is based on floating exchange rates modulations depending on a code setting sample percentages for various currencies
1837529 in disciplinary societies you were always starting all over again as you went from school to barrackes from barrackes to factory while in control societies you never finish anything business training and military service being coexisting meta stable states of a single modulation a sort of transmutation of power
1837530 a whole political network became interwoven with the fabric of everyday life a whole vast network of confrontations and resistances is configured and deployed and that network confronts us every day all the time with increasing intensity welcome to amazon com jeffrey we have some suggestions for you
1837531 following the intense saturation of biopowers concepts and practices within everyday life contemporary capitalism has not gone about setting boundaries on work but rather has sought to increase works saturation into the very fiber of everyday life think of yourself at home answering e mail at midnight a highly intensified mode of biopower then is what one might call the operating system of contemporary economic and cultural life at least in the so called first world
1837532 in sum the critical history of thought is neither a history of acquisitions nor a history of concealments of truth it is the history of verdictions understood as the forms according to which discourses capable of being declared true or false are articulated concerning a domain or thing what the condition of this emergence were the price that was paid for it so to speak its effects on reality and the way in which linking a certain type of object to certain modalities of the subject it constituted the historical a priori of possible experience for a period of time an area and for given individuals

1837830 i love the pressure its pushing me to be a better player
1837831 as soon as i got here wright got on me telling me everything what to do how to do it and about the temp mostly
1837832 it helps me a lot he teaches me through his experiences
1837833 then the host schools will automatically advance to the sprint center in kansas city regardless of the results in the opening rounds the current expectation is that the nov 24 semifinals will pair uw against kansas and florida against syracuse
1837834 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
1837835 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
1837836 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
1837837 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
1837838 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent to buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
1837839 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
1837840 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year
1837841 no strings relationships have helped cure me of love addiction all my life ive been in long term monogamous relationships i had to break that pattern by not allowing myself to have a relationship for a year stopping myself from committing to men i havent been celibate ive had lots of dates and lots of sex but i havent been pushing to turn a date into a relationship this has been a huge thing for me
1837842 up to date results of floyd landis in the tour de france
1837843 ummm i already i have that one the knee here it is
1837844 if so why has god chosen to coexist with us in this format and under what would seem to be needlessly complicated circumstances
1837845 when you are working on a story you should eat breathe and sleep that story
1837846 quil ny avait aucune raison pour que nous ayons les prix les plus hauts deurope
1837847 oh yeah we dont get involved in who we choose to fuck
1837848 pedro this is a dead end job youre in right now you will never ever make any money here or go any further here
1837849 you should go work somewhere else because you are that good and you will never go any further here
1837850 there is no greater problem facing average americans and small business today than high fuel costs and our nations dependency on foreign oil
1837851 our proposal is not perfect but it is a bipartisan start on the road to a comprehensive energy strategy leading our nation to independence from foreign oil it will create new jobs from new technologies good for american wallets and our environment i am proud to be part of this bipartisan effort to address this serious problem
1837852 offshore drilling with the consent of the states is an integral part of any energy independence plan
1837853 there is no doubt we need more domestic exploration every barrel of oil we can find in america will be one less we have to compete with china and india for or be subject to opec price setting the more domestic energy we can locate and utilize the better
1837854 since the 1970s our country has had an irrational view of nuclear power
1837855 this view is best demonstrated by our nations refusal to allow recycling of spent fuel rods for decades the french japanese and british have all been recycling spent fuel surely this is an instance were we can be as bold as the french
1837856 our proposal also commits billions for research development and purchases of alternative fuel vehicles
1837857 we call for an apollo project like effort to support the goal of transitioning 85 percent of american new motor vehicles to non petroleum based fuels within the next 20 years
1837858 quite frankly this particular tax incentive was never asked for by the oil companies
1837859 it is irrational to be allocating around 1 billion per year in tax dollars to assist in production at a time when oil is 124 per barrel and companies are recording record profits
1837860 it is clear to the american people their congress is broken i appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to try to jumpstart serious discussions on how to solve americas energy crisis
1837861 it is my hope that this group will provide some reassurance to the american people that we still can work together and find common ground on the important problems facing every american family and business i hope that over the congressional recess support will build for this common sense balanced approach to making our nation more energy independent
1837862 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book

1837867 the first amendment is the most important amendment if they take that one away then you should start loading your weapons
1837868 there are folks in congress calling they want people under oath with threat of perjury
1837869 maguires sent me things about truth and the power of truth hes a believer in that i think richer is too and well see how it unfolds
1837870 no but i dont think he will be up anytime soon ill call in for an ambulance backup should be on the way too

1837892 die hohe teilnehmerzahl zeigt auf dass immer mehr menschen mit der politik des kabinetts nicht einverstanden sind mit ihrer kunstwerksendung fordern die menschen auch ein gr eres mitbestimmungsrecht in wichtigen gesellschaftlichen fragen denn der von frau merkel propagierte aufschwung kommt bei der mehrheit der b rgerinnen in unserem land nicht an

1837901 well why dont you just go there on vacation or something
1837902 we have made a great record its a unique sound what i thought was im not going to go the easy way here im going to fly over spend three days in warrington and make a vibe i believe aggression can and will go bananas for them its edgy to the point that it scares people
1837903 theres no one act that id say they remind me of theyve got their own thing going and thats what i like about them
1837904 i get asked to sing with a lot of bands but i am pretty picky who i sing with when the lads approached me i listened to their tunes and thought it all sounded really fresh top grooves and lyrics
1837905 when they said theyd like me to write the chorus to our dylan i had a listen and loved it straight away and came up with the idea after a few listens in the studio they were really into what id come up with so it was a great session with latch the producer at tuff gong theyve got the talent the tunes and the passion and theyre really good lads the reason liams lyrics are great is cos theyre from the heart
1837906 whatever a mind could conceive and believe a mind may achieve
1837907 i have never as a head coach put up a timetable
1837908 sometimes you go into a situation you have pretty good players there who are in disarray you straighten them out they get confidence and all of a sudden youre pretty good
1837909 you go into other situations where you may not have as many good players
1837910 its going to take a little more time to recruit your way out of it
1837911 i think a lot of guys now grasp what coach saban is saying
1837912 we have to focus on the process not on the results
1837913 hes pretty blunt about what he wants but thats what most players want from a coach
1837914 you dont want a coach who beats around the bush and never tells you what he thinks
1837915 our biggest focal points in the off season have been consistency and finishing games
1837916 last year we played up to the good teams and down to the bad ones and when we had big leads we couldnt keep them
1837917 we had lost our belief in our ability to win

1837920 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1837921 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1837922 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach

1837988 since the bush administration came to power it has been heading towards a presidential dictatorship whereby the waging of war abroad is accompanied by internal repression and attacks on democratic and civil rights at home we have seen nothing like these new laws since nazi germany the homeland security bill gives the president complete dictatorial powers he is able to make any decision he wishes without judicial or legislative restraint the executive branch can now carry on its meetings in secret without scrutiny from the press or the people
1837989 it is in the countries where the full fascist dictatorship has been established that the most complete organisation of the entire state for war has been realised it is against this most menacing war offensive of the present moment that the main fight needs to be directed at the present stage this situation gives certain possi bilities to the forces fighting for peace to utilise these contradictions in the imperialist camp in order to place obstacles in the way of the advance to war the working class must utilise as lenin repeatedly pointed out every factor and every differentiation however small in the camp of the bourgeoisie in order to further its aims in a given tactical situation

1837998 as salafi adalah sebutan bagi siapa saja yang berada di atas manhaj salaf
1837999 kemudian jika kalian berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul sunnahnya jika kalian benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagi kalian dan lebih baik akibatnya
1838000 tunjukilah kami jalan yang lurus jalannya orang orang yang telah engkau beri nikmat
1838001 mereka adalah orang orang yang mengetahui kebenaran dan berusaha untuk mengikutinya maka setiap orang yang lebih mengetahui kebenaran serta lebih konsisten dalam mengikutinya tentu ia lebih berhak untuk berada di atas jalan yang lurus dan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para sahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam mereka adalah orang orang yang lebih berhak untuk menyandang sifat gelar ini daripada orang orang rafidhah
1838002 dan barangsiapa menentang rasul setelah jelas baginya kebenaran dan mengikuti selain jalannya orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa bergelimang dalam kesesatan dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
1838003 para ulama telah menjelaskan tentang makna firman allah di atas sesungguhnya yang dimaksud dengan orang orang mukmin disini adalah para sahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan generasi pertama dari umat ini karena mereka merupakan orang orang yang menyambut syariat ini dengan jiwa yang bersih
1838004 dan sungguh keduanya menentang rasul dan mengikuti selain jalannya orang orang mukmin red adalah saling terkait maka siapa saja yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas baginya kebenaran pasti ia telah mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mukmin dan siapa saja yang mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mukmin maka ia telah menentang rasul sesudah jelas baginya kebenaran
1838005 dan orang orang yang terdahulu lagi pertama tama masuk islam dari kalangan muhajirin dan anshar serta orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik allah ridha kepada mereka dan mereka pun ridha kepada allah dan allah menyediakan bagi mereka surga surga yang mengalir di dalamnya sungai sungai mereka kekal abadi di dalamnya itulah kesuksesan yang agung
1838006 allah subhanahu wa taala mengkhabarkan tentang keridhaan nya kepada orang orang yang terdahulu dari kalangan muhajirin dan anshar serta orang orang yang mengikuti jejak mereka dengan baik dan ia juga mengkhabarkan tentang ketulusan ridha mereka kepada allah serta apa yang telah ia sediakan untuk mereka dari jannah jannah surga surga yang penuh dengan kenikmatan dan kenikmatan yang abadi
1838007 maka jika mereka beriman kepada apa yang kamu telah beriman kepadanya sungguh mereka telah mendapat petunjuk dan jika mereka berpaling sesungguhnya mereka berada dalam permusuhan dengan kamu
1838008 sesungguhnya barang siapa di antara kalian yang hidup sepeninggalku nanti maka ia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak
1838009 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam sebagaimana yang engkau saksikan telah mengiringkan sunnah al khulafa ar rasyidin dengan sunnah beliau dan bahwasanya di antara konsekuensi mengikuti sunnah beliau adalah mengikuti sunnah mereka yang demikian itu dikarenakan apa yang mereka sunnahkan benar benar atau mengikuti apa yang mereka pahami dari sunnah mengikuti sunnah nabi mereka beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam baik secara global maupun secara rinci yang tidak diketahui oleh selain mereka
1838010 terus menerus ada sekelompok kecil dari umatku yang senantiasa tampil di atas kebenaran tidak akan memudharatkan mereka orang orang yang menghinakan mereka sampai datang keputusan allah dan mereka dalam keadaan seperti itu
1838011 kalau bukan ahlul hadits maka aku tidak tahu siapa mereka
1838012 hadits ini merupakan tanda dari tanda tanda kenabian rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam di dalamnya beliau telah menyebutkan tentang keutamaan sekelompok kecil yang senantiasa tampil di atas kebenaran dan setiap masa dari jaman ini tidak akan lengang dari mereka beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam mendoakan mereka dan doa itupun terkabul maka allah azza wa jalla menjadikan pada tiap masa dan jaman sekelompok dari umat ini yang memperjuangkan kebenaran tampil di atasnya dan menerangkannya kepada umat manusia dengan sebenar benarnya keterangan sekelompok kecil ini secara yakin adalah ahlul hadits insya allah sebagaimana yang telah disaksikan oleh sejumlah ulama yang tangguh baik terdahulu ataupun di masa kini
1838013 umatku akan terpecah belah menjadi 73 golongan semuanya masuk ke dalam neraka kecuali satu golongan beliau ditanya siapa dia wahai rasulullah beliau menjawab golongan yang aku dan para sahabatku mengikuti
1838014 hadits ini sebagai nash dalil red dalam perselisihan karena ia dengan tegas menjelaskan tentang tiga perkara pertama bahwa umat islam sepeninggal beliau akan berselisih dan menjadi golongan golongan yang berbeda pemahaman dan pendapat di dalam memahami agama
1838015 wajib bagimu untuk mengikuti jejak salaf walaupun banyak orang menolakmu dan hati hatilah dari pemahaman pendapat tokoh tokoh itu walaupun mereka mengemasnya untukmu dengan kata kata yang indah
1838016 wajib bagimu untuk mengikuti atsar dan jalan yang ditempuh oleh salaf dan hati hatilah dari segala yang diada adakan dalam agama karena ia adalah bidah

1838046 the comfort zone is the place a church commonly falls into once they learn how to survive at this point the propensity is for the church to settle in accept its size and slip into a mode of maintenance at some point the people will move away or die others will get bored and slowly the church will begin a cycle of decline unless it intentionally reinvents itself missionally to continue to grow by taking risks in an effort to reach lost people for jesus

1838099 how much new oil will arrive then no one can say conclusively think in terms of one to two million barrels per day by 2025 2030
1838100 preliminary data shows us consumption is down a hefty 860 000 barrels per day in the first seven months of the year compared with the same period of last year nevertheless overall global oil demand is still rising thanks to china and the mideast and was up an estimated 540 000 b d in july
1838101 new offshore drilling would have no immediate effect on supplies or prices
1838102 there are millions of acres with a ton of oil already leased out to the oil companies and they havent drilled on them
1838103 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1838104 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
1838105 preliminary data shows us consumption is down a hefty 860 000 barrels per day in the first seven months of the year
1838106 so who says that once the oil is pumped that it will be sold to america and not china or someone else what insurance do we have arent they going to sell the oil to the open market

1838110 siente el amor que tienes por el padre porque el padre divino es el esp ritu de toda la creaci n excepto la madre divina y cuando este amor sea tan grande que ya no puedas contenerlo m s dentro de ti con tu intenci n d jalo irse a los cielos de nuevo puedes enviarlo dentro de una peque a esfera si as lo quieres

1838125 in an era when vintage metal t shirts are in vogue and bands worshiping at the altar of every crossover band that released a demo or ep in the 80s are crawling out of the woodwork la thrashers warbringer are cauterizing the competition with a sound that recalls all the classics without being derivative
1838126 before we even had this band we all had bought a bunch of metal albums released on cm so for us to be on this label that has had all these bands we like on it is just awesome
1838127 we try to keep our songs very compact and tend not have a ton of repetition thrash wise our primary influence is stuff like mid era sacrifice early slayer demolition hammer and kreator heavy and fast we often have an old school death metal undertone to our music as well

1838138 he was an amazingly consistent person and was a deeply religious writer in the literal sense of the word it is not so much that he wrote on religious themes but morality and ethics always had a place in his compositions solzhenitsyn gave his entire life to the people he greatly loved russia and never lost faith in the russian people he always called on russia to rise up off its knees probably he has done much more for russia than anyone else
1838139 is russia close to the one i dreamt of no far from it both in terms of its political system and in terms of its social and economic development certainly it scored good results on the international scene it has regained its influence and place in the world but our inner moral condition is a far cry from what we need we need moral education which cannot be attained by state efforts alone this is a most complicated process of spiritual growth
1838140 since liturgical worship is a direct expression of the faith participation in sacramental contact cannot be real and properly conducive to unity if it is not the fruit of the resolution of general dogmatic questions in other words liturgical contact is the outward expression of a general agreement in faith a visible element of an underlying unity if such is lacking it is not an expression of unity rather it is an example of syncretism
1838141 the laity with or without the blessing of the hierarchy must fulfil their duty they have a right to a correct announcement of the word and the church teachings and if someone tries to contravene this right of the laity then the voice of god may be found in that of the laity
1838142 any christian when the faith of our common confession is attacked has an obligation to defend it to the best extent of their ability without waiting for any special authorisation since the church does not have official advocates
1838143 a sophisticated rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity
1838144 if mankind was intended only for happiness as humanism proclaims at the same time it would not have been intended for death but as mankind is solidly doomed to death its earthly task is obviously more spiritual it is not confined to the grind of daily activity not merely enslaved to the most efficient method of obtaining things and their mindless enjoyment but to the bearing of a constant and difficult debt so that ones entire life becomes an experience of moral elevation enabling one to leave life at a higher spiritual level than one began it

1838157 when nye bevan made everything free in the nhs he designed in 1948 he knew what he was doing he took all health care completely out of the marketplace health care was no longer a commodity sold for profit and bought from fear it became a public service a gift from taxpayers when they were well to people with the misfortune to be ill from each according to his or her ability to each according to his or her need a first helping of socialism within which to learn how to behave in a new world of solidarity where people would co operate to help each other rather than compete in an endless battle to reach the top of a dungheap few people today remember that for the first five years or so of the nhs there were absolutely no charges for anything not only all prescriptions were free so were glasses eye tests and all dental care charges for these were re introduced not because this was necessary but to re establish the principle that nobody must ever have anything they havent paid for personally because even in attlees cabinet there were few real socialists then as now most of them paid more attention to what was said in the daily mail than the opinions of their voters when they re imposed charges bevan resigned the contribution made by prescription charges to the nhs is much smaller than most people think and there are other more effective alternatives one is to reduce wasteful and ineffective prescribing particularly of antibiotics for minor virus infections for which they are in any case ineffective and only help to develop resistant bacteria like the government is rightly campaigning to do this and the bma agrees with them another would be to renegotiate the prices of medications which are in many cases outrageous bearing no relation to their true costs of production at present pharmaceutical companies get a return of around 20 on their investments guaranteed by an agreement between them and the government which has never been fully disclosed to the public because of commercial secrecy mps should have tackled this long ago but in any case this is not the main point we need to keep our eye on the ball get back to the nhs as a gift economy our first installment of a better future where all of us move forward together instead of each one trying to get ahead of the rest

1838227 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1838228 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1838229 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1838230 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1838231 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1838232 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1838233 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable
1838234 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1838235 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1838236 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1838237 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1838238 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1838239 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1838240 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1838241 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1838242 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1838243 suskind said it took about seven months to get his storied
1838244 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1838245 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1838269 its a mind sport you have to keep reading up on new things it is essential to be a quizzer first and then a quizmaster only then will you be able to get the pulse of the crowd
1838270 an audience can make or break a quiz if you get a disconnect you have lost the audience immediately i always try to ask the most basic things but there should be some wow factor attached to it
1838271 specialised topics are more of a challenge to prepare as you have to hit the books and learn the subject only then can you prepare questions for an audience that knows its stuff

1838394 just a note to say thanks for the great weekend we got to get away from the stress and come back with some hope which was in short supply be sure and tell taylor and katie a big thanks for sharing their stories we were quite touched by that i hope god uses them in the lives of other troubled teens in some mentoring capacity as it is much needed
1838395 all is well so far and i wanted to let you know that we have started to implement the plan and ideas we learned from heartlight into our household so far so good and i am amazed at the response from our children we definitely have a long way to go with our daughter but i am confident the guidance we received from heartlight will help in the process of helping our daughter to make better choices we have already learned to stick to our guns and it seems to be paying off i will keep you posted and thank you so very much for all that mark jan and all of you at heartlight gave to me during a wonderful and enlightening weekend god bless
1838396 words cant fully express how much this past weekend meant to us
1838397 we appreciated the genuine and honest approach mark presented in parenting teens in todays culture

1838400 mark connected with parents right where they were every attendee of our seminar knew that mark could relate to what they were going through was a real blessing
1838401 i had such a wonderful time the conference was cozy and not sterile like many arena type conferences and i really felt like everyone there genuinely cared about our situations and really wanted to help us the two biggest things i got out of the seminar is one stop lecturing i am a big information person and i love to learn new things so when i talk with my older kids i always tell them why something isnt good for them or why people do what they do just wanting them to know the whys of things never intending to be bossy but just wanting to relay information having you tell us to always ask questions was huge i was never taught that i went home that night and took the kids out to dinner and only asked questions and i probably heard more out of my two teens mouths that night than the last two years put together i have had continued conversations with them since and it really works i am amazed and so grateful the second thing was marks phrase you cant do anything to make me love you more and you cant do anything to make me love you less part of my frustration as a mom was how much i love my kids try to teach them responsibility respect and to live and i tell them all every day if not twice how much i love them then they go and act like you dont it is so emotionally hurtful i loved learning how they view things why they do and that i need to reinforce that point so they feel safe to tell us anything i have said that every day to them since i got back and i am stunned at what they have come forth with that they were withholding before i cant thank you all enough we have been through so much trial and pain as a family and i know we have a long road ahead of us but you have given us hope for the future and i feel much better equipped as a mom now that i have tools to work with i never got them from my parents and want my kids to be able to do things differently from the get go when they have children thanks for the loving atmosphere and the warm welcome i have already recommended you up and down to others we cant thank you enough and will keep you updated

1838411 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1838412 the point was to feel sympathy for this man because he was in a tough position which yes but then theres also the fact that bills were still coming in and his wife was working at 2 or 3 jobs that werent even as good as the one the guy quit because it was beneath him and she wasnt even resentful about it because well bills have to be paid and she has to protect his male dignity and sense of self worth
1838413 a mans world but what did it mean that men whistled and stared and yelled things at you and you had to take it or you could get raped or beat up a mans world meant places men could go but not women it meant they had more money and didnt have kids not the way women did to look after every second and it meant that women loved them more than they loved the women that they could want something with all their hearts and then not

1838416 its her time to celebrate with her husband my daughter is a very family girl she loves children and i know that she and michael have been hoping for this for a long time
1838417 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god
1838418 depart from me i never knew you ye worker of iniquity
1838419 now the spirit is saying explicitly that in subsequent eras some will be withdrawing from the faith giving heed to deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons in the hypocrisy of false expressions
1838420 all have sinned scripture scripture scripture but christ came to die for sinners scripture scripture but those who reject christs sacrifice will be thrown into the lake of fire scripture from which there will be no salvation no scripture
1838421 in all the epistles speaking in them concerning these things in which are some things hard to apprehend
1838422 some things hard to apprehend which the unlearned and unstable are twisting as the rest of the scriptures also to their own destruction
1838423 the fruits of eternal life are daily birthed in our soul as we embrace gods government gods truth and gods spirit for it is by the yoke of his covenant that our faith is living and given direction for increase in him
1838424 het is droevig gesteld met het taalniveau als de spelling niet meer deugt of de leestekens niet meer goed staan valt de taal als loszittend lapwerk uit elkaar de reden dat het de moeite waard is om op te komen voor een goede interpunctie is niet dat het om een willekeurig notatiesysteem gaat dat alleen bekend is bij een stelletje overgevoelige elitairen die beginnen te krijsen als ze zien dat het systeem verkeerd wordt gebruikt of wordt genegeerd nee de reden is dat het niet mogelijk is om op een goede manier met elkaar te communiceren zonder leestekens leestekens geven aan welke woorden bij elkaar horen en welke niet leestekens wijzen erop hoe je een tekst moet lezen zoals de aanwijzingen in een muziekstuk duidelijk maken hoe het stuk gespeeld moet worden
1838425 de zinseindepunt is vooralsnog het eenvoudigst te begrijpen leesteken zolang iedereen tenminste snapt wat een zin is een voorwaarde die vandaag de dag niet meer gegarandeerd kan worden
1838426 ter nagedachtenis aan de stakende bolsjewistische drukkers van sint petersburg in 1905 eisten zij dat ze hetzelfde tarief betaald zouden krijgen voor leestekens als voor letters met hun staking gaven ze de directe aanzet tot de eerste russische revolutie
1838427 twee rechters die de oorspronkelijke tekst bekeken ontdekten met behulp van een microscoop toch twee leestekens die op een schuine streep leken de zogenaamde virgula die in 1351 de functie van de latere komma vervulde het opnemen van de strepen kommas in de tekst leidde tot een tekstinterpretatie die veroordeling tot de galg legitimeerde
1838428 ter nagedachtenis aan de stakende bolsjewistische drukkers van sint petersburg in 1905 eisten zij dat ze hetzelfde tarief betaald zouden krijgen voor leestekens als voor letters met hun staking gaven ze de directe aanzet tot de eerste russische revolutie

1838436 la pena de muerte es matar a alguien para demostrar que matar es malo
1838437 que el estado le pague el psic logo a la v ctima

1838440 que me atoro a un cabr n y me regresan aqui que es lo mismo que alla afuera nomas que aqui me mantienen

1838442 eres un gran pendejo y si merecen que se mueran esos cabrones igual y si alg n d a te violan elprieto a ver que haces
1838443 se or si fuer ami hija no estaria juzgando a ese cabron lo estarian velando
1838444 la raz n por la que debe de destruirse la pena de muerte reside en el hecho de que esta jam s ha reprimido el crimen ya que se comete cada d a al pie del cadalso en pocas palabras debe suprimirse esa pena porque no hay peor cosa que hacer morir a un hombre por haber matado a otro puesto que evidentemente siguiendo ese procedimiento en vez de tener un hombre menos tendrermos dos aritm tica que s lo puede resultar familiar a verdugos y a imb ciles
1838445 el asesinato para castigar el asesinato es tal vez lo que m s ofende a la sensibilidad

1838493 gods people are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the chief cornerstone
1838494 and in the church god has appointed first of all apostles second prophets third teachers then workers of miracles also those having gifts of healing those able to help others those with gifts of administration and those speaking in different kinds of tongues
1838495 but to each one of us grace has been given as christ apportioned it
1838496 when he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men
1838497 rabbi we know you jesus are a teacher who has come from god
1838498 in reading this then you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of christ which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the spirit to gods holy apostles and prophets
1838499 when he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men
1838500 when he ascended on high he gave some to be apostles some to be prophets
1838501 until we all become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ
1838502 the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth
1838503 rejoice over her o heaven rejoice saints and apostles and prophets god has judged her for the way she treated you
1838504 when morning came jesus called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them whom he also designated apostles
1838505 two or three prophets should speak and the others should weigh carefully what is said 32 the spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets 37 if anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted let him acknowledge that what i am writing to you is the lords command

1838542 the big advantage is there is no more hidden cost it was very deceiving sometimes it was a fairly sizable cost
1838543 it was really a student initiative they felt very strongly that the fees should be rolled into the entire tuition cost and youd know exactly what you would be paying
1838544 the fees were developed at times that there were freezes on tuition but costs were still going up
1838545 they were a way of addressing those costs there wont be nearly as many surprises and thats what we hope for
1838546 so there were students that would get financial aid and it would cover tuition but it would not cover say the 400 in fees
1838547 our stance is that it helps access to education because financial aid is now able to cover these fees
1838548 these are all recommendations that will be effective in fiscal year 2009 10
1838549 the educational stipend policy committee has completed their work and submitted a final version to me

1838583 get an idea of how the castle was supposed to look put together
1838584 theres a very small group of people who want to be amputees i think its
1838585 i decided that id be better as the opposite sex
1838586 i felt disassociated from my body and had tried killing myself multiple times
1838587 and with transpeople when they talk about it its not
1838588 i felt disassociated from my body and had tried killing myself multiple times
1838589 there is nothing about my looks i wouldnt change if i had a sudden magic wish and thats true of every moment ive lived even my confident ones
1838590 when i was skinny i wished i had big breasts so id look more womanly now that im busty i wish i had smaller breasts ive always been either too fat or too thin in my own opinion
1838591 and the reason that thought will never go away is because its true it doesnt matter how perfect a woman looks according to her cultures idea of perfection theres always something she can correct
1838592 not that cosmetic surgery is unknown among men of course but my impression i havent really studied it is that the vast majority of it is among men who have a career in which their appearance is important actors and models and such
1838593 thats probably not really the average guys perspective but i do think it is basically an extension of the standard masculine perspective on this
1838594 i have read about people who will consider themselves the opposite gender but dont want to go on hormones or have surgery maybe thats a slightly different condition from people who feel disassociated or alienated from their bodies
1838595 i could be wrong as i dont doubt that in general the cosmetic surgery industry wouldnt mind seeing men hating their own bodies as much as women often do and i think theyve made efforts in that direction but for the most part i think it hasnt really worked
1838596 they are what they are and generally it wouldnt even occur to most men to be anything other than content with that
1838597 in certain circles there may be expectations of a degree of muscularity and physical fitness though thats by no means universal as the example of bill gates illustrates but even thats more about the capability of the body than the appearance of it there are of course bodybuilders but i have the general impression that most men perceive them as missing the point one might say
1838598 unfortunately we can probably expect the beauty standard to move towards increasing degrees of unreality as it becomes more technologically possible to move it there
1838599 transgendered in that they identify more with the opposite gender but dont necessarily want to modify their bodies are going to get pressured to alter their bodies and also i dont think that our society is very accepting of peoples sexual characteristics not matching their gender
1838600 they focus especially on genitals the idea that they feel physically sick when they have to see or touch their male genitals
1838601 i do think that there is a quite intense lack of empathy within the trans rights circles towards born women our position in society our experiences our feelings towards ourselves and the self harm we do and are encouraged to do by the beauty industry starving and cutting ourselves up for example
1838602 i seriously doubted i fitted in to category woman because of dumb stuff like i didnt have a handbag and i find it hard to walk in heels symbols of femininity that we dont conform to make us doubt our claim to womanhood
1838603 youre female because no one would mistake you for a man
1838604 if you listen to some of the arguments and hierarchies among transpeople themselves theres an awful lot of who passes better who has better legs hair voice etc its pretty clear how much of an influence the beauty industry has there
1838605 my local hospital is notoriously terrible and underfunded i went past it yesterday and theyre having a cosmetic surgery open week come in for advice and free introductory sessions where you can sit down one on one to discuss your requirements presumably theyve identified cs as a possible way to bump up their bank account
1838606 it just seems very wrong to me this idea that someone is
1838607 well you were born wrong let us resculpt your body and personality to fit your new gender better
1838608 but when a number of people are suffering and at least some of the reasons for that can be traced to societal issues rather than individual illness then we need to view the problem from a wider viewpoint looking at what we are doing wrong as a culture to cause that suffering and making changes to stop it from happening
1838609 where a man wants to wear feminine clothing makeup behave in more feminine ways even choose a name he likes more than his own instead of saying
1838610 my dads right wing and he can much more readily accept that a feminine man is really a woman born wrong than what he might call a
1838611 were just expected to say okay yeh there is such a thing as
1838612 but i dont believe this thing you are claiming to experience is the actual thing you are saying it is i think it is something else
1838613 you are so hateful for calling transwomen crazy i cant believe you are so afraid of transwomen that now you are calling us maniacs
1838614 im just saying it is anguish inducing to me that what v talked about above is the case we make individuals a problem to be surgically and pharmaceutically
1838615 it still remains that people often react badly to hearing things they dont want to hear and take things that are not personal attacks to be personal attacks just because it doesnt feel good to hear whatever it just was that was said
1838616 theres a fair amount of ideology motivating my reaction to the thought of things like breast implants or surgery to alter the appearance of the genitals
1838617 by my way of thinking i still wouldnt actually have the female body i should have had i would just have a surgically altered version of the same body i was inappropriately born into
1838618 even if you dont fit some strict patriarchal definition of what a woman is and maybe by that definition theres something
1838619 i really do find it really insulting being told that after this life that i am actually privileged in terms of my sex and gender that i have never had any issues with my gender because i never wanted a sex change
1838620 being ignored and repeatedly told that all radfems uk fems feminists are in fact middle class
1838621 all former or current sex workers have to think this way and if they dont then theyre not or theres something wrong with them theyre crazy angry weak damaged etc
1838622 all working class or nonwhite feminists must agree with me be sex positive
1838623 id feel that i wouldnt really have that part of me back id have a simulacrum of it
1838624 when it comes to women who are sterile though that part of being a woman is closed off to them it doesnt make them any less female and i wouldnt want to meet someone who held that the ability to have children was so much the essence of womanhood that sterile women didnt count as real women somehow
1838625 i think the outlook of radical feminists in general is that gender is a matter of perception first and foremost not anatomy the reason for the controversy over transwomen among some radical feminists i believe isnt so much their anatomy as that they were raised as men and lived as such for a large part of their lives
1838626 i dont know if its even possible to envision it but do you have any idea of what you would do if social pressure wasnt a consideration
1838627 2 were you referring to radical feminists claiming that transwomen all believe in the biological difference or to radical feminists believing it themselves either way its again deeply essentialist
1838628 the most pernicious ideology on the face of the earth
1838629 a reaction against the opprobrium thrown at women without children whether it was because of not being able to or choosing not to was some of the impetus for the
1838630 its basically setting up a standard of what is a
1838631 i feel like i have not paid enough attention to understand why things got as ugly as they did
1838632 i wish that it were possible for two candidates to have the regular old fashioned rivalry running against each other thing and for people to like whoever they liked
1838633 im not glad that you were feeling the emotions you talked about in this post i wish that there were no cause for them but gosh i was glad to see a post again from you here
1838634 i was always hopeful for clinton and all the attacks and cheating has just made me much more so
1838635 the woman with aspergers you quoted in your most recent post shes a friend of mine
1838636 its just really hit me upside the head that while this faction fights with this faction and so on when it comes right down to it for most of them no matter how much they dont like each other its fundamentally menz menz menz its all about the menz
1838637 im getting this sense that womens issues are being marginalized even within feminism
1838638 that reminds me of the post at fniste where theyd just been bashed for their poor coverage of racism and then their racism post is about a black man and how thats a feminist issue
1838639 because mainstream feminism is all about making womens liberation attractive to men welcoming men
1838640 but a feminist issue would be to bring up a woman whos not going to get any kind of coverage to her case anywhere else but at the feminist blogs
1838641 i mean these women im seeing who are so damn glib just have this smooth little patter down thats so totally dismissive of other women and you cant even penetrate through to make them see how much theyre marginalizing other women giving men credit just for having a pulse but holding women to tehse transcendental standards of unearthly perfection
1838642 apparently anti sexwork radical feminism is racist imperialist and transphobic this is because white privileged inexperienced radfems are telling woc women in poorer countries what they should do moralizing their behaviour and because transpeople are over represented in the sex industry so they just hate transpeople
1838643 hey its fine for young black women to feel proud of being beautiful and almost naked in public
1838644 youre just jealous youre not a hot 17 year old
1838645 i cant be the bad guy cuz look someone else is being the bad guy at me
1838646 some white women are threatening to vote for mc cain if clinton doesnt win the nomination
1838647 i dont know this is kind of why ive stepped out of the blogosphere lately because its just given me a lot of unproductive anger and resentment
1838648 this is because white privileged inexperienced radfems are telling woc women in poorer countries what they should do moralizing their behaviour
1838649 this is because they found a comment on the forum reccomending a susan brownmiller book which must mean that said person is a radical feminist and or that radical feminists go to that board
1838650 but of course hes sex positive and though he may have some bad qualities hes still a good friend ally
1838651 they had very similar experiences to women in prostitution with high rates of ptsd and abuse and all that
1838652 so i read the discussion on ageism at sylvias blog and i gotta say wow joan it was quite interesting to see someone accuse you of doing exactly what their blogfriends do
1838653 i am really pissed off by the argument everywhere that older women somehow owe obama their votes or theyre responsible for teh conditions of the country
1838654 meanwhile this same person commented on my blog at the thread about a high school girl being turned away from her prom for wearing too skimpy of an outfit and my post was about how fucked up it is that people were calling this child a whore who was trying to get pregnant and what a horrible brat she was and all this shit
1838655 hey its fine for young black women to feel proud of being beautiful and almost naked in public
1838656 it makes sense that transpeople are over represented in prostitution as they are pretty marginalized in society particularly youth and poc
1838657 because doncha know us jungle bunnies have this unrestrained sexuality that looks suspiciously like racial fetish novels written by white people and them white middle class puritans is always coming along trying to harsh our vibe and make us all sedate when we want to groove to our drums and our jungle rhythms
1838658 i dont know if im being obnoxious or not in my confrontational ness
1838659 the poor old me person chimed in on that thread at my place to basically be like
1838660 ive had an ass full of hippie era folks claiming authority and elder ness
1838661 like it was about him thinking hes approximating the way a woman of color would chastise a white woman like thats how and particularly he seemed to be only thinking of black women not just any women of color black women talk when theyre mad
1838662 like it sure does make for good inflammatory copy to
1838663 some white women are threatening to vote for mc cain if clinton doesnt win the nomination
1838664 somewhat smug and appropriating white dude scolding unnamed white women on behalf of black women
1838665 to be clear i dont mean that they naturally are more likely to be involved in it just that if you notice the patterns with prostitution you see that the more dis advantaged people are in society its more likely they have fewer options opportunities like fn women here
1838666 and i mean the thing is white men are almost never the friends of women of color so i think we should be careful about allying ourselves with them
1838667 i left a comment at the public blog awhile ago about one of the biggest studies of sexual behavior internationally it found that people in stereotypically white anglo countries like norway and australia tend to start having sex earlier and have more sexual partners
1838668 but i have to say i do understand why some would vote for mccain even though they do not wnat him as president because in teh nature of our system if stopping obama and his supporters from turning this party into something they don wnat voting for mccain is liek 2 votes against that rather than one it depends on what ones priorities are and we all have different ones
1838669 how much of teh dialogue of transpeople is wealthy transpeople who are not sex workers who are projecting their rah rah sex pos feelings onto economically disadvantaged transpeople in that actual position who dont necessarily share the same rah rah feelings
1838670 i certainly understand how transpeople wouldnt feel particularly enamoured with radical feminism but to just follow the sex pos stance seems a little i dont know silly
1838671 i love teh cock especially when it comes with only teh 20
1838672 i dont want to be miserable in a job i hate and spend more time at it than i spend at this one
1838673 i really cant think of anything else id rather do for money as a job part or full time besides sucking cock for a ten spot all day in cars and in my apartment
1838674 dear crystal how do i convince my girlfriend to get a brazilian wax if she says she doesnt want one
1838675 i certainly understand how transpeople wouldnt feel particularly enamoured with radical feminism but to just follow the sex pos stance seems a little i dont know silly
1838676 i used to feel like i had to at least keep up to date on what was being said on the big mainstream liberal and or liberal feminist sites but no longer given that id rather not turn into a complete misanthrope if i can help it
1838677 point being i liked making money as a 16 year old and as far as a dysfunctional 16 year olds point of view went it was a bitchin place to work ha imagine though if my feeling that way had been used against me by him with all kinds of people backing him publicly to say that the humiliation he caused me the times he made my little 16 year old ass fucking cry all the harm that went down there imagine if my thinking it was cool to work there and still wanting the job were used to say that a grown man doing all those things were therefore mitigated or must not have even really happened or at any rate werent that bad that only people who were trying to put me and other fast food workers out of work completely would insist that it was bad
1838678 im looking around my friends room for something to read last night while im waiting for him to finish playing world of warcraft
1838679 when it comes to obama as a person and a candidate though my impression is quite strongly negative
1838680 but to actively identify themselves with feminism and be participants within feminist spaces
1838681 imagine if my thinking it was cool to work there and still wanting the job were used to say that a grown man doing all those things were therefore mitigated or must not have even really happened or at any rate werent that bad that only people who were trying to put me and other fast food workers out of work completely would insist that it was bad
1838682 but pro misogynist cheerleaders want to insist that theres nothing unacceptable about someone having two shitty options about most people having shitty options for work for what work is like and then the people who can and or will make money doing sex as a job are no fucking kidding framed as lucky luckier than the rest of us schmucks who are stuck at a desk for 10 bucks an hour
1838683 i have nothing to add but look im still alive
1838684 even in my non illegal socially acceptable job i dont really like it but in general im careful to say that i do in case it gets back to the management
1838685 that was one of teh first arguments i ever saw on line and i could not believe it all work is dehumanizing and exploitative so it doesnt matter and wouldnt it be great to have orgasms at work at that point i knew that person was well off had an advanced degree and a fabulous career
1838686 does any other job require you to have your body invaded 30 times a day and mayyyyybe some people are not comfortable with that
1838687 hey im going to pay you more if you touch gross things and potentially poison yourself but dont wear gloves
1838688 but then we have overprivileged people telling less privileged people to not be victims and thats just callous as hell it just reeforces teh eprception that if something abd happens to you or you dont have teh resources or strength or whatever to get out of a situation completely on your own its your fault
1838689 it is too damn hard to sanitize an industry where the degradation and dirt and harm is the point of it not some byproduct
1838690 and its just so arrogant telling people what to feel
1838691 yeah has anyone ever had the experience of having a problem and having someone else say dont be a victim or get over it and felt that that was helpful give me a break everyone knows how that feels it feels like being slapped down
1838692 capitalism pits money against humans and says money comes out on top importance wise the sex industry pits womens humanity against mens right to access our bodies and says that mens right to access our bodies comes out on top
1838693 also pardon me if this is repetitive and or re stating the obvious but saying that everybodys jobs are exploitative in some way is an argument against capitalism not an argument for the sex industry
1838694 im interested to know if the libertarian pro prostitution types think that its ok for people to sell or rent via surrogacy their organs
1838695 they act like theyre soooo radical then its like work is exploitative solution do nothing dont make waves accept that exploitation is good and when it comes to teh sex industry its very good
1838696 id bet they defend those things on free market grounds too
1838697 i can kind of see the socialist angle of it for some of them if they favor strict government regulation of prostitution
1838698 theyre more like no regulation of anything youre restricting our freedom and being paternalistic from wha ive seen
1838699 kyle payne has served as a womens rights advocate and is the only man elected to the board of now
1838700 wont stop whining about said crushing burden long enough to actually listen to women
1838701 alpha male assholes wholl attach themselves to any movement that happens to come along and use it as justification for a series of sub primate dominance rituals
1838702 genuinely do believe that women are sacred virginal moon goddesses who are always right about everything apart from
1838703 your post was well written and raised many pertinent issues but if i may play devils advocate
1838704 well kyle payne has not been convicted therefore you cannot call him a rapist
1838705 shut up while im empthasising with you barges into discussions and wont leave even when asked reaches crisis point when he starts insisting that he doesnt actually have male privilege and its not fair to consider him male after all the work hes put in so he should be allowed in women only discussions i know because i saw it happen and the latter half is especially ironic as he was a raging transphobe
1838706 was that pfm because i remember some women being annoyed at him for saying that feminism must include violence
1838707 who are all these crazy people who think you are evol lm
1838708 yeah he wanted to serve feminism by kicking misogynists in the face when they treated women badly i also ran into a lot of guys like that a few years ago when i was involved in anti globalisation stuff
1838709 i confess to violent impulses myself however temporary certainly got one last week when i heard about the man in my city who raped a four year old he was babysitting and she ended up in serious condition in the hospital having major surgery and probably maimed permanently
1838710 also it would not surprise me if that guy like most rapists who dont commit rape along with another crime like murder does zero time and ends up living a pretty good life
1838711 can i just say that i have officially banned myself from ever trying to comment on the sites of anybody who writes a blog that people from either side of the sex wars fights each other on
1838712 but every time that i read or hear about that next kid who got raped that next dead battered spouse who had just left him the next i think how can i be so certain that armed resistance would not change things
1838713 well fuck it then i will just start rebelling by being purposefully offensive that is the solution
1838714 i just mean that sometimes i see where i am obsessive about what i think people think of me and trying to control it i gotta let shit go
1838715 you disagree with someone one day and before you know it theres multiple and horrible blog posts going out personally attacking everything the writers imagine you to be scary blogworld
1838716 how can you have agency in choosing sex work in other words while simultaneously claiming no responsibility for that agency that you are exercising seems incongruent to me
1838717 have you all been following the post at rage against the manchine about sex positive men did you think that the picture she posted is racist its still at hearts
1838718 misogynist because the pole dancer is blonde and therefore apparently mocks blondes for being bimbos
1838719 oh the radfems are being bad people and its our job to prove that we are better people than the uss by never acting bad
1838720 when i first saw it i did think some of these faces look like they are drawn intentionally exaggerated to imply different types of ethnicities which weirded me out some
1838721 mens entitlement to purchase womens bodies is for me anyway the main and really the only point about the sex industry when it comes to nailing whats horrible about it
1838722 stuff like when g mar brought up res broken noses as a commentary on the sex industry being harmful
1838723 i dont really like to see caricatures of women being pathetic which i feel like that stripper cartoon kind of is
1838724 i got the impression that ak at least was saying that even suggesting black men get off on womens oppression and exploitation is racist
1838725 so those are my feelings about the cartoon issue and ah one last thing about it i dont really like to see caricatures of women being pathetic which i feel like that stripper cartoon kind of is its hard for me not to feel basically kind of protective of the humanity of all women including and sometimes even especially women who are the most vulnerable which anyone who is not very bright and is stripping and is believing that its this great thing its hard to get much more vulnerable than that i dont think confronting women about this stuff is bad or mean at all i just think there is a difference between confrontation and outright mockery and mockery is something men do so much including to women in the sex industry that it is hard for me to embrace it as a good time let alone a politically effective tactic
1838726 giving creepy ass black men like ak a free pass to get off on womens oppression as much as he wnats is what i mean by racial progress
1838727 if he chooses to get off on the oppression of white women and leave asiana nd latino and black women alone well then thats a two fer
1838728 and what i found so disturbing about it is that the ambert alert would say this is for these 4 kids describe teh kids describe the man and then add
1838729 well all these women including the woc are racist and deserve it
1838730 i need to write something about the issue of nonwhite men who exploit white women but im kind of scared because its so controversial
1838731 a lot of feminist blogs have written about how even pre adolescent female victims are often accused of being
1838732 i listened to the lyrics that ludacris used in this song 1 i am a man i am not offended
1838733 nobody would think it was okay for white women to treat to black men the way ak and some of these other guys treat talk to about white women and asian women and latina women and well any other woman who doesnt please them on the excuse
1838734 yes and im sure this guys wife will be blamed for marrying him no leaving him soon enough
1838735 or maybe that is the reason that i thought he was white
1838736 yeah even though i do think that most of the white feministstm are racist
1838737 but virtually no moc care about feminist issues nor does anyone give a damn that they do not the extent that they care about feminist issues is a white man hurting a woc but they do not have to care if it is a moc hurting anyone and even less so if its a white woman being hurt
1838738 if i ordered a moc to pay attention to issues that mostly affect white women he would laugh in my face
1838739 its because hes creepy and disgusting and the personification of male privilege he sounds exactly like the worst white guy of them all so there
1838740 of course we need to call the on it but are they more racist than white men are they like the most racist people in the entire world do they control the universe and are they using their vast evil power to thwart the end of racism and happy happy equality for all
1838741 its gotten way the hell out of hand to the point where its just one big circlejerk for white men and moc to dump on women act like assholes and pat themselves on the back
1838742 every social justice issue in the world is a feminist issue just because every man has a mother or a wife or daughter and it makes women responsible for all issues at the expense of issues that only affect women that you can be damn sure nobody else is going to bring attention to
1838743 yes moc could do a hell of a lot more in terms of giving a rats ass about womens issues as well
1838744 but in my experience and not just online an awful lot of moc are pretty damn rude to and about white women play oppression olympics and act like theyre just spoiled pampered princesses who have zero problems etc you know all teh things hat white women get in trouble for when they do the same things to moc
1838745 probably most of it comes from white mens mommy or medea complexes and mocs internalized misogyny and outrage that any woman should have a higher status than them
1838746 yeah and that is what so many people seem to think antiracism is all about
1838747 why arent older white women selling their homes to have enough money to make a career out of defending michelle obama
1838748 its not ok for a woman of any color to actually hate men except in certain fringe y radical feminist circles particularly if shes privileged but on the other hand it is absolutely alright for men of any color to hate women
1838749 i dont think very many of them seem to get that not all white women are blonde thin pretty heterosexual rich able bodied etc
1838750 im sorry but am i higher or lower on the hierarachy than hillary rodham clinton oh yeah thats right so im sure a teeming hatefest aganst one of the most powerful wealthiest wmen in the us will come back to pay great dividends for me
1838751 its not just sexism against hrc that matters but sexism itself and how it affects so many women
1838752 im sorry older white women have been treated like absolute crap now its somehow their responsibility to devote all their energy into defending someone who went around saying things like if she cant run her own house how can she run the white house yeah wow its mysterious why that isnt like absolute top of the priority list number one issue in world
1838753 like where you had that girl and her boyfriend making those remarks we discussed at length before i mean im a young woman and that disturbs me i think of some young brash hotshot guy like the type that harasses me harassing an old lady while his girlfriend looks on and giggles im sure thats unfair especially to her but is like a little empathy
1838754 can you give me 50 because you love me and i love you
1838755 please forgive me that ive just totally flipped the fuck out at you and forget that i ever said any of that
1838756 and now here is my secret a very simple secret it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
1838757 ill move to cali with you only if we can live on a boat

1838779 ive enjoyed the new challenge of helping us continue to grow and put processes in place that will allow us to have what i would call sustained growth
1838780 at the same time shore up what i would call a good foundation to make it stronger so ive been busy
1838781 currently i oversee all the business and financial operations for the department
1838782 i have taken on the human resources responsibility for the department all the contracts human resources paperwork and then actually getting all the new staff members onboard and acclimated so that they literally can get set up and start working
1838783 she is very qualified and will assist us as we look to improve the condition of our athletics
1838784 i am looking forward to working with those coaches in a more direct manner and being able to hopefully assist them in meeting their program goals and hopefully exceeding those goals that we have for them
1838785 they are a student and an athlete representing the entire student body and we want them to make everyone proud with their performance both on and off the field
1838786 her shoes will never be filled because teri did so many things for the university that everyone jokes she probably bleeds green
1838787 sometimes the steps will be a little smaller and sometimes the steps will be a little larger than hers were
1838788 but ive got a good example and a good compass of the direction we need to go
1838789 one of the reasons why this position was attractive to me is the quality of life that is present here
1838790 portland has all the arts all the outdoors the ocean and the mountains are an hour away and it has a reasonably mild climate year round
1838791 it has been a great way to meet a lot of different people
1838792 my goal is to break 100 by the end of the summer
1838793 the only confession of the early christian church was jesus is lord
1838794 to make that confession cost many people their lives because of its radical claim
1838795 and so for somebody in one of our workshops to question the incarnation is simply very painful for me
1838796 i have known john killinger to be a popular presbyterian preacher he was a professor at samford university but we had no idea that his views on christ were what he declared in this breakout session his perspective is deeply troubling to me
1838797 can a blind man lead a blind man will they not both fall into a pit 40 a student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher
1838798 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
1838799 to be clear im not saying that all or perhaps even most persons and churches involved with the cbf are not true christians or even true baptists im confident that many cbfers are my brothers and sisters in christ some are uninformed or ill informed about the willingness of the organization to coddle and promote heretics while others fail to understand the gravity of such coddling and promotion even while rejecting such heresy
1838800 still there is no other reasonable alternative evaluation of an organization that regularly permits encourages advocates entertains condones sponsors and coddles heretics of the likes of john killinger at some point one has to conclude the organization can no longer be considered meaningfully christian
1838801 most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them
1838802 the truth is inseparable from who you are yes you
1838803 i am the way and the truth and the life
1838804 these words of jesus are one of the most powerful and direct pointers to truth if understood correctly

1839032 this book is an excellent introduction to the history of
1839033 the african american caste system when you think about the caste system you think of the poor in countries like india where there is a division of society based on differences of wealth inherited rank or privilege profession occupation or race but unfortunately back in the fifties there was a definite division between the negro working class communities and the more achieved and affluent black bourgeoisie in america the 400 refers to the upper class black community or the social elite many formed groups you may be familiar with such as jack and jill the links and the fraternities and sororities at black colleges and universities chasing the 400 a novel by first time author sheilah vance is a humorous spin on this sociological phenomenon i discovered this book at the harlem book fair this summer and was drawn to the colorful cover set in the 1950s in philadelphia vance tells the hilarious story of the marshall family and their friends and neighbors the main characters are vera marshall and her younger brother bobby vera and bobby are the oldest children of the local plumber on philadelphias main line along with his weary wife they are raising their ten children in a single row house in the low income section of town vera and bobby have hopes and dreams of moving past their parents dull existence and making good on their own vera wants to be a high fashion model and bobby dreams of going to college and becoming a scientist but the powers that be do nothing to help them on their journey instead they continue to put roadblocks in their path the story opens with vera and billy as students in the local high school which is predominately white but well attended by the sons and daughters of the doctors lawyers and other professionals on the main line the main line is a suburban community right on the outskirts of philadelphia the snobby black teenagers treat vera and billy even worse than the white students and vera is determined to leave them behind in a gust of smoke as she moves into her high living life after graduation the tale that unfolds is full of laughs and good times i really enjoyed this book it was such a fun read vera is a true diva i really liked the way the author developed this character shes well dressed a real beauty and loves the finer things in life vera is also determined smart and takes no prisoners as she hob nobs among the movers and shakers to make her way to the top her brother bobby is more reserved a real intellectual who eventually finds his niche in local politics you will enjoy the family connections as well as the portrayal of the closeness of the black community the author also did a great job with the setting and from her descriptions you could just imagine philadelphias affluent black community back then if you are looking for an upbeat novel to relax with after a stressful week at the office chasing the 400 is the book for you although there were a few serious moments i laughed all the way through this novel

1839046 erin hope you are well just got this and i wanted to say thank you as i am flattered that you all would copy us i am kind of surprised that the rpof would try to make an issue out of anyone taking vacations or vacating duties while floridas families are suffering when charlie crist has taken a record 44 days off as of 2 weeks ago charlie takes so many days off i have trouble keeping count that count courtesy of the orlando sentinel does not include the 49 days of throwing 1st pitches ect it also doesnt include his 250 000 junket to europe touring buckingham palace and sipping lattes at cafes across paris as florida economy tanked i am sure you saw the st pete times and miami herald articles reporting that under charlie crists administration florida is in recession for the 1st time in 16 years we lead the nation in job losses and we are 2 in foreclosures as i am sure you know the house democrats have put forward 13 major proposals that would increase supply reduce prices protect consumers and transition america to a clean renewable energy independent future each time a majority of house republicans have voted against these proposals you might also know that president bush rejected the republicans request to call a special session of congress you should also read up on barack obamas energy plan which provides immediate relief to families and makes the investment in alternative fuels needed to end our addiction to foreign oil obama has been very supportive of such moves unlike john mccain who during his 26 years in congress has repeatedly voted against such investments in alternative fuels maybe that is why big oil has donated 2 million to mccains campaign of course it could also be because mccain wants to give them 4 billion in tax breaks despite record profits or maybe it is just because 33 of mccains top staffers are lobbyists for the oil industry just wondering has your chairman told the governor yet that republicans get up and go to work eric

1839051 from an unlikely group of california donors a mechanic from d amp d auto repair in whittier the manager of rite aid pharmacy no 5727 the 30 something owners of the twilight hookah lounge in fullerton
1839052 incorrectly identified a rite aide manager and two twilight hookah lounge owners as being among the donors sargeant solicited on behalf of mccain those donors rite aid manager ibrahim marabeh and the lounge owners nadia and shawn abdalla wrote checks to former mccain rival rudy giuliani and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton not mccain
1839053 the law forbids high level supporters from writing huge checks with help from friends in the middle east and the former chief of the cias bin laden unit who now serves as a consultant to his company sargeant has raised more than 100 000 for three presidential candidates from a collection of ordinary people several of whom professed little interest in the outcome of the election
1839054 it looks like some of those contributions were not on the up and up
1839055 the bigger point the story makes is that theres going to a lot of times when mccain is kind of hauled down by a lot of these donors and a lot of the people who are around him

1839215 people sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs rather than as persons to be loved and cherished how easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality without regard for modesty self respect or the moral values that bring quality to human relationships this is worship of a false god instead of bringing life it brings death
1839216 maybe immodestly dressed older women think that theyre beyond the age of posing a temptation and maybe they are
1839217 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians
1839218 the use of a single one size fits all value for the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 obscures important differences associated with transmission cofactors perhaps more importantly the particular value of 0001 i e one infection per 1000 contacts between infected and uninfected individuals that is commonly used seems to represent a lower bound as such this value substantially underestimates the infectivity of hiv 1 in many heterosexual contexts heterosexual infectivity can exceed 01 one transmission per 10 contacts for penile vaginal contact or even 03 one transmission per three contacts for penile anal contact claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists
1839219 improved infectivity estimates especially more detailed estimates that quantify the amplifying effects of biological cofactors will help us to grasp the magnitude of the hiv epidemic accurately communicate the level of risk involved in heterosexual sex and identify the best possible intervention strategies for slowing the epidemics spread
1839220 infectivity studies are very difficult to conduct and that few studies exist as a result many of the studies producing the published estimates suffered from at least one potential bias therefore while our study documents the considerable heterogeneity of the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 and provides some explanations for this heterogeneity considerable uncertainty remains
1839221 slow food is good clean and fair food we believe that the food we eat should taste good that it should be produced in a clean way that does not harm the environment animal welfare or our health and that food producers should receive fair compensation for their work and that all people should have access to this good and clean food

1839226 after being honorably discharged from the army my wife and i had to make a decision as to where we would raise our young family erie was an option new jersey was an option because i had been accepted for seminary at princeton we decided on warren because her family is from michigan and i thought the metro detroit area would provide us with the best opportunities in terms of securing a job
1839227 we were preaching on participation within the church community that the practice of ones faith was not restrained within the four walls of a church building as i was encouraging my congregation to get out of the pews and particiapte i found my own desire to think bigger outside of the box grow as well after praying about the opportunity i realized that god could use me my voice and my talents while running for congress thats really how it all began
1839228 the number one issue is jobs what most people dont realize though is that jobs are a direct result of investment within the communities when we invest in new technologies when we invest in job training when we invest in finding solutions to our problems such as green energy or a better hybrid vehicle the jobs follow and in our district we have the man power and trade skill to put those investment dollars to work whoever is the representative for this district needs to do some networking and marketing to make it all happen
1839229 i have six living grandparents and i love them dearly what were not talking about and we need to have this discussion is the tsunami of baby boomers who will soon be depending on social security and other forms of government aid but when you look at the budget were broke our nation is virtually bankrupt and we need to start getting our priorities straight over the next 15 years the number of people of the age of 50 will grow by 75 percent and the number of people under the age of 50 will grow by just one percent this is a serious problem and its not being talked about at all

1839236 under the new laws every single heavy truck driver in new south wales will need to keep a work diary showing their working hours and rest breaks even if they only work a few hours a day in their local area
1839237 its just one of the changes in the new laws every trucking operator will need to understand what they involve and the best way to get support is to join an industry association like ata nsw
1839238 the nsw government hasnt released the final details of the laws there hasnt been enough training and there isnt a single highway in the state with enough rest areas
1839239 queensland and south australia have just announced a six month transition period the new south wales government needs to follow suit and announce a transition period for operators in this state as well
1839240 perdita di potere dacquisto delle retribuzioni di 3 5 milioni di dipendenti
1839241 quanto previsto nella manovra osserva il sindacalista e probabilmente confermato nella legge finanziaria rappresenterebbe solo quanto necessario per coprire linflazione programmata 1 7 per il 2008 e 1 5 per il 2009 quando allo stesso tempo il governo certifica che a fine 2008 linflazione sar pari al 3 4

1839243 quanto ai 200 milioni di euro di cui parla il ministro brunetta forse occorre ricordare allo stesso ministro e al governo che quelle risorse per legge e per le dichiarazioni dellesecutivo sono destinate alla sola riduzione parziale dei tagli alla sicurezza introdotti con il decreto 112 non si possono vendere due volte le stesse risorse

1839295 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1839296 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1839300 id skip the supernova just go to wally world and buy the 5 00 led light upgrade for the mini mag batteries last 10 times longer and the light is a whiter white not a yellowish hue
1839301 i saw maglite now has a 3 watt led mini maglite so i picked up one
1839302 im not so concerned about brighter but whiter would make it a whole lot better the color from the regular incandescent mini maglite is kind of yellowish orange which makes a lot of stuff seem like copper i had considered buying the nova light source until i saw this post by drano38 about a 3 watt led version of a mini maglite it solves the problem of the regular incandescent bulb having a yellowish color that makes copper hard to see the led light is very white thanks drano38 this is one of the best tips on this site i was considering buying the hawkeye xenon supernova light to get rid of the yellow color of the standard lamp but the led mini maglite does the same thing for 200 less home depot has the led mini maglite for for less than 24 now the copper looks like copper and the stainless doesnt

1839399 whoever believes and is baptised will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned
1839400 god was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe
1839401 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith
1839402 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
1839403 consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ
1839404 you believe that there is one god you do well the demons also believe and tremble
1839405 but he who received the seed on stony places this is he who hears the word the informed mind and immediately receives it with joy stirred emotions yet he has no root in himself but endures only for a while
1839406 by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name

1839415 i have had the mind bending experience of looking at people i know to have features similar to mine and having racist thoughts about them
1839416 o ur bodies born in one place and raised in another speaking different languages nourished from different tables are manifestations of the uneasy and often violent clash of race and nationality
1839417 i was probably one of the only asians they had ever encountered in the flesh
1839418 we had identical accents and each was as typically aussie as the next yet somehow i became different
1839419 a doptees need not give in to notions that cultural attributes are inherent or that one is better than the other but where does such powerful knowledge leave these outsiders within
1839420 n o doubt we talked about race when mike was first adopted children speak their curiosity but i dont remember conversations on racism
1839421 mom and i collect rocks dad and i skip stones across the water my heart breaks as i smile because this is the only way we can be together me as a baby girl child and them loving the child they remember
1839422 s ome striking similarities come to mind when we compare the atlantic slave trade and international adoption
1839423 both practices are driven by insatiable consumer demand private market interests and cynical profit making
1839424 the public would not tolerate white children being placed in foster care at the rates experienced by black children
1839425 one can only imagine the reactions if korean middle class couples whether in korea or living overseas suddenly started to adopt white children
1839426 i often meet younger adoptive parents beaming over cute little kids tucked into state of the art strollers i smile back knowingly but dont dare say what im thinking dont be surprised if your daughter shoplifts or slips into a deep depression or flies into a rage and threatens you with a knife before falling into a sobbing heap on the floor
1839427 i wanted to be the loving nurturing mom they ran to with their sorrows including the loss of their birth parents and their encounters with racism but i wasnt ready for anger
1839428 some kads have come to see our kad culture and identity as stronger than our ties to either the birth or adoptive culture
1839429 we parents ought to be talking among ourselves about how we will endure over the long haul as our children grow up and away and venture into worlds unfamiliar to us
1839430 if the mother is angry then it is my fault i am a bad person

1839476 i dont think i know any lesbians in this city
1839477 i am proud to join with our lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered brothers and sisters in celebrating the accomplishments the lives and the families of all lgbt people during this pride season too often the issue of lgbt rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us but at its core this issue is about who we are as americans
1839478 its time to live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect lets enact federal civil rights legislation to outlaw hate crimes and protect workers against discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity or expression lets repeal dont ask dont tell and demonstrate that the most effective and professional military in the world is open to all americans who are ready and willing to serve our country lets treat the relationships and the families of lgbt americans with full equality under the law
1839479 we are ready to accomplish these goals because of the courage and persistence of lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered people who have are working every day to achieve equal rights the gay couple who demand equal treatment in our family laws as they raise their children the lesbian soldier who wants nothing more than to serve her country openly and honestly the transgendered workers who asks for the simple dignity of being judged by the quality of their work generations of lgbt americans at once ordinary and extraordinary have made possible this moment in our history with leadership and hard work we can fulfill the promise of equality for all

1839499 the powerful lobbying group whose hawkish right wing leadership has often defied both the views of the broader u s jewish community and the policies of israeli governments
1839500 my emphasis added indeed they should but there is a much bigger and related imperative as i never tire of writing and saying commentators should
1839501 zionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force there is no other ethic it is important to speak hebrew but unfortunately it is even more important to be able to shoot or else i am through with playing at colonization to the hackneyed reproach that this point of view is unethical i answer absolutely untrue as long as there is the faintest spark of hope for the arabs to impede us they will not sell these hopes not for any tasty morsel because this is not a rabble but a people a living people and no people makes such enormous concessions on such fateful questions except when there is no hope left until we have removed every opening visible in the iron wall
1839502 jews can never again trust gentiles if the gentile world cannot understand why the zionist state of israel must do what its doing to hold and keep what it has most if not all of it the gentile world can go to hell

1839546 lindagine mostra chiaramente che gli israeliani non credono che la politica di pressione a cui sottopongono gli abitanti di gaza sia efficace
1839547 c un impressionante accordo tra le linee politiche e ideologiche che porta a considerare che sia molto probabile che il blocco di gaza porti la popolazione verso posizioni estremistiche e c un forte consenso rispetto al fatto che il blocco danneggi prevalentemente i civili e sia totalmente inutile rispetto allobiettivo di portarli a cambiare il regime di hamas
1839548 emerge chiaramente che lopinione pubblica israeliana pi realistica dei politici che agiscono nel suo nome che cercano di giustificare una volgare violazione dei diritti dei palestinesi servendosi di una giustificazione basata su ragioni di sicurezza che la maggior parte degli israeliani considera totalmente infondata
1839549 i politici e la classe dirigente israeliani dovrebbero ascoltare bene le persone che li stanno mettendo in guardia rispetto al fatto che la politica israeliana a gaza sta principalmente danneggiando i civili palestinesi a discapito degli interessi della stessa israele
1839550 lindagine prova che la leadership israeliana tormentata dal populismo nonostante il fatto che gli israeliani siano perfettamente consapevoli che mettere sotto pressione la popolazione civile e creare danni a persone innocenti non pu portare alcun beneficio alla sicurezza di israele sembra proprio che gli israeliani siano pi umani di coloro che li governano che continuano a sostenere la violazione dei diritti umani palestinesi anche impedendo di fornire adeguate cure mediche a pazienti che stanno lottando per la sopravvivenza
1839551 in case you hadnt noticed this is the summertime lull in the presidential race
1839552 its also the time when candidates road test messages strategies speeches and ads for the general election and the time when the candidates pick their running mates
1839553 so far this summer has been full of charges and counter charges but nothing has moved the dial much
1839554 first came the charge hotly disputed that obama decided to go to the gym rather than meet with the troops
1839555 the mccain campaign had more success breaking through with the britney paris ad which made for good television but left lots of independent voters and rank and file republicans scratching their heads
1839556 then came the grenade mccain campaign manager rick davis charged that obama had played the race card in a speech obama denied it but it made news
1839557 mccain camp tactics have worked at least to some extent taking obama off message over the last week last weeks message was supposed to be about the economy and obama found himself defending his remarks on race this week its energy well see if obama has better luck breaking through on that front
1839558 well see if obama has better luck breaking through on that front

1839575 but i have to disappoint you she simply doesnt exist the story was inspired from a real life meeting with another female friend yes but the kiss and stuff was pure hyperbole i thought that was quite obvious
1839576 and yeah felt really sorry for you about the break up
1839577 and whats the funda with your unshaven face and stuff still brooding over the love failure eh
1839578 ew sorry i forgot my limits momentarily people say i butt in others issues quite a lot maybe i should learn to control
1839579 oh please dont feel so thats a different matter altogether maybe ill tell you the story someday ah the food has come why dont we dig our teeth in
1839580 hey arent you that guy who blogged about getting ragged and stuff eh
1839581 good evening r we didnt expect you to turn up so fast when you called up half an hour ago
1839582 ah i intended to start from home sometime back but my daughter insisted on dropping her to tuition which actually made me late
1839583 oh i see which subject your daughters trade is electronics amp communication if im not wrong
1839584 exactly its this paper called solid state devices she finds it pretty tough
1839585 so hows the champ doing badly fractured eh how much did you score for your exams
1839586 em uncle i dont know my scores for they wont publish your scores if you fail for your exams i have three back papers
1839587 omigod thats pathetic obnoxious three back papers and that too for the first year this is totally unacceptable evidently youve been wasting your time all through if youd focussed your energies on your studies youd surely have done well
1839588 youre right mr r my son wouldnt study a word neither at college or at home you should see his attitude hed do anything but study and hes madly addicted to the computer television and novels
1839589 hmm he could very well learn from my daughter you see she had the seventh rank in the higher secondary examinations and scored a neat 1500 rank for the entrance and she did this all through sheer hard work shes really intelligent too not many of her classmates at sct college of engineering have marks close to her whopping 84
1839590 did you say eighty four thats a very good percentage wow
1839591 hmm you know what your problem is son you simply were whiling your time away see your college is a government college and you simply had all opportunities to go wayward and i guess you were utilizing it to the fullest extent just check out his sessionals ramesh my dad also go meet his teachers too i seriously doubt hes into bad company who knows this accident could be result of a drunken brawl or something you cant trust kids why dont you confiscate his bike or rather why did you buy him a bike first of all
1839592 i too have my doubts r but the accident wasnt a result of a brawl or something for sure
1839593 the bikes my wifes brothers he took it to college that day citing some lab exam or something i still dont take that alibi and my illustrious son still sticks to it god alone knows why the accident happened in front of my office and the eye witnesses version matches his so i dont think its a lie still its goanna burn a lot of dough im sure
1839594 good anyway you should see boys these days theyre so indolent my daughter speaks of all the strikes even conducted by first years in the college when i was a first year at cet i was totally immersed into studies we wouldnt even walk about the corridors for fear of getting ragged but i guess your son hasnt suffered much ragging perhaps thats a reason why he flunked so miserably my daughter used to study for hours everyday at home and today shes reaping the benefits of her effort
1839595 youre right i hear people say that my son has a blog or something i dont know what it really is but thats some kind of website where people write stuff they say he writes well and all i think hes wasting his time over there im going to cut his internet connection as soon as we get back home

1839779 the secret authorization of brutal interrogations is an outrageous betrayal of our core values and a grave danger to our security we must do whatever it takes to track down and capture or kill terrorists but torture is not a part of the answer it is a fundamental part of the problem with this administrations approach torture is how you create enemies not how you defeat them torture is how you get bad information not good intelligence torture is how you set back americas standing in the world not how you strengthen it its time to tell the world that america rejects torture without exception or equivocation its time to stop telling the american people one thing in public while doing something else in the shadows no more secret authorization of methods like simulated drowning when i am president america will once again be the country that stands up to these deplorable tactics when i am president we wont work in secret to avoid honoring our laws and constitution we will be straight with the american people and true to our values

1839783 while we are grieving this process there is a hope
1839784 as it the e mail opened it was this picture of me kissing maria goodbye in that parking lot in china about two weeks earlier
1839785 and it was instant i knew that that was a picture of a daddy kissing his little girl it wasnt just a guy with a little child that needed a home it was a daddy and a little girl it was just so clear when i saw it
1839786 we knew from the get go that she was a firecracker
1839787 the girls had been playing on the playground and complete accident she was actually excited that he was coming home and he is so great with the girls they just love him and she was running to see him and you know ran you know into the path of the car
1839788 i just really had a deep concern in my heart that i wouldnt lose two children as a result of this because i knew what will was struggling with
1839789 we have talked a lot and you will hear all of us talk about the process of grieving with hope thats what has kept us breathing kept us alive is that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
1839790 ive said you know somewhat coldly i dont care whose lives are touched by this story and whose lives are changed or what good comes of it as the heart of a mom i want maria back
1839791 and thats you know thats what i want people to know is i want maria back but because i know that she is completely whole because of my faith i know that shes completely whole and completely ok and im going to see her again as a mom i have to shift that grief to go
1839792 i have emily whos getting married and her fianc tanner and caleb and his girlfriend julia and will franklin you know hes my baby boy and then shaoey and stevey and my grief gets shifted to making sure there as whole and as healthy as they can be
1839793 but its the heart of a mom id like to have maria back
1839794 obviously its been really hard you know just the past couple months
1839795 i started running after the accident you know and started just running away from the house and i remember caleb was the first one to run and kind of just jump on me and hold me and then shaoey was right there by him
1839796 to me you know that meant a ton i didnt really want to be at the house i just wanted to be away and i was just freaking out
1839797 ive gotten str a stronger faith through all this you know and more faith through all this but then theres those days you know that just hit you and youre just like oh man this is just awful but you just gotta continue to choose to live and thats the faith that that continues to keep me going you know
1839798 when you see someone hurting and you see someone burdened you want to take that burden from em and because you i youd rather endure that pain than see your brother in this case my for real brother endure that pain
1839799 and sometimes you turn the corner and youve got a straightaway and its beautiful and then you can turn a corner at the end of that straightaway and its thunderstorms and mountains and it can be hard even within the same day
1839800 my son said the other day that you know yeah we are family but were a family with a lot of questions
1839801 but thats what faith is its living with the questions that doesnt mean you have the answers thats exactly what faith is

1839837 masters can guide us through the turmoil as a beacon from the lighthouse guides the mariner
1839838 our teachers have given us faith but now you come to cast doubt on that faith therefore we want to know whether masters exist or not please strengthen us in our belief that they exist tell us whether or not you yourself were guided by them
1839839 if i come in contact with the masters i can find out their plan for humanity
1839840 we seek a plan for the physical welfare of man
1839841 what is beneficial and useful for me is dangerous for you

1839849 if we dont have a spiritual life if you look around us you will see many famous people or powerful people who have become victims of their own power and suffer deeply
1839850 we carry that suffering to others whether we are leaders in a government or a business or fathers or mothers in families
1839851 with the practice of mindful walking and breathing they can transform their government the parliament into a kind of family where people can listen to each and learn from each other and work with harmony and compassion
1839852 a good leader should be free from anger they should be always knowledgeable ready to love and forgive others

1839860 the media are only as liberal as the conservative businesses that own them
1839861 there is no such thing as bad weather only different kinds of good weather
1839862 to hear many religious people talk one would think god created the torso head legs and arms but the devil slapped on the genitals
1839863 the media are only as liberal as the conservative businesses that own them
1839864 most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name
1839865 we will release rafinha to play at the olympic games if the brazilian football association quickly create the conditions for his involvement
1839866 this decision is in line with fifas appeal to allow the player to take part in the olympics
1839867 we now expect the world governing body to support us in our talks with the cbf particularly as what we are demanding is precisely what fifa wishes to set down in its regulations in this matter
1839868 not only do we have to come through the opening fixtures in the bundesliga we also have an extremely tough draw in the champions league qualifying round in the shape of atletico madrid
1839869 we could have done with our strongest squad for these matches we firmly believe however that unfortunately there is absolutely no point in bringing rafinha back one day before our opening game
1839870 all the frustration and the huge disappointment he would feel coupled with the exertions of travelling would not in our opinion have put him in a position to play to the best of his ability
1839871 our decision would have been different if the legal position had been clarified earlier
1839872 in that case we wouldnt have let rafinha go under any circumstances
1839873 fifa and the cbf were aware of the situation months ago i believe the matter was deliberately delayed until just before the olympics to put the clubs in an awkward position
1839874 were taking the situation calmly because lionel at the moment is with us
1839875 lionel is going to stay playing with us both tomorrow and for the rest of the tournament
