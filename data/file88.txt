880000 we learned from the pentagon wednesday night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event and decided instead not to go
880001 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity
880002 restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics
880003 the senators staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senators visit to landstuhl and quite frankly i expected them to have the visit
880004 the senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
880005 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
880006 iraq and our strategic position in the middle east in ruins risking a wider war in the near future
880007 amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
880008 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
880009 a pretty good timetable as we should have horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
880010 the american people are looking for a serious debate about the way forward in iraq and afghanistan and angry false accusations will do nothing to accomplish that goal
880011 was engaging in fraud or potentially illegal acts or other inappropriate transactions
880012 when we learned of the jury verdict earlier this month the campaign donated mr berkmans contribution to the american red cross for midwest flood relief and recovery
880013 he used political donations and the doors those opened to build a web like a spider
880014 someone should ask john mccain with all these folks in your campaign you couldnt put his name into
880015 i believe that the best way to support iraqi sovereignty and to encourage the iraqis to stand up is through the responsible redeployment of our combat brigades
880016 its unrealistic to expect that a u s president alone can suddenly snap his fingers about bringing about peace in this region
880017 the notion is is that either i do exactly what my military commanders tell me to do or im ignoring their advice
880018 no im factoring in their advice but placing it in this broader strategic framework thats required
880019 i will leave it to the voters to make that decision
880020 by continuing his opposition to the surge strategy long after it has proven successful and by admitting that his plan for withdrawal places him at odds with general david petraeus barack obama has made clear that his goal remains unconditional withdrawal rather than securing the victory our troops have earned and the surge has made possible
880021 an extra day spent in ohio is not really a problem
880022 thats not something thats going to happen every day im not going to worry about it
880023 i may not make the first one but ill make one eventually
880024 i know this isnt the first time weve asked you for money and it wont be the last
880025 we have developed a strategy a very aggressive strategy that will only work if our millions of supporters continue to contribute their time and their money
880026 raising money online draws on the capacity of the internet to convert peoples momentary enthusiasm or sense of whimsy or outrage into money
880027 i dont know how you come in and build a budget around that
880028 if we wait until the next administration it could be a year before we get those additional troops on the ground here in afghanistan and i think that would be a mistake
880029 i think the situation is getting urgent enough that weve got to start doing something now
880030 our message to the afghan government is this we want a strong partnership based on more for more more resources from the united states and nato and more action from the afghan government to improve the lives of the afghan people
880031 the discussions focused on the significant progress that weve made but also on the unmet challenges we still have ahead of us
880032 the discussions also focused on the difficulties were facing the difficult challenges of the fight against corruption counternarcotics and also the continuing threat of terrorism and fundamentalism not just threatening the way of life in afghanistan but also in the region
880033 losing is not an option when it comes to al qaeda and it never has been
880034 and thats why the fact that we engaged in a war of choice when we were not yet finished with that task was such a mistake
880035 if we wait until the next administration it could be a year before we get those additional troops on the ground here in afghanistan and i think that would be a mistake
880036 i think the situation is getting urgent enough that weve got to start doing something now
880037 our message to the afghan government is this we want a strong partnership based on more for more more resources from the united states and nato and more action from the afghan government to improve the lives of the afghan people
880038 the discussions focused on the significant progress that weve made but also on the unmet challenges we still have ahead of us
880039 the discussions also focused on the difficulties were facing the difficult challenges of the fight against corruption counter narcotics and also the continuing threat of terrorism and fundamentalism not just threatening the way of life in afghanistan but also in the region
880040 losing is not an option when it comes to al qaeda and it never has been
880041 and thats why the fact that we engaged in a war of choice when we were not yet finished with that task was such a mistake
880042 you see a consensus developing that the current system is unsustainable
880043 but actually saying what has to happen next is a little bit scary if youre in a campaign especially if some of your most prominent supporters have such deep ties to these entities
880044 i am hopeful that the extent of carnage will shake up the status quo
880045 and if the taxpayers end up putting in a significant amount of money which i think they will members of congress will realize whatever their past views were the future cannot be a replay of the past
880046 we did well in the primary election in virginia and we want to do well in the general election
880047 if we do our job here in fairfax county were going to make sure that virginia is carried by barack obama
880048 we do have this visitor to virginia today the other candidate
880049 but john mccain is no stranger to virginia he knows our hearts he knows virginia values
880050 the preeminent resource for alumni education professionals to exchange information and discover new ideas
880051 people who try never suceed so stop trying and just do it
880052 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
880053 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
880054 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
880055 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
880056 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
880057 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
880058 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
880059 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
880060 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
880061 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
880062 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
880063 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
880064 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
880065 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
880066 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
880067 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
880068 i was contacted some time ago by a previous cardinal but i dont want to talk any more about it
880069 the professor may not want to give anything away but there is an important clue in his reply
880070 ratzinger is on record suggesting that freemasonry was set up to persecute christianity perhaps it is the revenge of the templars that the church fears since the origin of freemasonry is rooted in the persecution of the templars by the church
880071 because i know it is christs will that we be one and however long it takes that has to be our goal pope benedict again and again comes back to this as at the heart of what he is working for
880072 and perhaps overlooked that cardinal kasper also stated in his address that arcic
880073 i appreciated damian thompsons work in comparing and contrasting all three cardinals addresses but i did not find them to be quite so far apart from each other as thompsons commentary seemed to me to suggest
880074 well be interviewing the mother and other people associated with this inquiry in the near future
880075 war memorials have always held a special place in our society so deliberately damaging the ashfield war memorial costs the community to clean up as well as being distressing and disrespectful to veterans
880076 but certainly any type of graffiti or vandalism is of major concern to police and thats why we have a special task force to investigate and take action against those people responsible for this type of crime

880081 ensuring drivers who cause death on our roads through bad driving are suitably punished is essential if justice is to be done and people maintain their support for the criminal justice system
880082 thats why the government welcomes the firm guidelines published by the independent sentencing guidelines council
880083 justice ministers want to see two new offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death by driving while unlicensed disqualified or uninsured introduced at the earliest opportunity and will make an announcement later

880117 zawahri has been killed by them several times but once again this claim is wrong this is baseless
880118 theres a huge amount of money we need to raise and we have to be aware of that
880119 its one of the reasons why the clinton people are so important
880120 im trying to exercise a little bit which im told does wonders for a person
880121 progressives are going to have to organize for progressive values
880122 the democratic party today is quite liberal and obama if anything will deepen the roots of its liberalism
880123 my 16 month timeline if you examine everything ive said was always premised on making sure our troops were safe
880124 and my guiding approach continues to be that weve got to make sure that our troops are safe and that iraq is stable and im going to continue to gather information to find out whether those conditions still hold
880125 let me be as clear as i can be i intend to end this war
880126 my first day in office i will bring the joint chiefs of staff in and i will give them a new mission that is to end this war responsibly deliberately but decisively
880127 must be as careful getting out of iraq as it was reckless going in
880128 a strategic error for us to maintain a long term occupation in iraq
880129 i have always said i would listen to the commanders on the ground i have always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed when i go to iraq and have time to talk to the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
880130 its easy with mccain hes clearly going to pursue without exceptions the bush administration line including the policy toward cuba
880131 the democrats are kind of a mystery theyll want to loosen things and they wont want to fight with everybody like bush did
880132 i am encouraged by our better relations and i will do everything i can to continue our path of cooperation and better relations with all nations in our hemisphere
880133 hes been to the amazon rain forest hes been to the galapagos islands so for him the relationship with our southern neighbors is not just a series of briefings by an outside policy adviser because he needed to have a policy position on latin america
880134 its very hard to argue youre going to pay more attention to a region youve never bothered to visit
880135 at its core the economy isnt the sum of an array of bewildering statistics
880136 its about where americans work how they live how they pay their bills today and save for tomorrow its about small businesses opening their doors hiring employees and growing
880137 the near term path to balance is built on three principles reasonable economic growth comprehensive spending controls and bipartisanship in budget efforts
880138 the only way to keep the budget balanced is successful reform of the large spending pressures in social security medicaid
880139 there is just no way that you can avoid anticipating what is going to come everyone is aware that mccain is different on these issues
880140 were all kind of waiting with anticipation because we just dont know how hes going to thread this needle
880141 really out of step with the strong majority of his party
880142 he might get what he wants and he might get a change but i dont think its going to sit well with a lot of republicans
880143 we are confident that this process will produce a platform that all republicans will enthusiastically support
880144 our party is united and will continue to work together to elect john mccain in november
880145 i dont think you are going to see any radical departures or inflammatory demands for change in one direction or another

880150 ze hebben niet hun hele loopbaan aan vlans virtuele lans en bgp routing border gateway protocol besteed
880151 klanten zeiden dat het een stuk gemakkelijker zou zijn als wij hen konden vertellen hoe ze deze oplossingen kunnen samenbrengen
880152 onze managers zijn bij elkaar geweest om punten van technologische integratie te identificeren waarop we gaan samenwerken
880153 de relatie tussen citrix en akamai betreft gezamenlijke marketing en dat is het wel zon beetje
880154 ze waren het eerst op de markt met de meest geavanceerde functies en hun app delivery controllers hebben de meeste functionaliteit
880155 er zijn veel client server applicaties windows applicaties die je beter kunt virtualiseren of streamen

880159 what is then the principal intent of chicano literature to exchange one stereotype for another to destroy stereotypes to verify that which is chicano and to conserve it to commit the chicano to social change to provide a vehicle for self reflection a proper mirror a proper labyrinth
880160 why not all of this all of this has value all of these encompass the totality of the chicano being

880165 the game returned several days later as wordscraper a redesigned and renamed game thats probably just different enough to keep hasbros lawyers away and all the while facebook says that its only action was to forward hasbros complaint to the creators of scrabulous
880166 seems to me that this shows at least an attempt not to infuriate the fanbase by taking away the fun altogether but it seems to have backfired among some fans who feel manipulated
880167 being in this area has made me a lot more politically in tune with whats going on
880168 bush was a good man and had good morals i felt he was the better man
880169 this trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to american national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face
880170 we have to bring the war in iraq to a respectable responsible and honorable end
880171 thats the bet our founding fathers were making all of those years that our individual destinies could be tied together in the common destiny of democracy that government depends not just on the consent of the governed but on the service of citizens
880172 thats what history calls us to do because loving your country shouldnt just mean watching fireworks on the fourth of july loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it
880173 the ideal is to win however having been a veteran of three statewide races in six years i know the reality of places like el paso county

880177 there are 125 days left until the american people will decide the next president
880178 senator mccain is the underdog in the race we suspect he is behind nationally five to eight points but well within striking distance i will help run an organization that exists for the purpose of delivering john mccains message to the american people
880179 theyve been attacking obama every day but it doesnt tie back to an overarching theme that mccain believes in
880180 theyve been playing this ripped from the headlines game whatever is hot or interesting for the day is what theyve been talking about
880181 it addresses the need to put a professional in charge of message
880182 we just saw it as an excellent way to highlight senator smiths ability to work across the aisle even with the democratic nominee for the white house
880183 except in rare instances and im not sure it was a good idea in the first place
880184 who says gordon smith helped lead the fight for better gas mileage and a cleaner environment
880185 its hard to ignore what you hear when everybody you know is saying it
880186 its like youre hearing about two different men with nothing in common
880187 it makes it impossible to figure out whats true or what you can believe
880188 ill admit that i probably dont follow all of the election news like maybe i should
880189 i havent read his books or studied up more than a little bit but its hard to ignore what you hear when everybody you know is saying it these are good people smart people so can they really all be wrong
880190 during this campaign mr davis has not received a single penny from any company doing business with the mccain campaign
880191 why would a candidate for president hire a lobbyist whose firm worked against our national interests
880192 being the manager of the most amazing political comeback in modern political history
880193 it does seem to reflect a willingness to change on positions to be more liberal in the primary to moving more conservative in the general election
880194 i guess i should welcome that but it looks like to me either inexperience or incredible flip flopping
880195 those who accomplish the most are those who dont make the perfect the enemy of the good
880196 barack is a pragmatist in that sense he has a larger vision but oftentimes knows that we cant get there with one legislative effort when these occasions arise he is willing to accept progress even marginal gain as a step toward that vision
880197 american voters tend to reward politicians who take clear stands
880198 when obama takes these mushy positions it could speak to a character issue voters that dont pay a lot of attention look at one thing does the guy believe in something they may be saying the guy is afraid of his own shadow
880199 guilt trip on the rest of us because we know hes right
880200 youve had enough evidence that theres no doubt at least as i view the two senators who is the reformer

880224 this is the first instance of a disease modifying alzheimers therapy that has attained its primary pre specified cognitive efficacy target in a clinical trial
880225 this trial therefore provides the first clinical trial evidence that an alzheimers therapy aimed at blocking tau aggregation may be a viable disease modifying treatment we now need to confirm this in a larger phase iii trial
880226 our results appear to meet the draft emea clinical guidelines for disease modifying therapy supported by spect and pet evidence of efficacy in brain regions heavily affected by tau pathology

880429 saya berpakaian seperti ini bukan berarti saya berganti profesi ujarnya sambil tersenyum khas tapi saya hanya mengikuti permintaan dari kontingen saya yakni kontingen diponegoro

880433 ini tidak tepat apalagi menjelang pemilu dan lain lain jangan lakukan tmp
880434 sgt kelly wore a hidden audio recorder and engaged detective batista in conversation in an attempt to get him to make incriminating statements
880435 the implications of having an undercover officer not just inside the detective squad but as batistas commanding officer are enormous
880436 its unprecedented that a commanding officer of a detective squad would engage in this its scary stuff
880437 msgr harris has denied the allegations which concern actions that allegedly occurred 20 years ago
880438 i said why dont we call him and tell him his boat is sinking again

880444 i think weve got a chance to be good for quite a while
880445 we wanted to find a way to strengthen our communities by inspiring individuals to be better drivers
880446 approximately 600 washingtonians die in traffic crashes each year and most are preventable
880447 the only way to help people understand how to be collision free for life is to change the patterns that currently exist on our roadways
880448 the spirit of drive nice day is all about inspiring as many people as possible to focus on making may 22nd a collision free day in washington state
880449 we cant ignore the obvious connections between driving nice and driving safe
880450 motorists who respect other motorists cyclists and pedestrians create an environment that enhances traffic safety and emphasizes taking responsibility for our actions as drivers
880451 each year we make a list of the safest drivers in the united states based on company claim data unfortunately seattle and tacoma vied for positions near the bottom of our list in 2007

880456 do you know why we said lady candidates need not apply
880457 but you must start somewhere otherwise no woman will ever be able to work in your factories
880458 jeh thats what his close associates called him this young woman is an engineer and that too a postgraduate she is the first woman to work on the telco shop floor

880468 the world becomes such a romantic notion when i think about the asteroid headed our way
880469 at the end of the day there may not be the evidence there to mount a homicide inquiry and an attempt to bring anybody to justice for whatever crimes took place there
880470 we were pinning our hopes on the process of carbon dating
880471 the latest information were getting is that for the period were looking at its not going to be possible to give us an exact time of death
880472 the indications are that if the results come back the same way as they have now it is obvious there wont be a homicide inquiry

880509 its the x files film had a bit of a rough time in the states
880510 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
880511 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges
880512 he proceeded to describe to the group a very long and detailed homicidal plan to kill his co workers because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges
880513 justice must be done there and must be seen to be done there fairly and impartially
880514 theyre all senior officers this is a highly educated sophisticated jury very different from what you would find in miami or anywhere else where they go by voter registration
880515 well versed in setting aside raw emotion in determining fact
880516 guilty or convicted or whatever they would be housed in a different facility
880517 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him
880518 balance between security and the right to present a case
880519 this trial has been an embarrassment its embarrassing that the united states would convene the first tribunal since world war ii to prosecute such a lowly and marginal figure and its embarrassing that this system has been devised to allow prosecution of the alleged crimes of the detainees while covering up the crimes committed against them
880520 i put a high ball up and just chased through a swinging arm in the tackle i must have connected with a hard part of williams body and seemed to come out with a broken hand
880521 it happened just before half time as i was running back i had a bit of a feel and it was clicking
880522 the contact was a little painful it settled down but the clicking didnt seem right so i thought there was something wrong i asked the doc martin raftery why it was clicking and he said probably because its broken then the buzzer went and i went off and assessed it
880523 if i go into surgery on monday theres still three weeks until we play our first game the doc seems to think there is scope for that second leg
880524 that would be four weeks and that would be plenty of time im a quick healer i havent been ruled out yet thats given that surgery goes according to plan
880525 its hard to say when ill have the surgery because doc is probably on the phone at the moment trying to book in and get it done
880526 its always very frustrating to one be replaced and two come off injured
880527 the nzru and the hurricanes board have conducted a complete review of our 2008 campaign and as a result of that ive been asked to continue as head coach
880528 im delighted to have this opportunity and help to continue guiding the hurricanes back in 2003 the goal was to build a competitive team and then build depth which we achieved we took another major step forward in 2008 when we selected a squad made up entirely of players from within the region and now i believe the franchise is in a great position to achieve our ultimate goal
880529 when he first came over we were just happy it was a kiwi coming to our shores with a fully paid job
880530 but all of a sudden after five victories on the trot including beating the world champion south africans and the mighty all blacks he was about to become prime minister
880531 if we had won again had we been a republic he would have become president
880532 he will be a bit shell shocked after the loss to come to his home country as the hailed coach who has done so much for our wallabies you know 39 points hell wake up thinking was i dreaming that
880533 all of a sudden he wont be quite the blue eyed boy
880534 there are some really good rugby players in that side some big game players and some experienced players
880535 that is what keeps you wanting to play the game because you want to get out there and play in the number two jersey
880536 obviously this is the role they see me in at the moment i just have to make sure i can do the role well and keep working towards the goal of getting back there and playing there
880537 you have to put the team first and do the job for the team
880538 but you have to be hungry to get out there and start that is what makes rugby players good the hunger to want to be out there
880539 it has been tough coming in late in the game the games have been really unstructured and its been hard to have a real impact in the game
880540 i just have to get used to the role i am in at the moment and try and make an impact
880541 it is tough because the game is unstructured during the minutes we are on the field we just need to make sure that myself and the guys who come on the field apply ourselves well
880542 it is more because of the elvs all the quick taps and stuff both teams are playing a bit more desperately in the last 10 or 15 minutes so we need to make sure that we are prepared for that sort of rugby once we get on
880543 he was only in for a couple of days but he trained really well
880544 siddhivinayak temple has a huge following in mumbai and the temple trust was interested in getting the devotees involved in the film so we approached many of them and everyone readily agreed
880545 we are going to show six or seven miraculous stories authorised by the temple trust in one of them sachin has an important part towards climax of the story
880546 we decided to make this film because several devotees said more people should know about lord ganesh
880547 a scientific manner and it is not a superstitious account
880548 lord ganesh worshipped his parents a lot and devotees should implement that
880549 i really dont care this trip is about how many people i can help and how many lives i can touch
880550 i can tell you about every person i have hugged and who i have met
880551 im a man driven by passion but i am really not doing much
880552 im simply riding a bike going to a couple of places and working for a day
880553 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally
880554 she always said that if i was near galveston i should come by
880555 after meeting me you cant go back and think everybody is a piece of expletive
880556 as a black man i know that black men need to see you dont have to be bad to distinguish yourself
880557 weve made a verbal promise to the senior citizens that they will always have a place to hold their lunches
880558 the strength of a city is measured in its quality of living
880559 we try to get in guest speakers once a month to talk about senior citizen issues
880560 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
880561 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
880562 every big town i know of has a community center
880563 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug
880564 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
880565 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
880566 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
880567 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
880568 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
880569 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
880570 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
880571 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
880572 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
880573 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
880574 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
880575 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
880576 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
880577 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
880578 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
880579 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
880580 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
880581 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
880582 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
880583 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
880584 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
880585 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
880586 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
880587 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
880588 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
880589 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time
880590 bernard henri l vy a rendu hommage ce lundi l crivain russe alexandre soljenitsyne
880591 je suis tr s boulevers par la mort de soljenitsyne sa vie a t bouleversante son oeuvre a t bouleversante et sa mort est videmment bouleversante
880592 il fut autant que les etats unis dam rique tout entier et que le vatican tout entier lun des responsables de la d b cle du communisme si le communisme sest effondr nous le devons aussi pour une large part cet immense crivain qu tait soljenitsyne
880593 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
880594 now the spirit of the lord had departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord tormented him
880595 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
880596 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
880597 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
880598 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
880599 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
880600 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
880601 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
880602 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
880603 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
880604 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
880605 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
880606 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
880607 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
880608 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
880609 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
880610 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
880611 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
880612 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
880613 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
880614 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
880615 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
880616 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
880617 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
880618 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
880619 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
880620 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
880621 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
880622 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
880623 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
880624 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
880625 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
880626 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
880627 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
880628 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
880629 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
880630 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
880631 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
880632 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
880633 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
880634 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
880635 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
880636 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
880637 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
880638 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
880639 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
880640 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
880641 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
880642 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
880643 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
880644 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
880645 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
880646 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
880647 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
880648 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
880649 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
880650 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
880651 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
880652 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
880653 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
880654 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
880655 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
880656 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
880657 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
880658 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
880659 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
880660 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
880661 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
880662 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
880663 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
880664 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
880665 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
880666 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
880667 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
880668 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible

880680 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
880681 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

880694 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
880695 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
880696 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
880697 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
880698 whether you think you can or whether you think you cant youre right
880699 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
880700 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth

880702 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
880703 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
880704 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

880706 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
880707 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
880708 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
880709 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
880710 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
880711 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
880712 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
880713 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
880714 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
880715 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
880716 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
880717 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
880718 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
880719 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
880720 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
880721 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
880722 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
880723 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
880724 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
880725 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
880726 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
880727 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
880728 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
880729 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
880730 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
880731 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
880732 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
880733 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
880734 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does

880738 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
880739 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
880740 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
880741 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
880742 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
880743 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
880744 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
880745 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
880746 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
880747 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
880748 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
880749 if the vice president says its do able i believe
880750 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
880751 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so

880758 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
880759 this is frustrating i dont understand why these people dont have safe drinking water
880760 nobody can do science by a committee you do science by testing
880761 to me it is appalling that an international organization of the stature of the u n would ignore the evidence of past climate changing
880762 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
880763 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
880764 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
880765 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
880766 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
880767 remember the time we had the talk on the bathroom floor of that bar
880768 it was nothing out of the ordinary for a big show
880769 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
880770 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
880771 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
880772 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
880773 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
880774 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
880775 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
880776 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
880777 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
880778 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
880779 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
880780 we dont need to come again next year so we dont need season passes
880781 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
880782 when we get in run and grab the tables to the left
880783 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
880784 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
880785 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
880786 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
880787 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
880788 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
880789 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
880790 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
880791 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
880792 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
880793 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
880794 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
880795 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
880796 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
880797 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
880798 hey man i think youre cool you are a great fuck and i believe you would make sure i enjoy having anal sex with you i hope your dick and my ass have a lovely time together
880799 yeah we tried but i didnt know what i was doing then she said no more and i was like but i figured out what i was doing wrong noooooo
880800 i tried several times with my ex but he just didnt have the finesse i told him what to do and he just didnt get it so i stopped asking that was a couple years ago
880801 hey want to have anal sex when we go to mexico in a couple weeks
880802 i want to do something special when were in mexico its just a once in a while thing and were going on vacation
880803 your pussy is tight but you can always take me the ass is the same way
880804 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
880805 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
880806 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
880807 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
880808 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
880809 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
880810 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
880811 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
880812 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
880813 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
880814 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
880815 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
880816 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
880817 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
880818 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
880819 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
880820 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
880821 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
880822 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
880823 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
880824 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
880825 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
880826 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
880827 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
880828 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
880829 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
880830 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
880831 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
880832 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
880833 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
880834 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
880835 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
880836 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
880837 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
880838 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
880839 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
880840 we are so going to get it on tonight once h es done throwing up
880841 it always starts with one finger but he always begs me for more
880842 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
880843 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
880844 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
880845 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
880846 see im not the only artist with a messy studio
880847 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking start ups to grow their customer base and reach profitability recent evidence the agreements between gypsii and bothgarmin and samsung similarly loopt has established partnerships with all major us cellular carriers

880853 it is with immense pride and a great sense of achievement that i look back and contemplate the success of the srs not to mention the teamwork and expertise at daresbury that went into building maintaining and operating this great british scientific facility of course this is a sad occasion for me but since the day the srs was first switched on it has always been subject to a fixed life span and this day was always going to come the srs has kept the uk at the forefront of scientific research and now passes its baton onto the new diamond light source in oxfordshire the uks direct successor to the srs diamond will continue to build on the positive legacy of synchrotron light research in this country
880854 the srs was one of the worlds most pioneering scientific inventions and daresbury can be very proud of its outstanding achievements
880855 though the srs has gone daresbury laboratory is growing it is part of a burgeoning national science and innovation campus and the home of the cockcroft institute a national centre for accelerator science and technology amongst other world class research facilities the governments recent announcement of 65m earmarked for daresbury will provide two new additional science and technology gateway centres for computational science and engineering and detector systems daresbury will also continue its state of the art accelerator science and technology research programmes based on the continuing operation of the energy recovery linac prototype known as alice a technology which already offers important prospects for new cancer treatments

880878 dear friends in christ i think you would agree that the ecumenical movement has reached a critical juncture to move forward we must continually ask god to renew our minds with the holy spirit cf rom 12 2 who speaks to us through the scriptures and guides us into all truth cf 2 pet 1 20 21 jn 16 13 we must guard against any temptation to view doctrine as divisive and hence an impediment to the seemingly more pressing and immediate task of improving the world in which we live in fact the history of the church demonstrates that praxis is not only inseparable from but actually flows out of didache or teaching the more closely we strive for a deeper understanding of the divine mysteries the more eloquently our works of charity will speak of gods bountiful goodness and love towards all saint augustine expressed the nexus between the gift of understanding and the virtue of charity when he wrote that the mind returns to god by love cf de moribus ecclesiae catholicae xii 21 and that wherever one sees charity one sees the trinity de trinitate 8 8 12
880879 a harmonious relationship between religion and public life is all the more important at a time when some people have come to consider religion as a cause of division rather than a force for unity in a world threatened by sinister and indiscriminate forms of violence the unified voice of religious people urges nations and communities to resolve conflicts through peaceful means and with full regard for human dignity one of the many ways religion stands at the service of mankind is by offering a vision of the human person that highlights our innate aspiration to live generously forging bonds of friendship with our neighbours
880880 material possessions in themselves are good we would not survive for long without money clothing and shelter we must eat in order to stay alive yet if we are greedy if we refuse to share what we have with the hungry and the poor then we make our possessions into a false god
880881 worship of the one true god means recognizing in him the source of all goodness entrusting ourselves to him opening ourselves to the healing power of his grace and obeying his commandments that is the way to choose life
880882 here i would like to pause to acknowledge the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country indeed i am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured and i assure them that as their pastor i too share in their suffering these misdeeds which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust deserve unequivocal condemnation they have caused great pain and have damaged the churchs witness i ask all of you to support and assist your bishops and to work together with them in combating this evil victims should receive compassion and care and those responsible for these evils must be brought to justice it is an urgent priority to promote a safer and more wholesome environment especially for young people

881003 iraq will not be represented at the 2008 beijing olympic games and iraqi athletes will not be able to compete at these games
881004 we deeply regret this outcome which severely harms the iraqi olympic and sports movement and the iraqi athletes
881005 we feel like this is an unjust attack on iraq at a time when we need the worlds support
881006 sports is the only thing that brings unity to the iraqis and brings us happiness and now it has been taken away

881014 senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
881015 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
881016 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me
881017 hagel said on john mccain very much johns better than that
881018 john mccain is an honorable man running an increasingly dishonorable campaign
881019 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
881020 i say that it was very clear that a decision had to be made and i made it when it wasnt popular he made a decision which was popular with his base and that is a fundamental difference
881021 im not prepared to see the sacrifice of so many brave young americans lost because senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
881022 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
881023 seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mccain country first
881024 triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
881025 it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props
881026 i think people make a judgment by what we do and what we dont do he certainly found time to do other things if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
881027 churlish and unlike mccain and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election
881028 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
881029 we look forward to seeing the iraqi flag in beijing
881030 if we had scripted this entire event we could not have done a better job than these folks did spontaneously

881034 we are regaining control of the virginia tech reputation and legacy and believe these messages are crucial to accomplishing that goal
881035 we likely will live with the label virginia tech massacre or virginia tech tragedy for years to come in the media however we can use our own language in our own media to help prevent the event from defining us and may gain success in influencing history
881036 confines the incident to specific locations within the university and doesnt allow it to completely define the university
881037 this focuses attention on the victims and what the world has come to know about them as individuals and as a group both students and professors for their outstanding quality and contribution to the university community and society
881038 i told my kids im going to iraq to play army

881041 theft is always a consideration when you are working with adolescents cash high value food and some employees earning near the minimum wage
881042 i think there are an awful lot of mistakes that are made
881043 call it what you want lifting ripping off its stealing and it hurts everyone
881044 its okay for the government to watch them at all times
881045 i dont want a situation where one of our kids makes a mistake and then they are 25 years old applying for a job and somehow that image ends up on youtube
881046 youve got a situation where senator obama has been incessantly criticizing the iraqi government for 18 months
881047 now heres something he thinks can work to his political advantage and so hes embracing it while at the same time rejecting the considered military judgment of those who made the successes of the surge possible like gen david h petraeus and gen raymond t odierno
881048 literally you could have someone using a diploma in an extremely harmful way if they are not properly trained
881049 i think this is a real wake up call to people who think diploma mills are a small problem

881074 although some religious thinkers envision active continuing intervention in nature intelligent design is quite compatible with the view that the universe operates by unbroken natural laws with the design of life perhaps packed into its initial set up
881075 the purposeful design of life to any degree is easily compatible with the idea that after its initiation the universe unfolded exclusively by the intended playing out of natural laws it is also fully compatible with the idea of universal common descent
881076 tipifica un soberano exabrupto y abuso que inclusive rompe con la constituci n nacional
881077 porque sencillamente no estamos en emergencia y menos en un estado excepci n
881078 la sociedad venezolana tendr que aplicar los correctivos que la misma constituci n nacional establece para hacerle ver que est equivocado y que por tanto debe cambiar
881079 los ciudadanos debemos valernos de la carta magna para poder hacer respetar nuestros derechos porque en una democracia lo m s importante es que las decisiones pol ticas tienen que ser aceptadas por el pueblo que a fin de cuentas es a quien representa el poder constituido
881080 porque por puro capricho de ch vez transformaba a la fan de instituci n armada defensiva en ofensiva y adem s permit a la participaci n de tropas venezolanas en el extranjero y que tropas extranjeras operaran en territorio nacional a pedido y decisi n de l exclusivamente
881081 y lo ha focalizado solamente como una problem tica de los militares activos y de algunos militares retirados que opinan a nivel nacional
881082 aqu lo se est conformando es la reedici n del nacional socialismo que en el pasado gener tantos problemas en europa
881083 lo que es necesario entender es que en venezuela se est construyendo un sistema de gobierno muy parecido al de adolfo hitler en la alemania nazi y al fascista de benito mussolini en italia antes de la segunda guerra mundial
881084 quiz s por desconocimiento le dieron vida y propiciaron la beligerancia con esos gobiernos que luego resultaron infames para la sociedad
881085 lo que por v a electoral fue rechazado mayoritariamente por el pueblo ahora se pretende hacer con las leyes de la habilitante
881086 y cuando tengamos tropas venezolanas combatiendo en otros pa ses o militares extranjeros actuando en nuestro pa s ser muy tarde para reaccionar
881087 este es el momento de darle un parao al jefe de estado y al gobierno porque no se puede aceptar y esto lo digo enf ticamente que se cambie la estructura militar venezolana a espaldas del pueblo eso debe producir una reacci n contundente de los venezolanos

881107 i had so many people who came to me when i was in school and got me to where im at now so its been a circular journey for me
881108 i would characterize his involvement as someone who is interested in seeing these two schools happen and he is lending his knowledge skills and access
881109 as we have discussed on many occasions i am going to put applications into the charter school board for two charter schools during the next cycle
881110 i would like to permanently locate the leadership development and entrepreneurship at wilkerson elementary
881111 in recognition of the challenges associated with serving during this period of transition
881112 im unclear as to why the union president is coming to the union in the middle of negotiations and why the president of the union is negotiating away seniority and tenure
881113 theres been so much information put out by people who dont want any change
881114 we are working feverishly right now to resolve the issue
881115 some of it i was going to spend on shopping the rest i was going to save for college
881116 actually i was supposed to go today with my friends to the movies
881117 the benefit isnt as big as it looks when you sit down and eyeball it
881118 the thing we think had the most impact on the rise in scores is the focus on the student
881119 we have spent a lot of time over the past year taking data and honing down to what are the needs of the student and that is what we think is paying off here
881120 for example vocabulary and comprehension our teachers look within these categories and conduct interventions until we feel the student has a handle on that particular skill that has become a strength
881121 what works for one student does not necessarily work for another
881122 i think the more you can understand the culture of a given student the better you can build the relationship with that student and the better you can connect it is a significant tool in the toolbox
881123 i wanted to educate the community and the students about alternative energies and how they are viable
881124 theres a monumental shift going on in this generation of students more and more younger students are fluent in the language of green
881125 its time to move on while i still have time to enjoy myself
881126 im done on oct 30 and on halloween i leave for french polynesia and australia
881127 he has an astute legal mind as well as extensive practical experience and conducts a jury trial in a very fair and orderly manner
881128 he is widely respected in the legal profession and recognized for very scholarly thoughtful opinions but hes also a man of the highest integrity
881129 people dont have to cut off fingers if they are a robber or a mugger
881130 to share detailed information with our members and provide clarity about key issues as they relate to seniority tenure and compensation
881131 will be available for q and a at a designated time during each session
881132 will be out talking about what the benefits of the contract will be
881133 some solace and evidence that we are not going to be making these decisions capriciously or placing them solely in the hands of school principals
881134 we must be able to significantly reward teachers who are successful
881135 and to exit those who even with the right supports are unable to increase their students academic growth
881136 it puzzles me that the issue of rewarding teachers for success rather than seniority is a controversial one
881137 when you watch movies and stuff its like everyone has their own car and everyone can drive and go where they want all the time
881138 you have to scavenge around for money every time you go out
881139 you dont give anyone a ride unless they have 5 for gas
881140 i have a lot of friends in maryland and i didnt go to everyones parties because its half a tank both ways
881141 the model is inspired by the success of home schoolers
881142 the one size fits all model mandated in todays schools is largely counterproductive
881143 these gentlemen see themselves as so far above us that we need some kind of tool to even get their attention
881144 we would regret losing this ability to allow employees of all ranks to interact with the highest levels of county government
881145 i dont think were closed to the idea of talking to our employees
881146 i dont trust any statement they make about wanting to hear our concerns
881147 obviously the jury was persuaded by some of the evidence we disagree
881148 the evidence in this case demonstrated that andre hornsby abused his power for private financial gain tampered with witnesses and obstructed a federal investigation
881149 eager and able to give value and add to the quality of life for others
881150 often when we join these groups its competitive but here when we come together its a reminder of why we got started in the first place to help our communities and for academic excellence
881151 this year was difficult next year is going to be even more so
881152 education is our highest priority but it is 53 percent of the countys budget so we have to look to the schools to find savings and reductions
881153 my daddy thought this would be a good time for me to stay away from the dangerous things around my house
881154 everything is checked against our voter registration system there are lots of indicators for us
881155 the way virginia runs elections is the way thomas jefferson designed them
881156 i am 100 percent confident im here to tell you that we have safeguards built in
881157 this is a very serious and troubling trend that we are seeing in virginia
881158 laws are being broken and virginians have to wonder if there is a deliberate effort underway to corrupt and affect the outcome of novembers elections i urge the governor and attorney general to take immediate action to investigate these matters
881159 vous tes grand seigneur et souverainement digne de louanges grande est votre puissance et votre sagesse sans bornes

881162 actress lindsay lohan has hit out at the los angeles police chief after he said the star had
881163 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

881180 we identified a market need of phlebotomists in the greater metropolitan area
881181 as our population in the country as a whole gets grayer and older theres need for more and more testing as people get ill and need to get diagnosed
881182 were not capable of determining whether textbooks contain language that promotes violence
881183 the content of the books from saudi arabia has been a concern and we have received assurances from the saudi government that they would review and make changes to the textbooks in saudi arabia by the beginning of the 2008 school year
881184 we will wait to see what changes have been made
881185 but somehow i was attracted to aka more than any others
881186 werent vain but there was a certain amount of pride and self worth
881187 you feel it from way down you feel like you just want to hug everyone
881188 these are people you can call and they will pick up
881189 at the airport i ran into someone i hadnt seen in more than a dozen years we just hugged and screamed
881190 its my favorite newspaper i know that sounds crazy but it really is my favorite paper

881193 our kids are getting bumped to another school so that people with two income households can pick where their kids go
881194 its just not fair to the families who stretch their budgets so one parent can stay home
881195 major projects might get started in summer but will continue in the school year
881196 i think youth vote turnout is going to be huge
881197 the question is going to be who is that youth
881198 i worked full time 40 hours a week in bethesda so i understand some of the challenges of trying to pay for your own education
881199 the voices of a generation must join together in a great call for change
881200 i want to commend my partners on the council for their swift sensible action on our gun laws today
881201 none of us wanted this bill to be necessary but i think we have struck the right balance between honoring the supreme courts heller decision and protecting the safety of our residents
881202 we took the opportunity to be serious about our jobs
881203 to receive contracts and expect someone to approve them in a matter of hours or days is totally ludicrous
881204 would like to see ray regarded as the great artist he was and not as somebody who had a terrible life that he wrote about
881205 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
881206 good morning pumpkin did you want me to make you something for breakfast
881207 i dont think there was ever a question of who really belonged there until the numbers shifted
881208 we will review this matter consistent with the importance of academic freedom and the fact that the institute is independently funded and governed
881209 its unclear how much of the gain was from the efforts this year and how much was contributed by the former administration
881210 insufficient evidence to try to sort out which parts of the reforms produced which gains
881211 we made every one of those decisions because we felt that this is what was needed to happen so achievement can be maximized i fully believe we will see the upward trajectory as long as were making the hard decisions
881212 i wasnt expecting to see such large gains early on
881213 its a testament to what kids can do i believe the children in the district of columbia can achieve at high levels
881214 i cant wait to see what our scores have done
881215 many kids just go to barnes and noble and buy the 15 95 book and they wont work out of it because its too boring so we were really tasked with what can we do differently to interest the kids
881216 its hilarious the students asked our english teacher the definition of a word that was derived from the french
881217 he didnt know and tried to play it off and the kids loved it when they see it on the television theyll remember it
881218 are we testing a much broader portion of students than other school systems of the students who took the sat what percentage are first time college goers from their families
881219 im hopeful some of the things weve done will help increase scores
881220 we have thousands of highly qualified dedicated teachers and paraprofessionals serving dcps students everyday
881221 unfortunately complying with federal law is not optional and we thank those dcps employees who have worked diligently to meet the requirements
881222 there are some very good teachers who are included in this group and students are going to be without their services
881223 in the big picture i think we were all very excited
881224 we did very well despite monsoon season in maryland and the performances went beautifully
881225 its a little frustrating but for a first year i think its what one can expect
881226 the venue was beautiful in terms of the performances but the infrastructure to support it was a challenge
881227 immigration is becoming more and more complex and its going against immigrants rather than for them
881228 immigration is just one part of a much broader story about globalization of movement of goods and movement of people and movement of ideas and what used to be a backwater of the law has become mainstream
881229 were a country of immigrants and yet were putting immigrants out
881230 its a continuation of the civil rights movement and it feels like its in our hands to do something about it
881231 major projects might get started in summer but will continue in the school year
881232 we cannot have the italian program eliminated it is too important to us
881233 i have kids that love italian and would love to take it to that level and it is an intellectual level of work that they deserve
881234 look if you take away the italian ap now you are breaking the program
881235 i dont know where i am in this generational timeline
881236 people resist labels more among the millennials because theres more subcultures
881237 its a fragmented culture in a way that its never been you know how baby boomers ask wheres the protest music and lament the lack of youth activities there is protest music but its so broken up into niche audiences that it doesnt gain as much traction
881238 thats my concern we didnt get a greatest generation book
881239 existe una leyenda vaga en absoluto veros mil ni confirmada por nadie que puede o rse una y otra vez en los campos en alg n lugar del archipi lago existen diminutas islas paradisiacas nadie las ha visto nadie ha estado en ellas y si alguien las ha visto guarda silencio no habla de ellas dicen que en aquellas islas fluyen r os de leche entre orillas de jalea que en ellas los zeks se alimentan como m nimo con crema de leche y huevos dicen que all reina la limpieza que siempre se est caliente que el trabajo es de tipo intelectual y super secreto y a una de esas islas paradisiacas denominadas sharashkm en el argot de los presos fui a parar en mitad de mi condena a ellas debo el haber salido con vida pues en el campo no habr a sobrevivido el plazo que me restaba a ellas debo el poder escribir este ensayo de investigaci n literaria aunque no tengo previsto en l un espacio para ellas ya escrib una novela sobre este tema fue yendo de isla en isla de la segunda a la tercera y luego a la cuarta cuando tuve ocasi n de ser trasladado con escolta especial ramos dos guardias y yo si es cierto que a veces las almas de los muertos flotan entre nosotros que nos ven y pueden leer sin dificultad nuestros insignificantes anhelos mientras nosotros no podemos verlas ni sospechamos su presencia incorp rea lo mismo ocurre con los transportes bajo escolta especial te sumerges en el mundo de los libres en lo m s profundo te codeas con la gente en el vest bulo de la estaci n examinas con mirada ausente los anuncios completamente seguro de que ya no te ata en te sientas en un banco de estaci n de los de antes y escuchas conversaciones extra as e intrascendentes que cierto marido le pega a su mujer o que la ha abandonado que no se sabe por qu la suegra no se aviene con la nuera que los vecinos del apartamento comunal dejan encendida la luz del pasillo y no se restriegan los zapatos en el felpudo que alguien le est haciendo la vida imposible a otro de su trabajo que a uno le ofrecen un buen puesto en otra ciudad pero no acaba de decidirse como si fuera tan f cil mudarse y mientras escuchas todo esto unos escalofr os de rechazo te recorren la espalda y la cabeza hasta tal punto percibes ya con toda claridad la aut ntica medida de las cosas en el universo la medida de todas las debilidades y de todas las pasiones y a esos pecadores les est vedada esta percepci n s lo t incorp reo est s aut nticamente vivo est s verdaderamente vivo y esos otros creen estar vivos pero se equivocan
881240 youth radio commentator jordan monroe reflects on weapons as fashion
881241 if you find yourself in this book and dont like what you see at least its not all your fault blame marketing and thank walker for the insights
881242 basically the idea would be to have the federal government buy up many of the countrys oldest most polluting cars and scrap them the owners who would likely be lower income individuals would be paid at above market prices and allowed to spend the money however they would see fit
881243 the successful cities of the future would need to be smaller have walkable neighborhoods and be close to reliable food and water supplies he ticked off the names of a few cities that he thought wouldnt survive in this new climate including phoenix and las vegas

881269 we believe the olympic committees should have addressed this problem months ago when consumer complaints first arose not last week after the deadline for legitimate ticket holders to transfer olympics tickets passed that policy only compounds the problems of the victimized consumers who still hope to attend the games

881282 since effecting our business plan in mid december 2007 amax has consistently generated approximately 20 of the monthly vip rolling chip volume in the macau market and we believe we can continue to maintain this market share going forward
881283 we remain confident in our ability to deliver a monthly run rate of between hk 40 billion hk 50 billion in rolling chip volume with the biggest constraint on growth coming from restrictions on the addition of new gaming tables
881284 in addition following the expected implementation of a commission cap of 1 25 of rolling chip volume competition for vip players in the market will be based on the quality of each gaming facility as well as the liquidity available to be extended to junket promoters we believe the stability that will be established following the implementation of a commission cap will play into amaxs strength as we operate in one of the finest vip facilities in the world and have the ability to extend liquidity in a risk free manner
881285 amax is principally engaged in gaming and entertainment business in macau

881291 it is better to be tried by twelve than carried by six
881292 a good rule of thumb is if you are trying to kill someone never assume the wound is lethal unless you have hit their brain if you are trying not to kill someone but instead to incapacitate never assume that a wound is nonlethal until the person is in the care of a medical professional even a wound to a limb can prove fatal from blood loss or infection you should definitely practice with your gun and this can take the form of joining a local militia hunting or just practicing at a target range generally speaking if you are not an experienced shooter aim for the upper chest area as it is a large target with vital organs in it this goes double for shooting in self defense as a shot to the chest is the easiest way to stop an attacker

881336 the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
881337 theo is ahead of what he was doing at this period last season and he is still 19
881338 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
881339 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances
881340 his first touch is much better and he moves the ball quicker his penetration and final ball is better
881341 there is goalscoring potential in him and i hope he gets it out of him

881365 in this sense balzac is a quintessential realistic novelist since nothing drives sentimentality out of a novel like exact sums of money and monetary anxiety is a common feature of novel plots both because the opposing temptations of greed and true feeling offer efficient moral choices for characters and because authors themselves are often writing for a living and pressed for money and so monetary questions are interesting to them

881476 every people must answer morally for all of its past including that past which is shameful answer by what means by attempting to comprehend how could such a thing have been allowed where in all this is our error and could it happen again it is in that spirit specifically that it would behoove the jewish people to answer both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them not to answer before other peoples but to oneself to ones consciousness and before god just as we russians must answer for the pogroms for those merciless arsonist peasants for those crazed revolutionary soldiers for those savage sailors

881478 if we look far into the future one can see a time in the 21st century when both europe and the u s will be in dire need of russia as an ally
881479 and for me its about maintaining my approach and letting the results take care of themselves
881480 thats a good question but i dont have a choice
881481 weve got to get on a plane and weve got to go play kansas city its not a matter of if i want to leave here or not we have to
881482 again hes given us a lot of production in a limited situation hes gotten some big hits some timely hits and hes blended in well mixed in with the veterans and hes helped us win
881483 obviously billy muellers a great hitter because hes a guy who won the al batting title
881484 but the guy i grew up watching was carlos guillen when he was with the mariners now with detroit but any time you can get compared with a guy whos won the batting title its flattering
881485 he was a switch hitting shortstop i mean thats pretty much it i always respected the way he approached a game was a patient hitter and just got the job done
881486 then i saw the ball was carrying and got over gonzalezs head and i just kept running
881487 im not saying that they made the wrong call by playing me in but i hit the ball well and got a triple out of it got it over his head
881488 ive always been taught to hit it where its pitched
881489 and when im swinging the bat well thats what im doing
881490 any opportunity you get up here no matter if its short or long you want to show people what you can do
881491 i didnt show up and say this is my time i just came with the same approach that ive had my whole career for me as long as i take care of my approach then the results will be there in the end
881492 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
881493 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
881494 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play
881495 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail pulling issue for us
881496 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
881497 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
881498 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
881499 that just puts it in perspective there is a lot of excitement going on right now with the fans
881500 so i felt i was able to pitch well overall if possible i wanted to keep throwing into the seventh inning but with the rain and everything even if i were able to stay in the game that would have been the end to my start and i just wanted to focus on going deep into the game in my next start
881501 i did talk about creating more variety in my pitching after my last start and i did feel that i was able to do that
881502 at the same time i think there were some spots today when i think i could have pitched with a little more straightforward approach and i think in terms of that and keeping my pitch count down its something im going to continue to work on
881503 i feel that ive learned how to deal with my fatigue between starts
881504 im more assertive getting more rest that i need its hard to say how things are going to play out but especially with my injury in the first half mild right rotator cuff strain i want to be extra cautious about staying healthy for the rest of the season
881505 i spent the entire part of the rain delay taking lefthanded swings in the cage then i come out and theres alan embree
881506 the guys we have in this room are the guys were going to be playing with from here on out we feel good about that we have to continue to compete get quality at bats pitch quality games i think everyone in here likes where were heading
881507 where we are at the present means that were good
881508 to go where we need to go and where we want to go we have to pitch like we did the last three games
881509 we won our last three road games at seattle thats what we have to dwell on not what we did before that on the road we have to take the same mind set that we have at home to the road if we do that well continue to win games
881510 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward and just attacking whats at hand
881511 we did that very well daisuke came out and threw his fastball stayed in his delivery and the ball came out of his hand real well he looked like he was pitching with confidence we played with energy it was a good day
881512 the momentum will carry over tomorrow if clay buchholz takes it and goes deep
881513 thats always the case in this game the momentum goes as far as our starting pitcher allows
881514 in limited at bats hes gotten some big hits some timely hits but hes played the game and blended in like our young guys do mixed in with some veterans hes helping us win games
881515 were going on this trip in a good frame of mind
881516 weve created a better feeling for ourselves we know what we have to do and we feel we have the players that we can do it with
881517 i think everyone is on the same page i think its going to be a fun couple of months ahead
881518 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it
881519 ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business

881533 we are for peace we are for honorable and long lasting peace christians and muslim live in harmony and peace in zamboanga city and we respect each other culture and religion
881534 this issue of ancestral domain again cropped up we are appealing to the government peace panel to listen to our calls we are part of mindanao we are part of the philippines we are filipinos and we should thread what binds us together and not our differences we do not believe that a juridical entity should be created out of religion or base on segregation here we should live together and in harmony
881535 we are very pleased with our strong execution in the second quarter across all geographies and target markets further validating that our strategic approach is on the right track
881536 we believe that continued commitment to driving mcafees three primary initiatives extending leadership in endpoint security interlocking security for the endpoint network and risk and compliance and securing emerging platforms including virtual environments and the web will position the company for continued industry leadership and solid performance in the second half of this year
881537 with our pending acquisition of reconnex mcafee expects to redefine the entire data protection market by bringing together a leader in an emerging segment with our comprehensive portfolio of data protection technologies we expect that reconnexs unique ability to learn and automate ongoing data protection will enable us to leapfrog other data protection vendors reinforcing mcafees leadership position in security

881542 father lately ive felt like peter must have felt when he started walking on the water towards you
881543 o you of little faith why did you doubt in those few words you let him know that even though the storm was great he did not need to fear the waves for you were right there with him
881544 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life
881545 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
881546 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
881547 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in jesus christ our lord
881548 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
881549 but god who is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in sin made us alive together with christ for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
881550 that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead you will be saved for with the heart one believes to righteousness and with the mouth confession is made to salvation for whoever calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved

881558 the deal brings together two companies that clearly know each other they have a formal partnership dating back a dozen years and ibm is ilogs largest partner while the deal fills obvious gaps in ibms websphere process server product line it also provides a timely exit path for ilog whose margins have flattened over the past year
881559 ilogs brms gives ibm a stronger rules engine filling a gap in websphere process server while websphere already offers a rudimentary capability ilogs flagship jrules product provides the ability to embed far more complex rules that can be automatically triggered and reused by multiple business processes inclusion of a brms is part of a larger debate inside the bpm community as to whether you can separate a business process from its rules pegasystems has long competed on an architecture that directly embeds a complex rules engine while rivals such as software ag and until now ibm have relied on ilog or others like fair isaacs blaze advisor for customers with highly complex rules
881560 while ibm cannot yet legally disclose integration plans its an obvious guess that it will natively embed the rules engine not only inside process server but also in other offerings such as filenet websphere business events and websphere business fabric
881561 although consistently profitable for the past seven years currency fluctuations and a slowdown in its brms core market financial services have hit ilogs margins hard furthermore with three sharply distinct product families and markets and only 180 million in revenues ilog could not give brms the focus it deserved while brms was aimed primarily at the enterprise market the other lines were more oem driven comprising a mix of large and small ticket items on closer inspection there was a tenuous link optimization customers with highly complex supply chains could use a sophisticated brms and the visualization engine to make decision making more intuitive ilog was also trying to recast optimization as an enterprise sell nonetheless the oem business explains how a sub 200 million company could count more than 500 partners
881562 as with any deal of this size there will be oem and channel issues ilogs charter membership in microsofts business process alliance thanks to an ambitious rewrite rather than port of jrules that runs natively in the net environment will likely become history ilogs situation is analogous to rationals which also had an extensive microsoft relationship when it was bought by ibm similar issues could arise with supply chain optimization which is used by most major supply chain management application vendors but none of these channel issues are show stoppers compared to the opportunities afforded by native access to the vast websphere customer base

881572 there has to be a reasonable relationship between the needs created by a development and the actual cost the developer is made to pay to address those needs
881573 vindicating but i feel bad about how they the county abused me and abused their power

881594 there are so many benefits to be derived from space exploration and exploitation why not take what seems to me the only chance of escaping what is otherwise the sure destruction of all that humanity has struggled to achieve for 50 000 years

881634 the last few days have been a rollercoaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
881635 mr mcdonnell had climbed everest in 2003 but was unsuccessful during an attempt on k2 in 2006
881636 i was on numerous expeditions with ger and he was one of the best climbers in the world
881637 he was safe fast and strong but that isnt anything in the face of nature
881638 gerards love of mountain climbing was surpassed only by his love for his family and friends

881698 if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out and cast it from you for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and cast it from you for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell
881699 there are those who have known the pardoning love of christ and who really desire to be children of god yet they realize that their character is imperfect their life faulty and they are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been renewed by the holy spirit to such i would say do not draw back in despair we shall often have to bow down and weep at the feet of jesus because of our shortcomings and mistakes but we are not to be discouraged even if we are overcome by the enemy we are not cast off not forsaken and rejected of god no christ is at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us said the beloved john these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous 1 john 2 1 and do not forget the words of christ the father himself loveth you john 16 27 he desires to restore you to himself to see his own purity and holiness reflected in you and if you will but yield yourself to him he that hath begun a good work in you will carry it forward to the day of jesus christ pray more fervently believe more fully as we come to distrust our own power let us trust the power of our redeemer and we shall praise him who is the health of our countenance

881719 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey

881721 we hope this trial will be viewed as timely and beneficial research in an area where there is clearly a demonstrated need for safe and effective products to treat cold and flu in children who suffer from these ailments much more than adults
881722 these results are promising and support the development of a childrens formulation
881723 current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use nhps
881724 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
881725 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
881726 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
881727 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
881728 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia
881729 i think we need to be more proactive and think a little bit outside the box for the benefit of everyone

881790 a humanitarian crisis looms yet the government of zimbabwe continues to suspend most nongovernmental organizations access to vulnerable people in dire need of life saving humanitarian assistance

881852 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
881853 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great

881901 in belgi stellen we een hoger sterftecijfer vast in het wielrennen
881902 laten we wel wezen bloedcontroles zijn niet het middel om epo te bestrijden de hematokrietgrens ligt hoog 50 rds bovendien haal je zon hoge grens niet met epo alleen de colombianen zitten er bijna allemaal boven wegens hun verblijf op grote hoogte en ook onze eigen glenn dhollander zit er van nature boven rds hooguit worden nu de excessen weggesneden
881903 h t probleem zijn de grote rondes epo laat ook de recuperatie vlotter verlopen in grote rondes komt een museeuw er niet meer aan te pas dat was vroeger wel het geval er wordt inderdaad harder bergop gereden dat hoef je niet te loochenen dat is het gevolg van de betere voorbereiding en de medicamenteuze begeleiding
881904 het zijn echt dus alleen nog de onnozelaars die zich bij de meting van hun bloeddikte laten vangen
881905 met een paar communiqu s komen jullie er niet vanaf
881906 precies tien kilometer zo ver reikte het nieuwe wielerseizoen voor de negentienjarige kenny vanstreels toen hij op 2 maart 2003 aanzette in de omloop van haspengouw hij werd immers onpasselijk en moest het peloton laten gaan hij werd gepasseerd door de ziekenwagen en nam dus maar plaats in de rennersbus enkele ogenblikken later overleed hij hartstilstand ook als junior was vanstreels al eens ten val gekomen omdat hij onwel werd
881907 in mijn laatste jaar als prof bedoelt hij dus dat is in 1996 rds heeft een verzorger van brescialat me dan in contact gebracht met een italiaanse dokter hij zou me met epogebruik begeleiden in ruil voor tweehonderdvijftigduizend frank alleen voor het einde van het seizoen maar ik heb het niet gedaan indertijd had je al die plotse hartdoden in het peloton zestien als ik me niet vergis patrice bar gert reynaert bert oosterbosch heel wat renners zijn in hun slaap gestorven ik beweer niet dat het allemaal aan epo te wijten was ik ben geen dokter maar toen vermoedden heel wat insiders dat het met het onoordeelkundig gebruik van epo te maken had javais trop peur ik ben er afgebleven
881908 ik kon niks het was dan ook de eerste keer dat ik cortisone heb genomen de volgende ochtend kon ik een hoge c zingen dat is gewoon niet normaal angstaanjagend en nadien ben je kapot ik heb zelfs een tournee moeten afzeggen je gebruikt zoveel verkeerde energie je hebt dan een opname achter de rug en dan kom je s avonds thuis en dan ga je nog eventjes de vloer dweilen of zo je hypert gewoon maar door met die rotzooi
881909 het verschil tussen wielrenners en atleten ligt in de aard van de training en de verzorging dertig kilometer rond de kerktoren is onzinnig daar kweek je geen goede atleten mee ik heb al dikwijls in de adviescommissie aan de minister het advies gegeven om de kilometers van de koersen voor jongeren op te drijven in hun eigen belang want wetenschappelijk steunt een afstandsbeperking nergens op jonge wielrenners kunnen zich kapot rijden op 30 kilometer dat is veel erger dan 100 kilometer rijden in uithouding in de jeugd moet uithouding worden getraind e n keer ze volwassen zijn kan aan de weerstand gewerkt worden
881910 epo in combinatie met hoogtetraining kan dodelijk zijn daarom wilden bijna geen toppers naar het wk wielrennen in colombia daarom worden de werelduurrecords niet meer op hoogte aangevallen
881911 toen we met pdm begonnen spraken we met elkaar af dat we niet de meest ethische ploeg van het peloton zouden worden wel de beste uitgangspunt voor de pdm directie was geen dopingaffaires en niet geen dopinggebruik binnen die grens konden we experimenteren met producten die op en over het randje waren
881912 er zal altijd een kloof bestaan tussen de ontdekkingen in de medische wereld en de oneigenlijke toepassingen ervan wij moeten wachten tot een product op de markt is voor wij middelen kunnen ontwikkelen om die producten op te sporen zo is het altijd gegaan een treffend voorbeeld vind ik de affaire delgado in de ronde van frankrijk delgado werd in de tour 88 die hij won betrapt op het gebruik van probeniscide probeniscide moest het gebruik door delgado van anabolica maskeren tegelijk was er het plotse ontdekken van het product in de pan american games toen is de helft van de atleten naar huis gegaan zogenaamd omdat iedereen ziek was dat was onzin natuurlijk het verhaal stamde uit een wetenschappelijk onderzoek verricht door een vrij obscuur scandinavisch labo dat publiceerde in een even obscuur wetenschappelijk tijdschrift als je probeniscide neemt kunnen anabolica niet worden opgespoord was de conclusie daar hadden misschien maar honderd mensen in de wereld weet van vakspecialisten en toch ziet men dat tal van atleten probeniscide nemen het kan niet anders of ze worden van informatie voorzien door artsen en wetenschapslui die het met de medische ethiek niet nauw nemen en doelbewust atleten doperen eigenlijk zijn we na ef dat we sancties blijven voorschrijven we weten dat er zwakke schakels zijn en dat die er altijd zullen zijn
881913 daar heb ik nog niet over nagedacht maar gezond kan 100km tijdrijden per ploeg zeker niet zijn
881914 het is moeilijk te stellen of hun vroege dood verband houdt met het feit dat ze ooit actief waren in een 100km ploegentijdrit dat zullen ook wetenschappers nooit met stellige zekerheid kunnen bewijzen duidelijk is wel dat het geen gemakkelijke discipline is ze vergt een heel specifieke en intensieve voorbereiding een ploegentijdrit is niet enkel een gegroepeerde strijd tegen de tijd het is ook een onderling gevecht niemand wil plooien voor de andere en moet dus het hoogst mogelijke ritme volgen en zelf aangeven van de vier waarmee gestart wordt mag immers maar n man afvallen de tijd van de derde van het kwartet is de eindtijd van de hele ploeg dat zorgt voor een zware fysieke maar ook psychische belasting niemand in het viertal wil aangewezen worden als de schuldige voor een nederlaag
881915 gebeurt dit niet in de kliniek dan is hij dood
881916 wellicht bereikte als gevolg van de val immers een bloedklonter het hart
881917 vaak is zon onderzoek niet meer dan driemaal door de knie n buigen en even naar de hartslag luisteren
881918 de doden in nederland en belgi zijn niet het gevolg van epo maar van slecht of onbestaand medisch onderzoek hoe komt het dat weinig of geen italiaanse renners doodgaan omdat de controle veel strenger is hoe komt het dat kanu mocht voetballen bij ajax maar niet bij inter milaan omdat bij ons het hart van een sportman grondig onderzocht wordt die doden zijn het gevolg van hartafwijkingen al of niet aangeboren of veroorzaakt door trainen met koorts die mensen hadden nooit sport mogen doen dat precies zoveel wielrenners dood gaan heeft te maken met de zware belastingen in die sport
881919 when tempted no one should say god is tempting me for god cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone but each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed
881920 blessed is thee for thy thoughts and acts are the same

881925 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come

881930 es mejor arrepentirse de lo que se hace y no de lo que se deja de hacer
881931 hey open your pussy lips and show us some pink
881932 watts does agree that some people are more instrumental than others he simply doesnt think its possible to will a trend into existence by recruiting highly social people the network effects in society he argues are too complex too weird and unpredictable to work that way
881933 traditionally the role of those in the creative and cultural fringes is to lead embracing unusual ideas modes of expression and even products that gradually catch on with the mainstream and the masses by which time of course the fringe has moved on but in a recent reversal of the fringe to mass journey many adventurously creative individuals have lately been in a state of rage mourning and protest over the disappearance of a treasured tool one that years ago reached saturated and then passed out of the mainstream polaroid instant film

882005 there was consideration given to bringing the police dive squad in but the river levels are so high that it would be putting the squad members in danger
882006 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river
882007 they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
882008 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
882009 the application for a final recall order is yet to be heard and that will be decided on the usual basis on information placed before the board when that application is heard next week

882011 those supporting bailey would have preferred that the probation service sought community support and assistance in dealing with that issue rather than recalling him to prison
882012 it was an overreaction as was the police decision to send 13 police officers and a helicopter to arrest him it has the potential to sour baileys future attitude toward authority

882025 the social and professional opportunities in fort lauderdale are huge the real estate prices kept dropping and dropping it made it easier for me to afford
882026 the first of the baby boomers are just barely over 60 now so over the next 10 or 15 years youll see a real increase in that group
882027 lower housing prices could have some impact because historically florida has been a relatively low cost place to live but that has been going up in recent years
882028 florida is going to face a very different racial and cultural gap as the older boomers age and the younger immigrants come with competing demands on public services
882029 a lot of baby boomers will expect social services to be there for them and that wont be the case because funding hasnt kept pace with the need or demand
882030 floridas destiny and its demographics are on a definite collision course unless we have the fortitude to invest in those essential services that will sustain a growing older population
882031 these baby boomers are thinking more about coming here and theyre realizing now is the time
882032 the prices are so much lower right now we got our house for 100 000 less than what is was going for a year ago
882033 i think people got run out of town by the high prices and now that prices and rents are coming down well see more people
882034 im just waiting for the house thats a good bang for the buck that i can make an offer on
882035 with the economy the way it is i will probably have to work so id prefer to be in a place where i can play golf and enjoy the warm weather
882036 i realized how many desperate people there were there and how few jobs
882037 what i was expecting was to actually pick where i wanted to go because it seemed as if jobs were available almost everywhere
882038 my expectations were that i would apply for six jobs and pick one
882039 i thought it would be easier for me because im a male and i want to teach in the inner city

882052 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honourable thing and step down from this board
882053 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
882054 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

882064 when krishna speaks on the battlefield of kuruksetra to the materialistic person it appears that this is simply talk between two friends but actually it is a river of nectar flowing down from the mouth of sri krishna
882065 this joyous life is attained by ones reaction to reading bhagavad gita or srimad bhagavatam
882066 the first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters which are especially protected by the lord
882067 this is the most important instruction in all vedic literature what krishna is saying in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge

882069 just fix your mind upon me the supreme personality of godhead and engage all your intelligence in me thus you will live in me without a doubt
882070 my dear arjuna you are very dear to me and therefore only for your good i will disclose the most secret part of my instructions it is simply this become a pure devotee of mine and give yourself unto me only and i promise you full spiritual existence by which you may gain the eternal right of transcendental loving service unto me just give up all other ways of religiosity and exclusively surrender unto me and believe that i will protect you from your sinful acts and i shall deliver you do not worry any more
882071 but one who fully surrenders unto the lord to render service unto him out of spontaneous love for him factually assimilates the essence of all knowledge described in the vedas one who adopts this method very skilfully attains perfection of life at once
882072 our hearts are meant for the pastimes of the supreme personality of godhead
882073 such a direct instruction is more important than any vedic instruction or even regulative principle

882080 the restructured board is eminently qualified to lead territory forward on its continued growth path as a strong australian iron ore producer and exporter leveraging off our core capabilities in mining processing and exporting high quality minerals
882081 the board has set three clear objectives namely increasing production to a targeted annualised level of 2
882082 the problem is not that some costs will rise but that at the moment there is no discussion of the need to compensate the state and territory governments
882083 nearly one and a half billion dollars per year could employ more than 15 000 teachers or nurses
882084 the commonwealth has said that it will compensate households and polluters but it looks to us as though the state governments have got a much stronger case for compensation than the big emitters
882085 we have received a letter from the guinean president indicating that our concession is under review
882086 we believe that the convention which was passed by the national assembly of the people of guinea is a valid act
882087 we believe weve followed all of the legal requirements and obligations of that convention
882088 the letter purports to indicate that the convention is being converted back to exploration leases
882089 you can bet your life that well take this very seriously and will fight for our rights
882090 weve got 2 000 people working on the project almost all of them guineans
882091 weve poured some 50 million back into the local community
882092 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected
882093 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
882094 it now is obvious to almost everyone that extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt
882095 as i said to the treasurer wayne swan i dont think his outrage is going to do too much good
882096 the best way to do it reduce bank lending rates is through the reserve bank because the reserve bank is in a position to see the balance sheets of the banks and the treasurer isnt
882097 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth
882098 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake

882101 at my first meeting with department officials as minister for immigration i asked who was detained at the immigration detention centre on nauru and at what stage were their claims for asylum i was told there were eight burmese and 81 sri lankans there virtually all of this group had already been assessed as refugees but had been left languishing on nauru when i asked why the eight burmese had not been settled in australia in accordance with international law there was an embarrassed silence eventually the answer emerged the howard government had ordered they stay put they had been left rotting on nauru because the howard government wanted to maintain the myth that third country settlement was possible

882169 by promoting natural planning and female education we have curbed population growth to 2 04 percent during our administration down from the 2 36 in the 1990s when artificial birth control was pushed

882186 para llegar a este punto tuve que involucrarme en la parte digital debido a su dinamismo y su constante cambio adem s de adentrarme en el new management system algo completamente distinto en una agencia tradicional
882187 me parece que el trabajo en tripletas es la manera m s ordenada de obtener resultados satisfactorios para el cliente consumidores y para la agencia misma anteriormente se hablaba de duplas ahora con tres partes en colaboraci n se piensa de distinta manera
882188 en m xico existe un rezago en estos temas aunque ahora grupo w haya obtenido un cyber lion lo cual es producto de la experiencia por tal motivo hacemos nfasis en estos t picos de la tecnolog a digital

882210 said sayed zacharia a taxi driver who was near one of the blast sites
882211 everyone heard ringing in their ears and fear in their minds
882212 a stronger law would help but we also really need to find out if there is a central brain behind all of these bombs
882213 for that we ourselves need a central brain to investigate them in india people have been demanding this for a long time and political parties have not done this
882214 many concerns that the intelligence community voiced that made it difficult to prosecute leaks
882215 the showing that the danger exceeds the value of disclosure is a complete imponderable
882216 that would require the government to come in and basically make a bad problem worse by articulating precisely how threatened disclosure could cause yet more harm
882217 what im not willing to do is to take steps that will essentially do more to protect leakers than it does to protect journalists

882636 between the obama staff and the democratic party staff there will be several thousand

882666 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time

882671 if there is are one or more persons who make your world a better place just because they exist and who you would not have met in real life or not without the internet then post this same sentence in your journal
882672 im actually more prepared for likely eventualities than he is
882673 how would i feel if someone said that to me
882674 the rest of the world is so very very threatening
882675 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
882676 we have been pulling out our staff on a gradual basis anyway in preparation for a prolonging of this dispute
882677 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mount kumgang and the area under military control from now on
882678 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 percent or so still is very useful for us
882679 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
882680 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
882681 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year the voting also gives us the chance to see how the digital voter list works
882682 at least two candidates have been arrested for paying money to voters
882683 despite all the government talk of finding new leaders and clean candidates the polls have become a showdown between the two main parties and their disgruntled leaders
882684 the government has managed to clean up the electoral process by framing new rules and compiling digital voter lists but it has failed to create conditions for relatively clean efficient and visionary candidates
882685 olympic gold is the only one missing from the set
882686 they have dominated the circuit for the past couple of years and are co favourites with the chinese but i think they will pull it off
882687 after four years of preparations xu dongxiangs rowing skills have been enhanced a lot and she is in very good form now
882688 i would love to be designated the flag carrier at the opening ceremony because no australian rower has ever been given that honour
882689 the olympics are beautiful and this is the first time i can participate
882690 i was shot at here by a sniper in this stadium and i wasnt killed because thank god i happened to be running
882691 there were several assassination attempts on our way home car bombs and explosions
882692 many times when we were driving home we were followed by gunmen who started shooting at us it was her insistence that pushed me to continue working with her she is really a brave girl
882693 participation in the olympics means a lot to me because i will represent an entire country not just myself
882694 when i heard about our elimination from the olympics on the television i cried for two and a half hours
882695 i was so depressed because i felt that everything i had worked for under such difficult conditions had vanished
882696 but after we were allowed to participate in the games life came back to me i was as happy as child and during a party at my home my happiness was indescribable
882697 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
882698 in the mens competition i dont think any other team could be better than them
882699 the womens competition will be very close of course the best will win but its a great advantage to have the olympics in your country you have a lot of support which is great
882700 it would be difficult for everybody else to get a hand on the medals
882701 yang wei is the favorite hes the guy to beat
882702 if yang wei has his most spectacular day its going to be very difficult to beat him
882703 when the world record is broken it is a concern for him liu
882704 i believe at least five guys can win in beijing but liu is the favourite he is the guy to beat
882705 the biggest threat for me are the younger competitors like robles from cuba and american david oliver
882706 in the last two years these guys have really improved and oliver has broken the 13 second barrier
882707 in athens i was among the younger hurdlers so i had to fight for a good result
882708 at that time i was fighting against others but this time other hurdlers are aiming at me so i will need a very high level result
882709 there will be pressure at the beijing olympics but i will have the home field advantage

882718 we are doing our best to avoid any open burning here in the country
882719 vietnams illegal trade in wildlife continues unabated and affects neighbouring countries
882720 hanoi is the cultural and political centre of vietnam where wildlife protection and conservation policies are issued and implemented
882721 this suggests that the gap between policies and implementation of wildlife protection is still big
882722 many high profile animals of global conservation concern such as tigers bears or rhinos can still be bought on the market provided prior notice is given and that the price negotiated is high enough
882723 any type of medicinal animal if ordered sufficiently in advance
882724 well organised each claiming that they were shielded from investigations through protection by enforcement personnel
882725 we believe its readily achievable and were well on the way to getting there
882726 while most of australian aquacultures 793 million value is produced in south australia and tasmania now opportunities are clear for queensland western australia and the northern territory where access to suitable farming sites is available
882727 apart from our own local market it is the asian european and american markets which are hungry for quality australian seafood
882728 aquaculture will play a major role in meeting this demand
882729 the wild catch sector cannot meet demand for this premium product so farmed product will step up to fill the gap
882730 farming fish can also be done year round and so is not restricted to seasonal cycles as in the wild
882731 the fishermen earn additional income by conducting recreational fishing activities like leasing out their boats and ferrying anglers
882732 the department receives some 1 000 reports on trawler intrusions nationwide
882733 first the move is to boost the nations fish resources and secondly to prevent intrusions by the trawler fishermen particularly during the monsoon season
882734 im pregnant and my parents are kicking me out of the house where can i get help
882735 what would be the best method of birth control for me
882736 nervous laughter what so what are you saying that people even in a marriage should only have sexual intercourse the number of times that equals the number of children that they want so if they want 3 children theyll have sex 3 times in their entire lives
882737 but we think sex is an important part of a marriage but you must be open to having children every time you do it
882738 if you are trying to make abortion illegal and making contraception too expensive for many women to afford thats kind of ridiculous isnt it
882739 because people are going to have sex and women are not going to have anymore children than they want so women will be forced to undergo dangerous procedures in back alleys just like they did pre roe and
882740 i bet theyll do an encore this time they didnt in dallas and play my immortal
882741 clinical research for the development and evaluation of new treatments for postpartum conditions including new biological agents
882742 the rate of natural embryo loss after conception in unassisted human reproduction is high some suggest as high as 80 percent and the fact of natural loss is fairly well known so that persons who engage in or permit the pursuit of conception through unassisted reproduction are knowingly bringing about the conception of many embryos that will die moreover they suggest the high rate of natural embryo loss should bring into question the views of those who believe that early stage human embryos merit equal treatment with human children and adults if so many die in the natural course of things how do we not treat natural procreation as a great fountain of tragedy and carnage they argue that the natural rate of embryo loss and our response to it should teach us something about the limited significance of human embryos in the earliest stages
882743 those who worry about early embryonic death should be as concerned about the rhythm method as they are about other forms of contraception like plan b and about embryonic stem cell research dr
882744 the same logic that turned pro lifers away from morning after pills i u d s and pill usage should make them nervous about the rhythm method
882745 even a policy of practicing condom usage and having an abortion in case of failure would cause less embryonic deaths than the rhythm method
882746 nevertheless even if in some cases ecps like plan b work by inhibiting subsequent implantation of a fertilized egg these probably would be outnumbered by other cases in which fertilization of an egg that would not have subsequently implanted naturally is prevented because ecps inhibited ovulation
882747 in the extensive literature we have reviewed no writer has addressed this very significant question in a menstrual cycle on the
882748 we successfully induced ovulation with the sequential adminstration of clomiphene citrate and human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy immediately followed
882749 the post fertilization effect a k a bc causing hostile uterus so embryo cannot implant was purely a speculation that became truth by repetition
882750 in our group the feelings are split we say it should be each doctors own decision because there is no proof
882751 trussell said he supports doctors who say women need to know its possible that emergency contraception may affect embryo implantation
882752 there are only two passages in the bible that speak directly to the issue of abortion and both indicate unequivocally that abortion is not homicide
882753 if any man other than your husband has had intercourse with you may the lord make an example of you by bringing upon you miscarriage and untimely birth
882754 her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away
882755 we didnt buy the fallout franchise to just do fallout 3 and then stop but lets get this one out of the door before we worry about the next one
882756 so i was talking to the public relations guy at a company recently and he asked me so whats up with all this social media stuff
882757 well make you a blog for 2000 and stuff like that that says a lot its one thing to be unsure but quite another to be a naive target for hucksters the assurance that comes from understanding what social media is gets your foot in the door the benefits to your bottom line come soon after

882762 in a mysterious leap of faith the bill says that this condition requires medication to treat it even though such medication has never been proven clinically effective and carries serious side effect risks for the mother and baby including cardiovascular birth defects
882763 will the doctors force the woman to take the drugs
882764 it would very likely lead to forcing women to take certain medications which can have very serious mental side effects it is no coincidence that many of the supporters of this bill are part of the abortion lobby mandating screening of women for postpartum depression is more government intrusion and has an anti family agenda it could even lead to forced contraception sterilization or abortion in the future
882765 it could even lead to forced contraception sterilization or abortion
882766 mothers act seeks to drug expectant mothers with antidepressants to
882767 a new law being considered in the u s congress would attempt to prevent postpartum depression in new moms by drugging them with ssri antidepressant drugs while theyre still pregnant
882768 ssri drugs have never been approved for use on newborns yet this new mothers act will effectively drug unborn babies and newborns with drugs like prozac this will certainly have an impact on their developing brains and the bulk of the research available today shows that the impact will be negative will these children be more prone to violent thoughts and behavior will they contemplate suicide at younger ages and what will be the impact of the drugs on the mother
882769 but in the end it was the big bats that bucked expectations which stole the night
882770 theyre the ones who usually arent paying attention and theyre the least athletic people on the field
882771 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
882772 each year the united states the united kingdom and canada deport thousands of people convicted of various crimes to their countries of citizenship in the caribbean there is a widely held belief in the caribbean that recent crime troubles can be tied directly to the activities of deportees who have learnt criminal behaviour in the developed countries
882773 kawczynskis speech doesnt actually cite a single example of what his complaint is merely assuring his honourable friends that
882774 when someone alleges something as grave as this using parliamentary privilege as a shield yet cant even come up with a single anecdote it is only reasonable to view such allegations with contempt
882775 personally i reckon there would never have been any antipathy towards the poles if all of our children were taught modern history and understood the terrible sacrifice made and incredible bravery shown by the polish people in the battle to defend all of our freedoms in the second world war
882776 i also like the fact that he insisted he had made a

882778 is the son of sir francis chichester who in 1967 and at the age of 65 became the first man to sail around the world single handed
882779 i have great confidence that sen obama will touch the hearts and minds of the children of america and the world just like another former illinois senator did for me
882780 if hes consciously repressing his temper he could be even more tightly wound or maybe at the age of 71 hes begun to grow out of adolescence anyway its worth thinking about
882781 i first met kawczynski at a reception for new mps where he proudly revealed that he would be going on the today programme next morning to announce his support for liam foxs bid to become the next tory leader michael howard having lately stepped down
882782 we dont know each other but let me give you a piece of kind advice at the start of your career dont do that

882793 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
882794 if texas doesnt stop the execution texas is going to be responsible for putting the united states in breach of its international obligations
882795 this is an individual who along with five others brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two young teenage girls
882796 we dont care where youre from if you commit a despicable crime like this in texas youll face the ultimate penalty under our laws
882797 put his foot on her throat because she would not die
882798 jose medellin is nothing more than a poster boy for the death penalty
882799 hes been on death row longer than jennifer was alive
882800 you cant explain what weve been through and what we still have to go through
882801 no behavioral problems and has a list of friends that visit
882802 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice ive grown up behind bars and if the state gets its wish ill die behind a locked steel door
882803 put simply the united states seeks the help of the state of texas
882804 all of a sudden i could hear my wife screaming her head off
882805 i thought there must be a snake or something i went to be confronted by this guy running round like sheet lightning with a gun then it was simply horrific
882806 he made me lie down and made my wife tie me up with ribbon from the curtains this bloke was not on drugs he was quite calm and articulate he took my wife into the kitchen i could hear her saying not that not that at that point he had only touched her
882807 i am not a religious person but my mother died a few years ago and i said mum please help me
882808 i then heard this enormous crack and my husband was sniffling and snorting
882809 the chap said to me would you like me to kill him for you i was terribly british and i said no i would rather you didnt no thank you
882810 he raped me all the time i was concerned that my husband wouldnt see what was going on i was just saying to him stay down stay down the robber then finished what he was doing i didnt dare make eye contact
882811 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
882812 lisa i am pushing as fast as i can on this but i am sure you agree that the last thing we want is for us to start the program and the managed care companies not have their network of providers signed up
882813 i know we want to open as soon as possible with a splash and press coverage but all the pieces have to be in place
882814 i dont want to open a program that embarrasses the governor doesnt meet her commitments has fatal flaws at the start or gets shut down due to inadequacies
882815 all the things that he expressed concern about occurring if they went too fast seem like theyre about to actually happen
882816 it has always appeared and this internal e mail confirms that its more important to be able to claim that something is being done about the problem of the uninsured than to actually have a good program in place that will in fact tackle that problem
882817 and worse the desire to be able to say that they are doing this means an unwillingness to acknowledge the collateral harm to a far larger population
882818 i do think that all sides recognized that there was a july 1 implementation date that the governor was striving for and that was set in statute by the lawmakers
882819 if there was any kind of pressure it was because they recognized on june 4 that the program was set to start in the next few months
882820 getting a new program off the ground is a momentous task particularly in the complex world of health care financing
882821 at the same time the commissioner was also candid about the potential factors and implications involved thats part of his job
882822 in the final analysis the fact is that we had to begin taking applications at some time
882823 while we are concerned about the provider network development we are also confident that the networks will be developed as the number of charter oak enrollees develops accordingly
882824 is an open invitation for sheldon toubman to try and slap us with a cease and desist injunction
882825 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
882826 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
882827 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
882828 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
882829 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients
882830 all elements need to be lined up and working in the same direction if pakistan were to tackle the issue of terrorism
882831 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time

882834 its bad enough having the extra cars on the road but the illegal parking can cause major tie ups not only wasting motorists time but also adding to the pollution that supposedly vexes hizzoner so
882835 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqi is alive
882836 i do not believe that they just found aafia i believe that she was there all along
882837 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
882838 the discovery of reliable behavioural endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
882839 the incredible record of joe dimaggio in the summer of 1941 is unparalleled no one has come close before or since to equaling his streak of hitting safely in 56 games in a row
882840 people have stated that it is the only record in baseball or perhaps even in all of sports that never should have happened statistically speaking while other records can be explained by expected outliers over the long and varied history of professional baseball nearly 150 years dimaggios record stands alone
882841 7 years seven years between 1 1 2000 amp 1 1 2007
882842 7 years seven years between 1 1 2000 amp 1 1 2007
882843 lets do nothing and then blame the president and the rest of the republicans that way the stupid people will vote for us and obama because they think we care
882844 realize the president cannot do a damn thing on his own he needs congress to okay it
882845 we get the space and time and audiences to experiment around here
882846 i liked the atmosphere the people were friendly the people took to me right away seattle is the town where i made my first record and if you ever want to say where i got my start you have to say that
882847 seattle is my favorite city its the first place anyone ever liked me when i played the comedy underground in 1983 i sold out a house for the very first time that was really the beginning of everything for me i feel like i owe my whole career to seattle

882866 if the dollar declines dramatically you have foreign and emerging market equities and a declining dollar may well be associated with inflation but a diversified portfolio would include tips
882867 that means if any of these scenarios play out an investor has sizable chunks of his portfolio that protect against them
882868 you put it in an asset class where you are underweight and take money out of a class that is overweight
882869 there is no way that an individual can go out there and compete with all these highly qualified and compensated professionals
882870 there is nothing that cramer says that can help people make intelligent decisions
882871 he takes something that is very serious and turns it into a game if you want to have fun go to disney world
882872 had a long history of success as a trader and fund manager
882873 if you pursue the sensible long term policy look at it over a 5 to 10 year period dont look at five months

882879 pretend to pull out a credit card hand it to me and ill escort you girls in for free ill give you the card back inside
882880 just be in the now dont resist what is accept what is and youll be free and happy
882881 teaching to just accept what is is like yelling to a one armed man whos drowning just swim
882882 if we spend all of our money and need more
882883 from everyone who has been given much much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much much more will be asked
882884 dont i have the right to do what i want with my own money or are you envious because i am generous
882885 passion does not usually arise from things to which we are accustomed
882886 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
882887 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
882888 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
882889 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
882890 it is good his recovery because i was in brazil for rehabilitation for four months i worked hard every day doing two sessions for six or seven hours every day
882891 i think for me it was very hard but now i forget everything that happened
882892 it was very difficult very hard for me as arsenal were playing very well at the time of the injury scoring a lot of goals and doing good in the table
882893 for me it was very hard as i like playing and this injury means five six seven eight months not playing and that is very hard for any player
882894 he is going to check my leg tomorrow but about playing i dont know before christmas maybe
882895 the truth is that this moment for him is very difficult he is in a lot of pain
882896 we still have to do more tests but it doesnt look good
882897 i think its better to wait and hear what the doctor has to say that will be more complete and clearer but i can say that it is not good he will be out for a while
882898 it could be a cruciate ligament injury well have to wait and see what the professionals say
882899 were going to have to be without him for a bit
882900 we now have go back home and recover our spirits from all this
882901 but it is also something that happens in football all great footballers have had these things and im sure hell be back to normal soon
882902 its an english team and they play with a lot of intensity
882903 these things can happen its the way they play here and you have to accept that
882904 the emirates cup is a tournament with very prestigious teams and they all want to give a good display and win
882905 for that reason we had to be careful not to take risks and thats why the spain internationals didnt play its a pity because its a great tournament
882906 hes a great player and a great person we have to wait and see tomorrow hell have a scan and well have to hope for the best
882907 its very disappointing for him very sad its very sad news and we cannot speak about other players now
882908 we changed a lot of players i think it was in the beginning not really a spectacle
882909 the second half there were much more opportunities for both sides i think we were definitely more lucky than sunderland thats the reason why we won
882910 its true that the english premiership and all the clubs have a lot of money
882911 i think thats why they are strong they have a lot of good players a lot of attention from television etc
882912 for us in holland and smaller countries its difficult to be as strong as they are but we give it a try
882913 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
882914 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
882915 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
882916 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
882917 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
882918 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
882919 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
882920 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
882921 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
882922 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
882923 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
882924 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
882925 if he has the same enthusiasm he had during his playing days i am sure he will do really well
882926 remember the images in this post isnt the same as the steps i given

882962 because the issue which inextricably links the instant petition and gr 170867 is whether the camago malampaya natural gas reservoir is within the territorial jurisdiction of palawan forms part of the national territory of the philippines it would be premature for the court to rule on this case when gr 170867 is still up for adjudication before the supreme court
882963 the task of defining the baseline involves policy determination accordingly ample opportunity must be accorded the legislative and executive departments to forge a policy concensus and to implement them before the courts may intervene under the expanded concept of judicial power in section 1 article 8 of the constitution

883087 it certainly wasnt your typical cd rom presentation as it was meant to communicate about the company products to markets globally it covers all major projects of the real estate giant we need to do it in eight languages from arabic to russian we need to do it highly engaging and we need to do it all in style
883088 however the client deserves our respect as it knows what it wants as a top tier firm should be in fact this wasnt our first engagement with dubai properties it has engaged us for several other projects before this including an interactive marketing kit for its bay square project
883089 are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
883090 our recent investigation of the epa tells us that retaliation is widespread at that agency
883091 so its critical that when the igs office and gao are investigating a wrongdoing employees are able to speak confidentially the work of the ig and gao have repeatedly helped protect the health and safety of americans
883092 to ensure consistency and coordination among those responding to ig and gao reports
883093 a senior staffer in the enforcement office sent out an e mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from the press gao and epas inspector general
883094 there is nothing in the procedure that restricts conversation between enforcement staff the press gao and the ig and the procedure is consistent with existing agency polices

883100 ive never thought of myself as a philanthropist but now i know theres
883101 until several years ago absolutely nobody thought this kind of life was possible it hadnt even made it into science fiction
883102 now its quite possible to imagine a microbe like that living deep beneath the surface of mars
883103 theres been a fundamental shift in the thinking of the scientific community on the question of life forms beyond earth
883104 we now know the number of stars in the universe is something like 1 followed by 23 zeros
883105 given that number how arrogant to think ours is the only sun with a planet that supports life and that its in the only solar system with intelligent life

883122 when im on this stage you know this is my home
883123 they are profiting from a racial slur that has been used to dehumanize people of color for centuries
883124 it is time for nas and other hip hop artists to clean up their act and stop flooding the airwaves with the n word
883125 its probably going to make people uncomfortable i dont expect a lot of people to sell a record called nigger hopefully people can open their minds up and lose some of their fear and deal with it its just an album
883126 its an open active case being worked out of 103rd precinct
883127 the police department right now is at a standstill in the case
883128 im not trying to say that they wont solve it but the longer it goes by in my experience theyre getting to the point where they cant take it any further
883129 they do have some leads but theyre bogged down now
883130 people are really dejected that nothing has happened yet but on the other hand i dont think theres a whole lot of cooperation going on out there in the streets people are very scared
883131 what i know is that people in the hood are absolutely convinced they know who did it theyve known from the very beginning and the investigation hasnt been able to pin it on this guy
883132 the strongest motive they have right now is that jay was killed over that debt
883133 i tend to think the simpler explanations are the better with this case a couple of jays friends told me that the falling out was over some rolex watches that jay went to get with scoon and they wound up getting ripped off scoon blamed jay for the rip off and jay said listen we both got ripped off here supposedly they were both out 15 000 scoon thought jay was part of the rip off
883134 scoon was making phone calls from the south and turning up the heat on jay shortly before the murder
883135 some people were trying to say it was a coke deal but i dont buy that
883136 firstly as far as i can tell jay didnt use drugs maybe smoked a little weed secondly this guy was so street smart i dont think he would have been dumb enough to buy a large amount of coke with these characters i think he also realized he had so much to risk with his family and his business was going well
883137 but people have gone on with their lives and they dont feel like getting involved with this anymore some of them have moved up in the music industry and they dont want to go through the innuendo the negativity in the press
883138 i think the police alienated them somewhat they came in too hard on them but then again thats just the way we act as cops sometimes
883139 rest assured if they had an id theyd have made an arrest by now
883140 hes hired marvyn kornberg a prominent attorney in queens who really knows the lay of the land and is a very smart attorney
883141 hes not cooperating and hes not not cooperating if they want him to come in let them ask him to come in but hes not volunteering to come in and give a statement
883142 there s no requirement that he cooperate or give a statement to the police once you tell me that a client of mine is a target of your investigation hes not making a statement
883143 people who know scoon said they dont think hed do it himself
883144 its real hard you cant wake up in the morning and call your homey
883145 i went into the barbershop that jay used to go to regularly
883146 its just off merrick boulevard right near jays studio the guys in the barbershop told me that ronald tinard washington had come in there recently too they told me everyone in the shop froze when he came in hes a feared guy on the streets people are definitely afraid of him everyone says hes a bad actor and theyre very afraid of him
883147 knew that he was in the studio that night and also knew that he could barge in shoot jay without resistance get out and make a quick escape and this is of course maybe 200 yards from the front door of the 103rd precinct house
883148 randy allen who raps under the name mdr in rusty waters has denied everything but jays friends and jays wife no longer speak to randy they think that he knows more than hes saying because people are wondering how did the killer know that jay was there that night this obviously was a planned hit
883149 thats a cruel thing to do to jam master jay
883150 its real hard because you cant wake up in the morning and call your homey you cant reach out for that advice losing jay changed all our worlds
883151 i dont believe that jam master jays death has anything at all to do with rap
883152 certainly it has nothing to do with anything that run dmc ever said or did and lets not forget jay wasnt a rapper he was a dj it has nothing to do with rap but i do believe it has to do with the american propensity for gun violence which is an epidemic in the black community
883153 they heard the words 50 cents but in street terms that just means 50 000 thats just the street terminology
883154 i cant say its far fetched 50 cents from queens supreme a former drug dealer with alleged financial ties to murder inc comes out of queens murder inc ceo irv gotti comes out of queens
883155 the jam master jay case may be handled by the streets
883156 lets say the nypd hadnt solved the john lennon murder in 12 seconds it would never have got to cold case
883157 typically its the low profile stranger on stranger crimes that dont get solved and become cold cases
883158 ive never been a believer in the notion that because a case gets older it necessarily gets harder to solve
883159 he confessed that he committed the crime because he had copied it from the game he played
883160 he wanted money to play the game his parents who work as civil servants did not have enough money to give him
883161 to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the national firearms registration and transfer record
883162 we worked so hard and put so much into it a qc and barrister doing it pro bono without charge i havent had the guts to read the judgment its quite nauseating
883163 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
883164 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
883165 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
883166 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
883167 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
883168 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
883169 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected senior analyst lee wai tuck said from singapore
883170 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
883171 it now is obvious to almost everyone that extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt he said
883172 as i said to the treasurer wayne swan i dont think his outrage is going to do too much good he said
883173 the best way to do it reduce bank lending rates is through the reserve bank because the reserve bank is in a position to see the balance sheets of the banks and the treasurer isnt
883174 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth he said
883175 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake he said
883176 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it
883177 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision
883178 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
883179 malunya minta ampun apalagi waktu itu kepala sekolah langsung memangkas rambut kami satu persatu mending kalau dibotakin abis beliau malah membuat model enggak beraturan sebelah kepala kiriku botak sebelah kanannya tidak kocaknya tiap anak punya model potongan yang beda beda bener bener enggak bisa terlupakan
883180 senang dan bangga banget waktu itu pihak sekolah langsung memberiku piala namanya juga masih remaja saat itu bukan main senangnya ketika pertama kali menjunjung piala nah sejak itulah aku mulai sering berpikir gimana caranya aku bisa serius di dunia musik
883181 waktu itu sehari dapat rp 10 000 karena enggak biasa ngamen dan cari uang aku langsung pakai untuk jajan rasanya puas sekali jumlahnya sudah cukup besar pada waktu itu
883182 padahal waktu itu penghasilanku sudah lumayan mulai dari rp 50 000 hingga rp 100 000 biasanya aku serahkan semuanya kepada ayah dan ibu
883183 bukannya aku enggak mementingkan pendidikan tetapi keadaan yang memaksaku begini aku pikir mengamen lebih banyak memberikan manfaat daripada tetap bersekolah aku jadi bisa cari uang sambil terus bernyanyi
883184 enggak ada cara lain aku harus konsentrasi susah dan repot sih tapi biar tambah mantap aku baca doa dulu di balik panggung
883185 masa masa seperti ini yang tidak pernah aku lupakan susah dan senang selalu bersama mulai dari ngamen mabuk ngamen mabuk begitu terus sampai akhirnya suatu hari ayah mengetahui kelakuanku aku dihukum enggak boleh pulang kalau sedang mabuk
883186 pa run out now dont get burnt run out hurry

883188 aku sadar hidup di jalanan enggak gampang dan harus menyelami kehidupan mereka namun aku enggak sengaja menjadi pelakunya suatu hari aku nekat memukul sesama pengamen yang suka mengompas aku karena dia minta setiap hari dan jumlahnya bisa setengah dari hasil kerjaku aku enggak tahan dan protes akhirnya cara itulah yang aku pilih untuk menunjukkan kekesalanku kepadanya
883189 aku pernah berbohong kepada orangtuaku waktu itu aku minta bayaran untuk beli buku di sekolah padahal uang buat beli apa gitu dan enggak ada hubungannya dengan pelajaran sekarang kalau ingat hal itu aku merasa bersalah sekali dengan ayah dan ibu
883190 waktu itu salah seorang temanku bermain bola ya dia ini seraya menunjuk judika
883191 waktu itu aku semakin serius mengamen sekarang dengan anugerah dari nya aku jadi idol dan aku seperti mendapatkan jalan untuk mencari nafkah dengan lebih baik selanjutnya tinggal bagaimana aku menjalani hidupku sebaik baiknya dan membuktikan keseriusanku dengan fanny dalam membina rumah tangga
883192 kami sangat bangga dengan aris keluarga yang tidak kami kenal saat ini datang berhamburan ke rumah kami

883197 i am surprised that he has not appeared before me this case is well publicized and he should have been in court no one is above the law
883198 i met him in a hotel lobby in new york city
883199 and he came in just from the gym and was sitting there and i was like wow
883200 for the most part on the song im saying we gotta take responsibility in our own community some of our people are messing up but it aint for america to tear them down people got on me for supporting mike vick but if america dont support him dont mean i gotta turn my back on him
883201 i hope he can make the best out of that situation if he gets 10 years that aint bad if the security person is already telling its obvious thats their witness they got tapes they got all this if it was me i would have to tell the people i did it and sit down for a minute nobody wants to hear that you have to stay 10 years nowhere its not a good thing period its unfortunate but he got himself in that space i dont know the real facts maybe he didnt do it lets keep our fingers crossed
883202 its obvious he was set up but sometimes when youre in a position of that stature and youre that big you just dont allow that energy around you you have to have people around you to let you know or avoid that energy even if he was a gun collector naturally you get a license to collect thats just common sense at that stage where hes at he dont need to protect himself you hire legitimate law enforcement or you hire people who are licensed to carry guns surround them around you and youll be safe you get to a certain point where they say you can take the kid out the ghetto but you can never take the ghetto out the kid t i was experiencing that for a minute
883203 hes a good man and his situation it could happen to any of us ill say this they have a hip hop task force out there they looking to lock us up for whatever we do we gotta be extra extra clean and we got to watch what we say anything we say can and will be used against us we got to get more conscious on how we moving because you got people out there the black community has moved up to being creative and making money and that means that these cops need jobs and their job is to come and follow us and watch us

883221 its good for everyone involved at the club to not only make the final but also to be hosting it its a first for a new zealand based professional club in this competition and i think thats great for football here and for the competition in general
883222 im sure the fans will really enjoy seeing another game at westpac stadium on wednesday evening
883223 we actually played pretty well there were no real concerns but it was just a couple of blips that resulted in goals but in the second half we were excellent we were pretty much all over them
883224 given that they really only had two training sessions together i thought the back four went well
883225 there was a little bit of miscommunication at times that led to goals but i cant blame them for that what impressed me most is that they got stronger and stronger and grew in stature as the match went on
883226 jeremy got a solid 90 minutes under his belt manny who has never played at a league level before did a good job and siggy was solid from there we were able to create a lot of pressure and we had lots of ball in the second half overall it was very pleasing
883227 weve still got some decisions to make and its important that we dont get too caught up in the emotion of making the final

883273 i am still finding it hard to believe that he did all of this
883274 i have never ever thought that he was capable of killing these women and i cannot believe it now i cannot see him strangling a girl naked and taking her down a road in a car and chucking her in a ditch he could not kill a rabbit
883275 if he was a violent boy and in trouble with the police all the time then i could understand it but he was not like that he was just a normal boy full of mischief and that is why despite all of the evidence against him i cannot see him doing it
883276 he has had his court case and he has been refused an appeal before it seems to me that it is what prisoners do once they are found guilty and receive a life sentence they just come up with these appeals and it seems like a hobby for prisoners wasting peoples time
883277 but i hope that he gets another hearing if it happens i will be there i want to go and see what he thinks a fair trial is but if i get close to him he will probably run a mile when he sees me i will look at him and see if he looks at me if he is guilty he will not enter the room
883278 i was given a seat with the families in the main court room but i did not want to sit next to the men and women whose daughters had been murdered so i sat in the annexe with the media
883279 it was unbelievable what he was coming out with about his sexual habits especially when they said he was going golfing and then going to a massage parlour and paying them 60 but that he could get it cheaper from girls on the streets
883280 i just could not believe that he was doing that just think if i had been sitting in that other court room with the families when he was spouting all of this
883281 he stood up in court and said he was driving around the red light district in the early hours of the morning because he could not sleep but that is rubbish as far as i am concerned he also said he was laying the girls on his jacket on the floor of the bedroom having sex with them but i do not believe that for a start
883282 it could be possible that he did the norwich ones girls were killed in norwich that have never been found and clothes from the girls murdered in ipswich have never been found so if someone can hide bodies that can never be found then they can hide clothes
883283 if he admits to me that he is guilty of the ipswich murders then it is possible i suppose but what you are saying is that i have sat here in my home talking to somebody who has committed murder two or three times if he had murdered those girls from norwich how can he come and sit here and watch tv and come to the cricket with me i cannot see it
883284 what i said was that i would probably feel the same as the victims families if my daughter was killed and some of them said he should be hanged but i also said that that could be the easy way out maybe life in prison is more of a punishment
883285 everybody treats me well people seem to go out of their way to be nice i get fussed a lot of the time maybe it is because people feel pity for me
883286 i went to court to find out the truth and i have got to accept how it finished
883287 he is gone i have got to believe what happened and that there is nothing i can do to change that but i will never believe he was capable of doing it unless he tells me himself
883288 the qualifying game in the ncaa tournament to become the 64th team
883289 i had just got home and was in the kitchen when i heard a bang i saw all different people flying out of their doors
883290 i came out of my house and went into autopilot i checked her pulse and we put a dressing gown over her and a towel on her head where i could see she had cut herself
883291 i was talking to her telling her she would be alright although i did not know if she could hear me it was terrible so awful and so so sad
883292 the lady in the car was in shock but she could not have done anything the little girl just walked out into her car the girl was catapulted back and flew about a metre or so
883293 it was a hell of a bang and a man was shouting
883294 the girl had gotten off a bus before crossing the road
883295 she was then in collision with a car which was travelling along byron road in the direction of macaulay road we are treating this as a serious collision and are investigating the scene as best we can while we have the opportunities
883296 the reason its being done is because that particular stretch of road has been identified by surveyors as needing a complete overhaul and the county and borough have both agreed that it should be in the programme
883297 it is not a stretch of road that can do with just patching up or tinkering around because it is a busy road
883298 it will break up more quickly than other stretches of road so it is a high priority

883346 i hope the walk of fame committee will give serious and thoughtful consideration to his nomination this june and we can all help by simply picking up a pen and writing a letter of support
883347 i wanted star trek phase ii to feel as if it were the fourth season of the original series
883348 and with world enough and time i feel we achieved that but ive never been fully satisfied with our work on to serve all my days as it was not exactly as i envisioned it
883349 there were many things i wanted to do but circumstances at the time forced us to go in a different direction

883351 i have always thought that the visual effects done by jo l bellucci and dave berry for the episode were fantastic considering the tremendous time constraint they were under but we have all grown and added skills to our toolbox that we unfortunately didnt have at the time we produced our second episode
883352 although the new special edition of to serve all my days will feature updated visual effects by daren dochterman and jo l bellucci it will now have original series music consistent title sequences and added vintage commercials and will appear just as it might have been if it had aired on a night in 1969
883353 walter and writer dorothy d c fontana deserve the extra effort being put forth for this very special episode and there will be an added surprise at the end for the fans

883430 if the chinese market continues to grow that will be the end of the stock
883431 around 80 percent to 85 percent of bluefin tuna caught in the mediterranean is exported to japan
883432 this stock has now collapsed thanks to over fishing and the japanese turned their attention to the atlantic bluefin tuna

883435 but the turkish tuna seiners continued to fish and there is always the illegal fishing by japan and south korea

883449 i was pretty average at the start and got better as time wore on but the england team need a leader to guide them in the right direction
883450 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
883451 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
883452 i really believe that these can be the best years of my playing career
883453 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
883454 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings

883515 but i dont think its completely dead i believe microsoft will come back around next year and try again
883516 i believe it is simply due to microsofts weakness in its online services division you look at their last quarters numbers for that group and its clear that they are falling further behind their desktop business also showed deceleration yahoo helps with both problems
883517 i had never used microsoft search before a couple of weeks ago
883518 when i want to google or find yahoo i know what to punch in simple as that

883543 there are about 110 architecture schools in the nation and only twenty have doctorate programs of those we also have one of the largest i saw here the opportunity to integrate disciplines teaching and research
883544 when i first came to a amp m 95 percent of our students were from texas three quarters after they graduated went to work in texas
883545 last year we had 70 aggies working and interning to build the new american embassy in beijing this program has changed everybodys lives they love it many of the students say that their semester abroad was their best semester here

883574 deutschland ist beim thema b stenhalter ein entwicklungsland ich begegne in meiner praxis t glich frauen deren bhs berhaupt nicht passen schlecht sitzen oder schlicht und einfach ausgeleiert sind
883575 um die richtige bh gr e herauszufinden sollte man direkt unter der brust und auf h he der brustwarzen ma nehmen
883576 die gr en variieren nicht nur von marke zu marke der k rper ver ndert sich auch im laufe des lebens und man tr gt mit 40 nicht mehr dieselbe gr e wie mit 25
883577 manche frauen brauchen in der ersten zyklush lfte eigentlich eine kleinere cupgr e als in der zweiten
883578 bei einem busen mit d cup k nnen schon mal 2 5 kilo pro brust zusammenkommen
883579 sind beispielsweise die tr ger des bhs zu schmal und schneiden ein werden die im schulterbereich zusammenlaufenden nerven und muskeln abgeklemmt das kann zu starken kopfschmerzen f hren
883580 viele frauen kaufen sich den bh in der unterbrustweite zu gro das erkennt man daran dass der b stenhalter im laufe des tages am r cken bis zwischen die schulterbl tter wandert
883581 der bh sollte auch dann nicht rutschen wenn man die tr ger nicht auf den schultern sitzen hat au erdem sollte man ihn so kaufen dass er im neuen zustand im u ersten h kchen passt so kann man ihn immer noch enger machen falls er etwas ausleiert
883582 dann stimmt die ganze proportion nicht mehr und die tr ger rutschen st ndig von den schultern
883583 es gibt keinerlei belege daf r dass brustkrebs durch andauernden druck durch einen bh b gel hervorgerufen wird
883584 die st ndigen ersch tterungen beim sport setzen nicht nur den gelenken zu sondern auch der brust in der brust gibt es keine muskelfasern und das bindegewebe allein ist nicht in der lage die brust bei einer solchen belastung zu st tzen

883590 it also adds a little excitement for the folks who come to the fair
883591 those are the things that enhance it but its really the exhibitors thats the what the fair is all about
883592 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us
883593 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow
883594 after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
883595 i feel good and its progressing and im just working to get back
883596 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
883597 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that hit me three times already
883598 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
883599 i wonder why a guy plate umpire tim timmons thought we were going to hit the guy with the bases loaded this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what commonsense they have when they make those decisions
883600 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
883601 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
883602 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play
883603 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that

883605 afterward if the report is a little positive then thats real important
883606 nah they really dont worry too much about my weight
883607 i think if i were to start dropping a lot or something or get under 285 i think then theyd probably say something to me but for the most part ive leveled out anywhere from 292 to 300 pounds
883608 my weight i dont feel is as much an issue as working on my technique every day and making sure i have that right honestly five or 10 more pounds isnt going to make me that much better of a football player
883609 i think if you look across the league most of the really good centers are about the same size
883610 were all anywhere from 285 to 300 pounds so the biggest thing is they try to put guys who are a little more athletic in the middle guys who can move around and make the calls that need to be made
883611 hes so quick its kind of hard to get your hands on him hes doing a great job
883612 it makes up for him not being such a big guy hes very stout you just cant run up on us and try to be all tall and try to muscle us out because its not going to work hes able to use his technique and get low and get up under
883613 its definitely more of a natural position for me and that was my first time playing guard but having that experience playing guard and understanding the offense a little better and using that in coming back to the center spot has definitely helped me out
883614 its definitely nice getting in there on some of that pass protection youre blocking on a guy and one of our big boys comes and beats him up on the side
883615 i dont think theyre big sloppy guys either they did a good job of getting some guys that definitely have some muscle mass to them and can move around a lot and have a little bit of stamina
883616 hes his own person he dont really care what anybody thinks hes going to do what he feels like
883617 ive got a lot of things in my head like when i travel a lot i just see a bunch of different things that i put in the back of my mind
883618 i try to think about a movie like how people might re enact different characters
883619 i start putting together stories i start getting good grades on it and i just thought about it as that could be one of my hidden talents hopefully one day ill get that out there
883620 were taking things a day at a time but i was able to do good bars today
883621 rainer schuettler claims that he should be allowed to compete in the games considering that he has been entered by the german noc national olympic committee and that he is eligible as a result of his position in the itf computer ranking due to the withdrawal of some players who were qualified for the olympic tournament
883622 dont tell terrell but we will do that with him some day and other guys
883623 they are not hurt but i think if you overwork them or put them in situations you could have a bad result
883624 right now we need to get the fluid out of his knee and get that thing settled down a little bit
883625 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
883626 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
883627 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
883628 i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were done to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me
883629 we just got mired in traffic there at the beginning of the race
883630 and then when it started raining we just pitted and had a good strategy we were in our window right where we only had to pit once at the end if it went green and it went green
883631 we finally got up to run with the guys who ran up front all day
883632 after the slump weve been in its a great feeling to do that again with the success weve had sometimes you can take that for granted a little bit
883633 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
883634 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
883635 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
883636 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
883637 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
883638 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
883639 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
883640 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

883644 weve been to lots of tournaments this is just like that
883645 this is an all day every day kind of deal for us
883646 well go for it more on fourth down more than you can imagine
883647 i expect us to quickly reach greater heights in the kicking game
883648 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
883649 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
883650 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
883651 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
883652 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy
883653 having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
883654 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
883655 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
883656 i had to leave the pit box i was afraid he was going to punch me in the neck
883657 carl said what would you do if you thought we would get the track cleaned off and keep running
883658 we argue we get mad we walk away and then we come back together and cooler heads prevail we have arguments and discussions but then we have handshakes and hugs and we come to terms with what we want to do ninety percent of the time it works out for us
883659 i think right now rick will evaluate him and well plan a sensible campaign
883660 i was concerned at the three eighths pole and it looked like we were beat turning for home
883661 but he got down on his belly and he won though
883662 i thought we had a heck of a shot turning for home i thought to myself we could do this again i am very happy right now we made him run thats for sure
883663 big brown looked great in the paddock and when he broke but down the backside i got excited coal play ran a big race
883664 it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
883665 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out i knew he was going to get there
883666 at the top of the stretch that horse coal play took off but big brown took off after him today he showed hes a warrior

883672 since 25 percent of our bodys total energy goes into moving muscle and 75 percent into regulating heat reducing an athletes core temperature before the marathon or a field hockey match means more energy for the competition itself

883675 how in five or six seconds five or six years has come crashing down
883676 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
883677 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
883678 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
883679 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
883680 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
883681 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america

883685 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
883686 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
883687 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
883688 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
883689 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
883690 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
883691 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
883692 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt
883693 i wish this one on 18 was for the championship that would be the ultimate thats why i spent all that time on the putting green and the driving range those are the moments i miss
883694 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less

883719 well from my perspective its like really bad burning man art
883720 we knew this was one of those things that we needed to act on as soon as possible
883721 so if you add some to one pile you have to try to keep all the other piles the same
883722 i kind of feel like we were strong armed into it
883723 i dont feel like districting is going to change the number of registered voters or the number of candidates
883724 it should actually probably become a standing commission or committee within the city
883725 i think hes having a very good camp as well so it definitely carries over into the next phase and thats why its so important to mike tannenbaum the general manager me and the organization
883726 i just wanted to work out and make strides in the offseason
883727 im really happy with the strides that i made experience plays a big role so you dont make the same mistakes that you did in years prior
883728 brick can take it to another level hes very aggressive hes very smart and hes really good at his technique it takes a little time you start putting things together and all of a sudden you just take off
883729 he came in the office the other day and hes swelled up he looks like hes been spending time with well developed which is great that fullness that he has in his upper body now is translating into a much more powerful hand punch ive been really happy with that
883730 i always set goals for myself of things i want to attain
883731 expectations are always going to be there if there were no expectations we wouldnt bring in guys we wouldnt try to recruit the players we do and we wouldnt make the moves that we did expectations are always going to be there its just a matter of rising to that challenge
883732 those are things that i want to get better at i tried to stick it on franks he ran such a great route i cant have that back but i wish i could those are things that ice the game and you dont give the opponent a second chance
883733 i would say that im progressing towards where i want to be
883734 its still a work in progress but im definitely headed in the right direction
883735 coming out here in a scrimmage situation its not scripted you go out there and play the situations out as they come its a little bit different its a good stepping stone for us to get ready for cleveland this thursday
883736 sooner or later the organization has to make a decision one way or the other and i hope its sooner rather than later i think for our team to be able to move on and accomplish the things we want to get accomplished the things coach eric mangini and mike tannenbaum want to get accomplished weve got to make a decision
883737 you guys are where i get all my favre gossip
883738 were just trying to get through practice rather than practice with a purpose
883739 youve got to be able to deal with those things and still get done what we have to get done
883740 everyone has to uphold their end of the bargain i think there was effort there just werent any results
883741 we understand the feelings of the fans i think we will understand more next week when the actual surveys come back were going to look at the fans response to the questionnaires we sent out were going to try to incorporate as many of those ideas into the way we package the psl program
883742 this is very very critical for us to get this right
883743 i think florham park gives us a tremendous competitive advantage
883744 once i get back on the field ill be fine im not getting behind or anything the offense is the same
883745 i have to let the medical staff handle that ive told the strength coach that i feel great and im ready to go

883873 pero se trata de venir al espacio hipersacralizado e hipersimb lico de la cultura nacional que es bellas artes a hacer una lectura de la literatura que se est haciendo en puebla actualmente de los narradores y poetas j venes en b squeda de un foro nacional y de publicaciones
883874 son quince escritores muy respetables maduros en sus voces muy cabrones si se cumpli el objetivo todav a no lo podemos saber yo creo que la semana pr xima tendremos los elementos para hacer un balance

883877 incluso algunos profesores del collhi se esfuerzan por hacerles entender a lo alumnos que si entran con la esperanza de ser creadores literarios que mejor se salgan de la escuela porque ellos forman investigadores y docentes de bachillerato afortunadamente no se salieron y est n ac haciendo una lectura de su obra

883883 its not a war on terror its a war of terror
883884 but i was also curious it meant something wasnt changing
883885 is that from its origins womens culture has a big critique of male dominance both in the political sphere and at home but it also wants something like the good version of that normativity to be the condition of happiness
883886 in subordinate populations intimate publics the presumption is that the general world is not organized around their flourishing
883887 so hip hop culture is about police and womens culture is about being disappointed in love and with children and at work
883888 if people are returning to something many times it means it has a story to tell that isnt finished

883901 it was really the anthrax letters with the first one sent on september 18 just one week after 9 11 that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after it was anthrax sent directly into the heart of the countrys elite political and media institutions to then senate majority leader tom daschle d sd sen pat leahy d vt nbc news anchor tom brokaw and other leading media outlets that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by islamic radicalism
883902 without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
883903 there has long been an intense desire on the neoconservative right to falsely link anthrax to saddam specifically and muslims generally abc news was and as a result of its inexcusable silence continues to be their best friend

883913 like others i could move here and there without worrying about breaking the figure once i started changing her pose i get serious it has that kind of power face expressions and some parts of her face show her personality really well and some body parts do not expose too much they make me excited
883914 there are 2 kinds of faces this face has the strong power of destruction any kind of pose i let her do is cute i mean it trackback

883922 i will salute that commander in chief ugandans shall choose i will pledge my loyalty and support to him
883923 we can work together on security issues we do not mind which party you belong to we do not mind whom you vote for we only mind your security updf need the people of uganda and ugandans need updf our relationship should be like that of a fish and water
883924 the constitution is clear power belongs to the people once the people decide on what they want for us in updf we shall respect the peoples decision
883925 i dont believe him anyway but if he is genuine with what he says it is indeed a good development because we know aronda is a cadre of the movement
883926 it is unfortunate that president museveni has made all his former body guards army commanders and these are people who owe all their loyalty to him
883927 although updf should serve anybody it may not be possible because all recent election petitions have proved that the army is involved in electoral violence
883928 so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
883929 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
883930 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
883931 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things
883932 people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong
883933 do we want our garbage collectors to be the meter maids of trash

883935 we support the goals of the proposed ordinance but believe it needs refinements to be workable for everyone involved especially the customers
883936 we are concerned about draft provisions that envision our drivers policing the contents of refuse containers and possibly withholding service if violations were found
883937 a significant increase in time required to service each customer location would mean we would need to have more routes which means more drivers trucks fuel and related resources

884334 traditionally social services for people living with hiv were set up by and for gay men
884335 up until fairly recently the vast majority of begins service users were gay men
884336 but in the past five years thats changed dramatically and now the majority are african women who are often asylum seekers or refugees
884337 i hide my hiv status from my neighbours but unfortunately some people around where i live found hiv magazines in my dustbin and stuck them on my door
884338 l had to hide in my flat for quite some time until begin helped me out
884339 i still feel very lonely and keep my windows closed there are people who call me names but you get used to it
884340 with hiv related problems you cant always discuss them with your doctor or your family here you can have non judgemental conversations with staff and other service users
884341 therell be young women and young men out there who are straight and who have hiv
884342 this will be a chance to get together and be on the same wavelength
884343 there is still an epidemic amongst gay men and there is an imported epidemic amongst african people in the uk but those groups arent always distinct
884344 we know for example that african men are over represented amongst homosexually acquired hiv infection so there are often crossovers in infection but thats not often talked about
884345 at the end of the day was used by people to replace actual conclusion making
884346 according to the international business report 2008 by consultancy firm grant thornton international india alone will make up 30 per cent of the worldwide net increase in employment with 142 million new jobs by 2020
884347 the vast middle class strong income growth favourable demographic patterns and organised retailing growth estimated at 40 per cent compounded annual growth rate cagr over the next few years are some of the factors that will drive the retail boom
884348 the need would be around 15 000 20 000 people in each of these retail chains so in all the requirements would touch 80 000 85 000 every year in the next three to four years of which frontline sales staff will be 80 85 per cent
884349 will be in retail specific areas like visual merchandising plannogramming the science of maximising space efficiency in the store and supply chain management retail management graduates and general mbas will be wanted
884350 the percentage of middle class people in metros and tier 2 cities who are buying their own property has increased from about 35 per cent in 2003 to 60 per cent today
884351 this will recreate a need for civil engineers a tribe we forgot during the it boom
884352 the requirement is for 1 5 lakh engineers if the land bank we have is to be translated into construction
884353 other functions like residential and commercial real estate brokers real estate appraisers property mangers and real estate consultants would also be in demand
884354 an acute shortage of doctors is expected over the next few years especially anaesthetists radiologists gynaecologists and surgeons particularly neurosurgeons the need would be for 45 000 50 000 doctors for the 50 odd healthcare companies expected to start operations in india
884355 people with a masters in hospital administration mha will be in demand as they are key elements to a hospitals efficiency
884356 many big hospital projects have either been delayed or stopped because of this manpower shortage
884357 with the rule of thumb being four mha people per hospital around 2 000 hospital chains will need 8 000 such people over the next five years
884358 another area which would see a demand is pharma regulation and documentation officers
884359 a lot of portfolio managers not necessarily fund managers but those who manage portfolios beyond a certain amount will be required they will be working with banks and financial institutions the requirement will be for 25 000 30 000 every year
884360 over 50 000 new jobs are expected to be created in the banking financial services and insurance sector in the current year banks are expected to hire 15 000 20 000 people in the next one year
884361 over 2 5 lakh rooms will be needed in the next five years to meet the demand from both the domestic and international guests over the next two or three years we will need over 1 lakh more rooms an average of 1 5 service personnel per room will mean an overall shortage of at least 1 5 lakh people across a whole range of hotel related jobs in india especially food production food and beverage services housekeeping and front office operations
884362 technical maintenance people need to understand aspects such as provision of adequate power supply safety issues water supply sanitation signages and so on for soft services hospitality management experience is preferred
884363 apart from recruitment specialists another area of demand in the hr space will be employer brand specialists as organisations move away from a me too approach and actively seeking differentiation
884364 about 4 000 5 000 people will be directly employed by tv channels every year
884365 in radio the demand would be for production people anchors technical and distribution sales professionals jobs for 2 500 people in the next two years
884366 despite stagnation in the industry a lot of project based or contractual hiring and increasing domestic it requirements would lead to organic growth
884367 professionals who have a holistic knowledge and can do multitasking like coding testing designing and communicating with clients will be in demand
884368 india will need 4 9 lakh professionals in the it exports market 11 1 lakh in the domestic it industry and 20 5 lakh in the ites bpo sector by 2012
884369 about 1 5 lakh trained people every year would be needed

884371 jobs in demand would be telecom mechanical software and telecom test engineers project managers network security specialists and operation managers

884373 first we take a look backward and try to discover where we have been at fault next we make a vigorous attempt to repair the damage we have done and third having thus cleaned away the debris of the past we consider how with our newfound knowledge of ourselves we may develop the best possible relations with every human being we know

885065 i grew up on the east coast and ive driven through vermont in both winter and summer
885066 im surprised no one else has done it in aos expansions
885067 vt is super expensive especially in the winter turns when it could cost 15 for a basic three tile build
885068 because of the expensive builds pretty much everyone is going for the money
885069 its not uncommon to see everyone pass on urb or loco and instead go for cash based actions
885070 new hampshire has the coolest state motto ever live free or die
885071 well at least until bruce willis kind of mucked with it anyway originally the thought was around that motto and the idea that having fewer rules for an aos game could be interesting you know freedom to do what you want and all that
885072 as i looked at the different rules to figure out what you could take out i noticed that there were some rules that said things you could specifically do such as deliver over other peoples track or build the same track essentially as any other player so nh resulted from simply saying no you cant to those two items which made a whole new set of challenges for the map so now the map emphasizes the die part of the motto which is closer to the ruthless spirit of aos anyway
885073 if the competition was only cutthroat that would be nice
885074 the reality is much harsher first build has huge value for the first few turns and jockeying for turn order continues within the regional track builders the whole game there are plenty of spaces to build but if you secure a first turn primo location you re probably going to have neighbors saying howdee within a turn if not right after you finish building for a double sized map there s all sorts of fighting on that first turn every single turn you need two actions in order to make any progress and of course there s only one available
885075 so there s no dupe builds no sharing track and oh yeah every other turn every tile costs 1 extra to build and you have to deliver from one state to the other which seems nice until you factor in little things like cubes can t go across cities of their own color and traditional loop building doesn t really work anymore

885077 two more networks will be announced later and uganda will be in both of them
885078 before they can study in uk foreign students must be sponsored by a ukba licensed education institution prove that they have means to support themselves and their families while studying here and supply their fingerprints stricter rules on work placements for students will also ensure that the uks labour market is protected
885079 all those who come to britain must play by the rules it is right that foreign students wanting to take advantage of our world class universities and colleges must meet strict criteria
885080 by locking people to one identity with id cards alongside a tough new sponsorship system we will know exactly who is coming here to study and crack down on bogus colleges
885081 i welcome the education sectors involvement in developing a structure that allows international students to benefit from the excellent educational experience the uk offers while giving them the opportunity to work in the uk for two years following graduation
885082 however i will not tolerate the minority of individuals who seek to damage the quality of our education system through bogus colleges this is why we have introduced tighter checks to the current register of education and training providers the new system will toughen this process further and give extra protection from the damage bogus colleges can cause
885083 these are the schools i went through and now i get to work in them so its fantastic
885084 miss gladstone has enthusiastically embraced the idea of racial diversity as a teacher a softball coach for rich east and as an active member of the community her service has helped make park forest a better place to live
885085 she was principal highland preschool in chicago heights and she served in many other capacities in that school district
885086 her caring and wanting to be there to help people
885087 her service to the community has helped improve intergroup relationships in the south suburban area her unselfish commitment to bridging the gap between racial economic and cultural differences is demonstrated by her active work with not only students in school district 170 but with families as well

885092 no mapping between account names and security ids was done
885093 its pretty close its been that way since playing together in high school
885094 i just scrap my way on and rick hits moonshots and scores me
885095 they are all good buddies and baseball is the one thing that brought them together over the years its brought their families together and it shows
885096 talent takes you so far and at some point tangibles start to play a role
885097 he does pretty much everything right he knows what to do in every situation he gets on base more than anyone ive ever played with he never strikes out in the field hes by far the best shortstop ive ever played with or against hes just a great all around player
885098 he can play defense he has a strong arm he can run the bases well and he can hit the ball a long way
885099 they are both going to end up having fine careers there
885100 by going to fitchburg it allowed them to play right away and unless you are a pro prospect thats what you want to do if you are going to be there for four years you want to play for four years theyre going to be able to play for four years and hopefully put fitchburg on the map
885101 this year is our last year and i definitely think this team can make a run at the state title
885102 we have enough pitching we have a very good lineup and the defense has been great all year
885103 old vs new or good vs evil or communication vs pollution etc
885104 you only have a certain amount of time to do things in life
885105 the world is in crisis and human beings only respond to crisis
885106 it showed me how human beings could live in unison with nature and not control or manipulate it
885107 we find that there is a shortage of teachers in rural schools especially in high schools because people prefer to work in the cities
885108 student teachers who are at third year level at tertiary institutions should spend their fourth year of study at schools under supervision of their lecturers as part of internships
885109 we want people with ba degrees majoring in history travel and tourism to be adopted as temporary teachers they should be allowed to teach because they are subject specialists
885110 the department failed to look at the demand for teachers as a result of the curriculum and we want to address the issue
885111 green flag focuses on hiking and canoe trails we check if the trail is responsibly and honestly managed how efficiently it is run and if it is environmentally responsible
885112 if aspirant trailists know that these key things have been checked then they know what to expect especially with 2010 on the horizon and the likely influx of loads of novice trailists this is very important
885113 he educates his visitors on what birds and fish to look out for and his enthusiasm has motivated us to go even harder on what we are trying to do nukakamma is not a wilderness experience but it is a pure nature experience for folk who just need to get into the outdoors
885114 as a matter of curiousity are the polls open to members only or to everybody
885115 the mother left the child with friends on friday at some point in day the woman taking care of the girl also left leaving her with a 17 year old boy
885116 community members noticed after finding the child that she was very dirty and bleeding they took her to the police station and a case of rape was opened police then took her to uitenhage provincial hospital for treatment
885117 besides the hotels and bed and breakfast facilities in the metro there are other informal accommodation facilities we work very closely with a number of stakeholders involved with accommodation
885118 the association alone has 120 members who are only about a quarter of the bed and breakfast owners in port elizabeth i think there are more than 15000 beds in the metro people should not think there is an accommodation crisis and spend money on building bed and breakfasts for 2010
885119 we are heavily promoting private home stays where tourists live with local families and have the opportunity to learn about the culture of the area through direct interaction with locals for a more personal experience
885120 acsa airports company sa is looking at upgrading the airport the government has injected r21 billion into the development and upgrading of a number of airports in the country among them the port elizabeth airport
885121 this structure would need to be carefully integrated into the lower donkin reserve tidying up what has forever been an ugly messy cliff face along chapel street but without forming a monotonous wall along the length of the street
885122 historically the donkin reserve is one of the more important icons of nelson mandela bay because it is where the metropolitan area had its beginnings on the coast
885123 the donkin reserve is in dire need of refurbishment so that its appeal as a place to visit and enjoy is enhanced

885208 indeed i have consistently opposed calls for legislation or rules to impose network neutrality

885212 to reformed baptist families i recommend gill first and foremost before calvin and before henry the reason is simple the commentary is comprehensive virtually covering every verse in the bible and the doctrines of graces are accurately riddled throughout for the benefit of you and your children if you have been wanting a comprehensive commentary on scripture but have been baffled dont fully know what is good and what is bad you will not go wrong with gill to those who are avid readers and collectors of good books like myself if you dont own gill or fallaciously consider him to be below your level a waste of money or surpassed by modern commentaries how wrong you are originally i made the mistake of taking gill for granted but i tell you a man of many books there is so much theology in the commentaries of gill one would do well to get half of it in a life time deep theological veins run there take another look consult him on a verse and tell me you found nothing there perhaps my early neglect of gill was due to the fact that i didnt really know how to look and that is why i could get nothing or see nothing in gill or maybe i didnt look because i didnt take gill serious but whatever the reason it matters not so much has changed now he is one of my favorite commentators and his set my most valued comprehensive set on the bible to be without him is to remain ignorant recommended chief among commentaries

885215 the report which purports to be a result of six months investigation is but a hotch potch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
885216 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain that president thabo mbeki received a bribe of r30 million from man ferrostaal
885217 the presidency would like to place it on record that president mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
885218 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should approach the law enforcement agencies
885219 if the president facilitated a r2 million bribe for jacob zuma and r28 million for the anc it would show that the anc is rotten to the core
885220 president mbeki must now explain himself to the nation in a televised address without delay we have the right to hear his side of the story
885221 he has the right to tell his side of the story but we want the whole truth and nothing but the truth
885222 the president must appoint a judicial commission of inquiry to fully investigate every aspect of the arms deal
885223 it is high time all the allegations in the de lille dossier were investigated by an independent judicial commission of inquiry that can lead to the prosecution of all those implicated in the arms deal
885224 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
885225 the irregularities and improprieties referred to in our report point to the conduct of certain officials of the government departments involved and cannot in our view be attributed to the president or the ministers involved in their capacity as members of the cabinet
885226 in other words what is meant to be a six month investigation by the sunday times turns out to be peddling of information among competing companies including in its own words a number of arms dealers who were involved in bidding for the south african contracts
885227 grotesque allegation that zuma acted as mbekis front man during the arms deal negotiations particularly in the context of the court process currently under way

885238 this tool sheds light on the importance of strong public policy that helps save lives in states across the nation
885239 when you can visually see how many lives can be saved it really changes how the public and policy makers see our roads
885240 we must take aggressive action to reduce needless deaths on our nations roadways and saferoadmaps org will give citizens and policymakers the information they need to improve travel safety
885241 i applaud the center for excellence in rural safety for their leadership in developing tools that can help us all in our quest to improve the safety of our nations roadways
885242 by mapping out these fatalities we can visually see what a large problem we have in our country

885244 we have all worked extremely hard to meet our commitment to commence production of the mg tf in august
885245 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
885246 we have taken the very best options from the car that you saw before and put them into one package
885247 if you look at the pre orders that we have had through our dealers about 70 percent are already sold and that tells its own story

885250 i believe the agreement is good for india and good for the world
885251 will welcome india into the non proliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
885252 will be to proceed to the nuclear suppliers group nsg where we hope to move quickly on revising the guidelines that will enable civil nuclear cooperation with india before submitting the agreement for congressional approval later this year
885253 we are of course approaching all friendly countries but we do hope that the nsg will similarly grant a clean unconditional exemption for india
885254 the deal is certainly important for india but its also important for the world at large because i think it meets the twin objectives of energy security as well as global climate change related issues and concerns
885255 france has long supported the development of civil nuclear cooperation with india
885256 and the concrete result of that i hope will be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test them at any time in the future
885257 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions
885258 this is an accord for the long term for 30 or 40 years
885259 given the worlds reliance on coal we need to find ways to make it a cleaner energy source were delighted to be working with our partners in china to help find solutions to this global challenge
885260 in a recent visit to china prime minister kevin rudd said that china was the largest consumer of coal in the world and australia was the worlds largest exporter of coal as such australia and china should work together develop low emissions coal technologies
885261 it will allow pcc technology to be progressed in the chinese energy sector which will have a much greater impact than operating in australia alone
885262 the next steps in the research would be moving to a much larger demonstration phase before then progressing to a full scale system
885263 the united states currently generates less than 1 of its electricity through clean abundant solar energy
885264 according to a recent special report by scientific american a combination of photovoltaic solar farms and concentrated solar collectors could supply up to 69 of the daily electricity needs of the united states by 2050
885265 major utilities like southern california edison and pg and e have been signing up for huge solar installations in the hundreds of megawatts duke energy has proposed to install 20 megawatts of solar distributed generation capacity at a cost of 100 million
885266 while the federal regulatory environment for solar is far from ideal dukes decision to invest in solar is aided by north carolinas renewable portfolio standard a similar mechanism is what has driven california to be a leading light in the domestic solar power push and is also the key reason why companies like first solar sunpower and trina solar have taken a shine to the u s market
885267 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
885268 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
885269 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
885270 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
885271 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
885272 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
885273 since i plan to speak with prime minister singh president hu jintao and already did so with bush we will see if it is possible to return to the negotiating table
885274 it might take a month or two but an agreement is necessary because we need to guarantee for the poorest countries access to the market of the most developed ones
885275 close to reaching an agreement and it did not happen because of minor issues
885276 dupont solamet metallization materials developed by our world class research team have set the pv industry standard for many years by enabling customers to reduce costs increase efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of their products

885278 at home i am the person who is always shutting off the lights trying to save energy
885279 getting involved in this project will help me and the university do this on a bigger scale
885280 the campus wants to know how warm and humid it is so they can open or close dampers that take in outside air a free commodity to cool buildings
885281 there are many applications where detailed weather information can be very useful
885282 uc san diego is a leader when it comes to research in areas like global warming climate change and even energy management
885283 we have a great opportunity on this campus to become a laboratory for those technologies to put into practice what were studying
885284 another important aspect of this project is that we are bringing science engineering and policy together
885285 a priority for esi is that people making policy decisions about our environment be informed our weather data are invaluable in this context
885286 this important energy management project at ucsd will help to protect our environment save energy resources and save costs to consumers
885287 right now we have five weather stations in operation and were trying to cover the whole range from the ocean to east campus
885288 we will have a very dense network of up to 30 stations on a campus whereas you usually have one or two stations in an entire city weather stations are not new but the density of the stations is
885289 were also in contact with businesses and corporations in san diego who are interested in reducing their costs being more environmentally friendly and possibly adding solar power panels to their rooftops
885290 uncertainties and destabilising factors in the international environment are increasing
885291 we have made clear that our priorities are to maintain steady and fast economic growth on the one hand and control excessively growing prices on the other
885292 its true that in preparing for the games the economic and social development of beijing has been greatly boosted
885293 on the other hand beijings economic aggregate merely accounts for a small portion of the national total we should not overestimate the boost that the beijing games will have on the national economy
885294 we want to earnestly protect the national environment and make conscientious efforts to conserve energy and control pollution
885295 we want to strengthen our efforts to reform the administrative system to further enhance efficiency of state organs and improve the state and government services in order to protest the rights and interest of the people

885323 we got a call from an ngo offering to place the baby elsewhere but how can we hum apna dukh doosro ke saath kaise baate how can we share our sadness with someone else even if they have the money to look after the baby the child will always be compared with other normal children
885324 what if the surgery fails it could get septic the child will have a tough life as it is life in mumbai is such a struggle and so fast the child would be at a disadvantage right from the start how can the child travel by train we have thought it over a lot in the past few weeks how can a mother and father watch their own child die whether it is with us or anyone else thats why we said no to the ngo
885325 in any case according to medical experts it is only after 20 weeks that a serious anomaly can be detected in a fetus through a sonography let people join in and take the fight forward
885326 the comparisons to 2004 were inevitable when the red sox finally parted ways at the nonwaivers trading deadline with a disgruntled superstar and retooled with two months remaining
885327 four years ago the jettisoning of nomar garciaparra in a four team blockbuster deal shook the sox from the malaise of a lackluster july and jump started them for a 42 18 finish and the eventual end of 86 years of frustration thursdays three team deal that sent manny ramirez to los angeles and brought in jason bay from pittsburgh involved fewer teams and players but is beginning to have the same effect
885328 i think the opening partnerships in both the innings was a turning point of the match sehwag getting a double hundred and giving fantastic starts with gautam gambhir was very important
885329 he sehwag is a very good player and the way he scored runs in both the innings was great getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing
885330 it was also amazing the way harbhajan singh bowled in both the innings and then ishant and zaheer khan today
885331 it was something special from the 19 year old sharma everybody saw what he is capable of it augurs really well going into the last test
885332 i was never worried you cannot say 300 350 is enough but on this wicket if you have 300 and the way our new ball bowlers bowled was amazing
885333 getting three wickets for 10 runs within 40 minutes was crucial and that put sri lanka on the backfoot
885334 i am really proud of the way we played in this test we are confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
885335 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners they are quality spinners mendis is a mystery to some of us but sehwag has shown that you can get runs against the spinners
885336 it was important to get a good start when you are chasing any total which we did not get losing three wickets for 10 runs was not ideal and thats where we probably lost the game
885337 we had a plan but when you lose three quick wickets it is very difficult to fight back our batting was not consistent enough i thought we could give them a better fight
885338 i am very happy for ajantha he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well but it is very disappointing to lose the game in which he has taken 10 wickets
885339 the bowling unit fought really well throughout the test and created opportunities for us
885340 it has been by personal experience too if we devote much time and effort to architecture design clarifying requirements attention to detail etc the outcoming product feature is usually pretty good with very few bugs
885341 could we have improved out testing methodology so that we caught that one before the egg hit our faces
885342 it took us a considerable amount of time to go in and reconstruct the events
885343 there was a couple of processes that were in contention for a common data structure and through a software coding error in one of the application processes they were both able to get write access to a data structure at the same time
885344 and that corruption lead to the alarm event application getting into an infinite loop and spinning
885345 we test exhaustively we test with third parties and we had in excess of three million online operational hours in which nothing had ever exercised that bug
885346 im not sure that more testing would have revealed that unfortunately thats kind of the nature of software you may never find the problem i dont think thats unique to control systems or any particular vendor software
885347 my main research interests continue to involve security crypto applications overall system survivability reliability fault tolerance safety software engineering methodology systems in the large applications of formal methods and risk avoidance
885348 we keep having these things happen again and again and were not learning from our mistakes
885349 there are many possible problems that can cause massive failures but they require a certain discipline in the development of software and in its operation and administration that we dont seem to find
885350 whether its a race condition or a bug in a recovery process as in the at amp t case theres this idea that you can build things that need to be totally robust without really thinking through the design and implementation and all of the things that might go wrong
885351 this belief that testing can create quality software systems is a fundamental problem in the software industry we dont think of the whole process of building and deploying software in a way that would prevent errors because we dont believe that it can actually be done yet this error prevention approach is not only possible but necessary every mature industry has a already figured this out and stopped relying on testing as a way to make products work we continue to have faith that testing will deliver quality but it never does
885352 beware of premature optimization and dont optimize until you know where the bottleneck s are

885579 tutte le persone hanno due facce quella sorridente di quando va tutto bene e quella triste quando si diventa anche cattivi io preferisco il lato buono tante volte sono incavolato ma tengo questo stato danimo per me preferisco sorridere quando sto con gli altri non vuol dire che sono falso solo che non voglio far pesare sugli altri i miei problemi adesso sono col brasile e affronto lolimpiade sono qui per dare una mano agli amici a tentare unimpresa storica per i brasiliani che non hanno mai vinto loro olimpico e per farlo bisogna essere felici
885580 e stata unesperienza orribile per me e per la squadra prima del mondiale ero considerato quasi come pel dopo leliminazione ho sentito solo critiche che non avevo voglia di giocare che me nero andato a una festa dopo la partita nessuno che sia venuto a chiedermi come ti senti avrei risposto che ero triste che mi dispiaceva per quella sconfitta per non essere riuscito a dare alla mia nazione quello che avrei voluto invece sentii solo critiche che mi resero infelice ma ho imparato tantissimo
885581 e stato il periodo peggiore della mia vita ero infortunato non potevo allenarmi non potevo giocare lunica cosa che potevo fare era guardare la tv e pi guardavo le partite seduto su una poltrona pi diventavo triste non era mai successo che stessi fermo per cos tanto tempo non sapevo che fare per rimediare
885582 la mia famiglia mi ha protetto mi ha dato forza e ha anche sofferto perch le cattiverie non si sono fermate a me ma hanno coinvolto anche mio fratello roberto che anche mio agente lo hanno accusato di creare instabilit di stare vicino a me solo per i soldi e tante altre invenzioni con lunico scopo di farmi male ma siamo andati avanti io e la mia famiglia uno al fianco dellaltro
885583 quello che non capisco come sia possibile che fino a un certo giorno ero un esempio per tutti e che subito dopo ero diventato come maradona quando era al centro delle polemiche quando sono in vacanza faccio quello che voglio durante la stagione mi comporto da professionista serio non sgarro mai poi quando il campionato finito sono libero si tratta di momenti diversi non si possono mischiare le cose devi vivere bene sentirti felice se vuoi essere anche un buon atleta io faccio il massimo per essere un buon giocatore ma quando limpegno si concluso mi godo la vita
885584 per arrivare a questi livelli e ancor di pi per rimanerci ho dovuto sacrificare tante cose nella mia vita e ancora devo impegnarmi al massimo per essere allaltezza

885687 the fact that hes related to ralph wasnt the primary reason for choosing him it was an advantage that he looked very similar to ralph of course that was useful but primarily i went for hero because of this wonderful haunted quality that seemed to bring tom riddle alive on screen for us

885701 secara teknis setiap jaringan operator di dunia memiliki kemampuan untuk melakukan pemblokiran ponsel melalui bantuan nomor imei namun hal tersebut tidak disarankan di indonesia karena proses registrasi atau keabsahan kepemilikan ponsel yang masih diragukan solusi seperti itu diprediksi dapat disalahgunakan oleh setiap pengguna seluler untuk memblokir ponsel orang lain
885702 di luar negeri ada pelanggan dengan sistem kontrak atau disebut juga dengan nama subsidi subscriber mereka biasanya adalah pelanggan pascabayar setiap mereka membeli perangkat yang sudah terintegrasi dengan nomor telepon sudah pasti operator mendapatkan data kepemilikan perangkat tersebut dengan jelas perangkat dengan nomor imei sekian memiliki nomor msisdn sim card sekian dengan nama pelanggan a dan bertempat tinggal dengan alamat yang jelas
885703 kejelasan data seperti itulah yang tidak dimiliki oleh pelanggan seluler di indonesia sehingga tidak ada keharusan bagi operator untuk melakukan proses pemblokiran meskipun alasannya pencurian ponsel

885719 i think this is a wonderful thing for the hilltops region which continues to be awarded time and again theres a great future for hilltops wines we are truly blessed with the climate altitude and soil if we even get a half kind season we will end up with a great grape
885720 if the temperature was any warmer the grapes would ripen too quickly and if it was any cooler they wouldnt ripen to their full potential
885721 the reds are consistently very good the riesling is exceptionally good in a cooler year and all wines are of excellent quality with refined aromas and flavours
885722 i told him it is not in our charter southern cross care is an organization that under its constitution cares for old people and we have no other charter
885723 my view is that pensioner renters are just as worthy for quality accommodation as people who can afford to pay
885724 after all young gave the whole of the retirement village and land to southern cross care at no cost
885725 now i think something should be given back to the community for the benefit of all

885729 you dont need to be a genius to know that 2008 is the crunch year for many producers
885730 with the current season still hanging in the balance regarding rain and sub soil moisture farmers certainly want to make sure that costly actions such as spraying are done at the most effective times for control
885731 comprehensive field trials have shown that stripe rust at this early stage of plant growth has no impact on yield so spraying now will only have an aesthetic impact on the crop
885732 these same trials have shown that spraying at specific stages as the plants grow is most effective namely when the first node becomes visible referred to as growth stage 31 and then as the flag leaf emerges which is growth stage 39
885733 the sprays we have are not curative but preventative providing protection to the plant for around three to four weeks so the timing of spraying is critical
885734 stripe rust is not a systemic disease as it only effects the section of the leaf where the spores land therefore we need only protect the leaves that contribute most to the crops yield
885735 at present we are seeing quite widespread signs of rust in some crops like early season grazing wheats and triticale
885736 varieties like ventura with moderate resistance are showing rust symptoms but others with higher resistance levels like gregory are remaining clean for the moment
885737 this season is also showing the benefits of appropriate fungicide seed treatments prior to sowing with crops planted with treated seed showing no sign or at very worst insignificant symptoms of stripe rust at this stage
885738 it is however looking like rust will be quite prevalent throughout the region and as there could be chemical shortages as the season progresses timely spraying will be critical
885739 most management methods are based on the conventional view which in fact only causes some types of splitting
885740 water applied directly to the fruit surface and excluded from the soil did result in an increase in smaller concentric apical and stem end splits but had no effect on longitudinal splits
885741 the results were quite conclusive showing that root system water uptake is a significant factor in fruit splitting
885742 this is going to have a huge impact on management methods allowing orchardists to better make decisions on picking timing and fruit treatments based on rainfall and weather forecasts
885743 it was found that skin tensile strength was a major varietal determinant of splitting levels
885744 within varieties there was also a significant impact of crop load on overall splitting which has important consequences itself on management planning and decisions

885747 wgag are intent on using awb as an agri political platform rather than allowing them to compete on an equal footing with bulk handling companies and international traders
885748 if awb remains the only company on the australian stock exchange with an out dated and costly dual shareholding structure it will fall behind and be unable to offer australian wheat growers competitive prices and services in the new deregulated wheat export marketing environment

885848 do people choose the art that inspires them do they think it over decide they might prefer the fabulous to the real for me it was those early readings of fairy tales that made me who i was as a reader and later on as a storyteller
885849 current cant equates fantasy with escapism and current fashion would have it that fantasy is both easy to read and to write it isnt when it is done honestly by a skillful writer fantasy takes us far enough beyond our daily perceptions to open us to the essential realities beneath it this is the true goal of all art
885850 our lives are stories and the stories we have to give to each other are the most important no one has a story too small and all are of equal stature we each tell them in different ways through different mediums and if we care about each other well take the time to listen
885851 as our storytellers continue to draw upon past knowledge including looking to the animal world and to tribal storytellers for guidance we grow in strength we reshape our ancestors stories for our children so that these tales will like our people our spirits endure
885852 when we change the shape of the land we alter the contents and contexts of our collective familial and personal memories yet stories can preserve both mythic and familiar elements of geography even when the physical features are forgotten buried or obliterated and more than this the stories can bring these elements back if the land can be preserved long enough for its stories to be told and retold perhaps we all as custodians of both place and memory stand a chance at real preservation
885853 vision is one of the five senses a gift thats easy to take for granted it comes to us so easily we simply open our eyes and see and yet there are levels of seeing as fairy tales tell us when we constrict or confuse our vision we are primed for betrayal and destruction we are in the hold of the witch to free ourselves we must both try to see clearly and allow ourselves to be seen these are acts of courage and of power if we can go beyond that and see compassionately we may even partake in acts of grace
885854 i grew up in a milieu of carribean writers and writing i bring that sensibility to my own work but i write within a particularly northern tradition of speculative and fantastical fiction there plot and content are equally important and the speculative or fantastical elements of the story must be real duppies and jumbies elements of folklore must exist outside the imaginations of the characters any scientific extrapolation should seem convincingly based in the possible its an approach designed to ease or force the suspension of disbelief to block flight back into the familiar world to shake up the reader into thinking in new tracks
885855 folklore is the perfect second skin from under its hide we can see all the shimmering shadowy uncertainties of the world
885856 at its best fantasy rewards the reader with a sense of wonder about what lies within the heart of the commonplace world the greatest tales are told over and over in many ways through centuries fantasy changes with the changing times and yet it is still the oldest kind of tale in the world for it began once upon a time and we havent heard the end of it yet
885857 stories ive been telling stories for years with paint with words with film and video cameras and pixels on computer screens yet what do i know nothing really i cant explain storytelling the way teachers explain math or history when i draw or write or envision a film i try to switch off and not think too much to explain what im doing when i create would be like waking up while still dreaming dreams we are all storytellers night after night for even the most inartistic of us can still dream like masters
885858 as artists brian and i are merely part of a long mythic tradition giving old faery tales new life and passing them on to the generations to come

886085 the clone wars movie at the end of the day has a lot of action
886086 the action sequences kind of tie it all together and the story moves through the big battle scenes its very fast paced i know the live action star wars movies are pretty fast paced but the prequels were kind of longer feeling than the old style movies theres more of a serialized feeling in empire strikes back the clone wars are a little bit more in that classic sensibility where the story moves quickly its faster paced and the characters kind of develop on the go

886126 i have a trick for pasta i actually eat it a lot and its usually one of my go to dinners when i am trying to lose weight ahem like lately like since i gained 6 pounds in one month okay so make the pasta obviously the lighter one is better but i dont count carbs so i eat whatever pasta i want try to score pasta sauce with less than 50 60 calories per half cup then instead of using the straight pasta sauce add in a whole can of diced tomatoes whether italian or no seasoning those have like 80 calories per can it makes the pasta seem so healthy and full of tomato flavor and adds bulk to your meal sprinkle with a little low fat i like the 2 kraft mozzarella and i mean sprinkle maybe a pinch and youre done another suggestion is to add some steamed broccoli or broccollini anyway as a serial dieter i am always trying to add bulk to any meal because like everyone portion control is my problem
886127 mac and cheese has a great low cal recipe on the side of the box make it with light butter and fat free milk and its even better than the nutrition info would suggest i again add broccoli to it i like broccoli and it has a lot of fiber and iron

886251 if texas doesnt stop the execution texas is going to be responsible for putting the united states in breach of its international obligations
886252 this is an individual who along with five others brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two young teenage girls
886253 we dont care where youre from if you commit a despicable crime like this in texas youll face the ultimate penalty under our laws

886255 jose medellin is nothing more than a poster boy for the death penalty

886264 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
886265 its an ongoing problem that has flooded the city court city secretary and court clerk with paperwork
886266 if we moved there without checking first that would have been irresponsible
886267 i asked him why he was wearing the shirt with the word police on it and he said its a deterrent so people will think im a cop
886268 for a realtor and a builder during our economic times to want to give back says a lot about those folks
886269 they believe in the sanctity of each of the children that we treat at cook childrens
886270 its outstanding the guys just stepped it up another level to make it better than the homes that we build
886271 they all just went above and beyond what they usually do
886272 while i might not have followed district procedures i was upfront about what was going on
886273 was using petty cash as if it was an atm machine
886274 mr gast had requested i do something that was wrong
886275 all the assistants and myself are asked to do things that are not our jobs
886276 i believed this was not a problem because the 180 was a very small amount compared to the yearly amount put into the account
886277 however the district saw it differently and i was told this was a violation of the use of activity money
886278 his kids have been going to inappropriate sites on his laptop
886279 to use those two pictures as leverage against me keeping my job is unfair
886280 anytime something comes out that questions you its in everyones best interest to move on
886281 this has been a very trying experience for me and my family
886282 i want people to understand that the choice that the school board has is either to include a stadium or delay the elementary school
886283 you should always put the educational facilities first and it is needed for overcrowding
886284 it was necessary but it is not critical right now
886285 personally i would like to see both i believe in an effort to come to a figure we all felt that the bond was more likely to pass we had to make some cuts the choices that we faced arent easy ones

886289 hi im walter cronkite jr im here to inform america of its most secret deadly killer the sewing machine
886290 it has been 18 years since the americans with disabilities act passed theres so many places where people with disabilities still have problems
886291 theres some good stuff in there but some very negative things also
886292 i am very keen that there will be rules to ensure access for individuals with vision loss to all of the technology systems present and future that people use in their everyday lives
886293 things like cellphones atm machines computer systems anything where there is an on screen display should be designed in a manner that would permit its use by an individual with limited eyesight
886294 we believe any animal that can be trained to perform tasks directly relating to an individuals disability they are service animals
886295 there are still many places i go such as the movie theater downtown where there are difficulties the goal is to be inclusive
886296 my father and all his brothers they passed away due to the hiv epidemic
886297 the rate of aids diagnoses for black women was nearly 23 times the rate for white women
886298 the thing about african americans is they dont want to know
886299 they feel like if they dont know it aint going to hurt them and when they do find out they dont want to talk about it if we could just break the silence i think that we can prevent a lot of hiv and aids in the african american community
886300 people in situations are going to not have access to the information they need or the healthcare they need
886301 theyre doing things for survival that they might not do if they werent in such dire circumstances
886302 there was a time when a woman was expected to have sex with the master of the house and the masters son and her husband could do nothing for her
886303 that silence is historic and people not talking about what happens in terms of sexual relationships has been handed down through generations
886304 and you also have to remember theres clearly the continued racism thats still pervasive there was a recent study in the new england journal of medicine on implicit bias that takes place among physicians treating african american versus non african american patients in terms of the types of treatments that are provided
886305 my research team documented in the early 90s and published our results showing that the most conservative african americans we surveyed church congregations that 30 percent of them believed that hiv was a man made virus unleashed on the black community
886306 the fact that the theme resonates today is a serious problem and is contributing to the spread
886307 we have allowed our problems with addressing the issue of homosexuality to blind us to the results of what it means to have people closeted what it means to have men marry because the homophobia is so devastating therefore they engage in same sex behavior with men and come home to the woman
886308 theres a stigma attached to it so people dont come out and admit they have it a lot of people dont realize how real it is in their own neighborhoods
886309 at some earlier stages in this epidemic it was lack of a perceived risk
886310 they saw it as a white gay male disease so the behaviors that put people at risk unprotected sex and sharing needles with people who were infected didnt apply to them from their own perspective
886311 black leadership in the early days said we cannot own hiv aids because it will be used to denigrate us
886312 one fourth of the people living with hiv in the united states in one study have been incarcerated at some point
886313 a man who may have been in jail for a considerable time and then leaves that environment may move to heterosexual companionship but may move in a situation which the adequate support system in terms of education and treatment arent there in terms of hiv so its a complex situation with poverty racism and incarceration also becoming part of the paradigm in terms of hiv spread
886314 president bush has this wonderful program outside the u s but washington d c has infection rates higher than most of the places that pepfar dollars go
886315 but in the u s we dont have a national aids plan we dont have continuing growth of resources as the number of new infections and the number of people living longer with hiv grow in this country
886316 in the african american community you hear the statistics but you dont see the results
886317 when its happening at home really up close you cant see the forest for the trees people arent talking about it people arent broadcasting it making it a major issue
886318 now weve got some good churches out there who are rolling up their sleeves and fighting
886319 during the time period 2001 2004 hiv diagnosis rates among black males and females declined by 4 4 percent and 6 8 percent respectively
886320 results from a 2007 study reported similar declines among african americans in the state of florida
886321 its promising that were moving away from being disease specific aids over here heart disease over there and talking more broadly about health disparities and addressing the common risk factors
886322 and that means you must address the issue of poverty and health literacy
886323 if you take aids out the isolated box and put it in a broader context of other racial and ethnic health disparities cardiovascular disease diabetes infant mortality it destigmatizes it in some ways
886324 i go back and look at the kinds of things that happened in the civil rights movement
886325 it wasnt a well funded movement and people were under pressure but they understood what was happening and these were times they could thrive and find hope
886326 i don t have a problem arguing or holding my own though
886327 sin mejoras dramaticas lo mucho que se ha logrado estara perdido

886335 ive a little karting race organised on saturday which has become a tradition for the last five or six years but now it will be a very special event having won this race
886336 it will be nice to go and see my people there my family but then it will be back to business although i will even try to get something out of the break
886337 ill spend a bit of time in woking talking to the engineers and preparing for the next race european grand prix valencia
886338 this win doesnt turn my world completely upside down even if there was a two month break now
886339 im happy about it but this is just part of the goal i set myself because now the next goal is to repeat this and then after that to do it again
886340 we just need to keep up our concentration all the time
886341 of course i feel a little sorry for felipe and even for lewis because they both drove a great race
886342 but i know how they feel because ive had similar moments myself this year quite a few times
886343 after saturday ive been in a position to fight for the victory but something has always gone wrong something hasnt functioned perfectly
886344 so to stand on the top step of the podium and to hear the finnish anthem playing for me was fantastic it was a great moment

886363 the manager has brought in some good quality players this summer such as el hadji diouf and steed malbranque and me
886364 we need to take it game by game try to win our home matches and if we do that then we can take the club on to the next level
886365 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16
886366 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not phased by the big games the quality is there

886373 this is what im thinking i want to expand teds house
886374 cristiano ronaldo is a massive player and every young footballer would like to be compared to him
886375 id be delighted to achieve what he has achieved in the next three or four years im young and have room for improvement
886376 its hard to get into the team because the standard is so high and the manager is bringing players in not just from this country but from around the world
886377 when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
886378 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
886379 i became extremely friendly and fond of the police officers who protected me
886380 they were extremely scrupulous and would never behave so cruelly to me get drunk on duty or do anything else he has said
886381 at the end of my nine years of protection they even held a party for me
886382 he has not checked his facts i was never locked in a cupboard nor was i suicidal none of these things happened
886383 the first i heard about the book was three weeks ago when a senior police officer called to warn me it was coming out
886384 i am not in the business of suppressing books i just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue
886385 whenever i write something i always want to make sure that what i write is defensible that doesnt seem to be the case here
886386 this is not just my reputation at stake apart from making me look bad hes made the entire police force look bad
886387 i am taking the action because i feel loyal towards those people who risked their lives for me
886388 they are being accused of all sorts of things and yet no one seems to be defending them
886389 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book
886390 there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
886391 i have highlighted rushdies comment on polices image above because i can see the double standards at work here as well
886392 given the decline in newspaper valuations since the acquisition it appears news corp could have gotten it a lot cheaper what was the rush
886393 any time in the first team is good experience for me when you go to places like villarreal and get to play half a game thats only going to help me improve and im enjoying it at the moment
886394 its all about picking up experience and getting minutes on the pitch and hopefully i will be given a few more chances
886395 the players around me are helping me because you have to pick up when youre playing with them
886396 if youre playing with xabi alonso stevie g or damien plessis or whoever you know you have to raise your game and hopefully im doing that and showing the boss what i can do
886397 competition for places is part of the game and its going to be the same if youre at any of the big four clubs so like i said i just have to step up my game and hopefully prove to the boss that im at least as good as any of the players hes bringing in
886398 im wary of glass because i am always out with children doing active stuff the effort involved in n
886399 hi mrs green just like with the recent polythene issue reusing cd dvds is another way to reduce la
886400 hi mrs green my diet is simpler as all food types are locally available vegetarian choices are not
886401 does anyone grow and use their own herbs for herbal infusions little miss green loves to choose her
886402 d thatd comprehensive thank you it brings me back to my original dilemma as well about the vege
886403 defending is a big part of my game so i was just doing my job
886404 obviously the role of a right back has changed now and defenders have to get forward more than they used to so thats something ive got to incorporate into my game
886405 its hard to get into the team because the standard is so high and the manager is bringing players in not just from this country but from around the world that makes the competition tougher but im enjoying getting games during pre season and hopefully ive shown the manager what i can do
886406 im really enjoying pre season i went away to the training camp in switzerland and it was just a great experience to be around all the first team players
886407 everyone has been really good to me helping me settle in and get used to being around the first team squad
886408 ngog showed his quality and i always say the same our scout department is working really hard to find young players at a good price hopefully it will be the first of many goals
886409 we showed from the start that we wanted to impress and win against a good team
886410 both teams worked hard in the first half but we had good possession and played with a high tempo we scored one and though we had some problems towards the end we controlled the first half
886411 the second half was more open so it was easier for us to move the ball and pass it
886412 both players showed really good movement but the understanding was also good between them and steven gerrard as well as yossi benayoun and dirk kuyt cutting inside
886413 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
886414 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
886415 we are going to be in this for the long haul
886416 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
886417 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
886418 were very concerned that a lot of people it would appear have been taken in by a very professional scam and theres a lot of money that appears to have gone under
886419 well collect as much information as possible for the accc the australian competition and consumer commission as well as international law enforcement agencies
886420 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate find substitute tickets or whatever
886421 political commentators believe barack obama is more popular with web surfers because his followers are younger and young people are more likely to use blogs social networks and other new media
886422 the risk of this process going off the rails is quite significant and if there is a significant delay in disablement it will mean that the third and the crucial phase of this process dismantlement of north koreas capabilities will be deferred even more and unlikely even to be discussed in the remainder of the bush administration
886423 shell go to refugee camps shell meet with dissidents shell meet with ethnic minority ngos the karen and the shan and others shell meet with the aid workers president bush will get a briefing on the cyclone he will probably meet with some burmese exile leaders in bangkok thats all important but its tricky
886424 the first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency the second is war both bring a temporary prosperity both bring a permanent ruin but both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists

886426 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
886427 are there actually vehicles that can travel into the future
886428 you know the thing about the future is every single minute is the future compared to the minute before so right now is the future compared to this morning and tomorrow morning is the future as we sit here now so you could say that this car is driving into the future this very moment

886695 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
886696 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
886697 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
886698 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning

886700 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
886701 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
886702 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
886703 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
886704 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
886705 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
886706 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
886707 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
886708 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
886709 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
886710 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
886711 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

886735 then people from base camp saw this lone figure in an orange suit coming down the mountain on sunday
886736 even though mark is the australian in the team this is historically the biggest story to come out of this
886737 its a pretty amazing story hes a very lucky guy he was way up at c4 when all this happened
886738 c4 is the highest camp on the mountain so its well in the so called death zone
886739 theres no doubt that those chair sniffing and bra snapping issues have made it difficult for us to obtain the clear air that we need
886740 it polling didnt show i was unelectable i resigned on a simple application of a principle that principle is what is the best interests of the liberal party
886741 theres a window of political opportunity in this state that has been opened its my view we would be better served by an alternate leader to take advantage
886742 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
886743 troy has worked hard as leader in difficult circumstances and has put the liberal party in a strong position to contest the state election
886744 ive been saying mr buswell was unelectable and thats been proved correct
886745 the emperor had a lovely set of clothes for about three months
886746 he said he would think about it but wanted to do it bloodlessly its looking like that will happen now
886747 i think it will regenerate the party we had no show with mr buswell as leader its still going to be very difficult but we will have a fighting chance
886748 ive enjoyed it and ill continue to work on the issues until the day i leave but im leaving
886749 people are switching off politics which i think is a very unfortunate situation it certainly makes it tough for troy to compete against alan carpenter
886750 its clearly a move for the moment rather than a move of where the partys going to be or will be in the future
886751 its a surprise in the sense that he seemed to be hanging on and it looked as though thats what he was going to do and also that the alternative is so unusual and fraught
886752 i mean you are going to bring back someone who said they are going to retire and in the process youre going to upset the endorsement of one of your star new recruits which is presumably what they are going to have to do
886753 its also very much a papering over the cracks move because presumably in the long term theyve got to find someone else

886781 after all i heard a lot of kunoichi lose their virginity around this time of year if they havent already
886782 no i never even had the chance to get his number
886783 i had a great night myself i was surprised that hachiro was such a good guy
886784 are you sure he wasnt after your body are you sure that you werent after his wallet
886785 well maybe that was our intentions to begin with but i have to admit we have chemistry
886786 you never answered my question why didnt you get his number
886787 from the looks of things the flirty feelings was mutual did you mess things up again
886788 he practically dragged me off when i came back hiromi was gone
886789 shut it ino pig he was really nice im disappointed that i couldnt talk to him longer
886790 so why did kakashi pull you away he catch you underage
886791 he was disappointed that i was out having a good time like im supposed to be at home crying under my covers
886792 i wish asuma sensei was still around to joke about that with me
886793 but hed probably encourage it or even expect it he was always so lax with us
886794 she slapped her hand against the table calling the attention of the people around her
886795 he was there and just happened to overhear i was in the nurses station he was already suspicious so i told him
886796 i just wish we didnt have to do this at all
886797 like just avoid it but its impossible if you do you get in trouble big trouble it seems
886798 youre right i hate the idea all the same but at least we have ikebana and dance my specialties
886799 i just wish i could avoid the sex ed classes maybe find an alternative
886800 i dont want to take part in the lectures or in the final exam
886801 i dont want them checking to see if i lost my virginity or not i mean i heard its only a jutsu but if you put up a counter blocker theyll bring in a nurse and everything and from that point theyll choose who you get to lose your virginity too
886802 i heard some girl fooled them but did it really
886803 the girl went out and lost her virginity right away either that or she improved the jutsu they didnt check her with a nurse the second time since they also put her under a lie jutsu
886804 she was weak willed apparently she even spoke his name
886805 she was threatened with expulsion as a ninja i dont think shed lie tsunade stepped in which is probably why they backed off
886806 its a shame we cant just have a shadow clone or something
886807 brilliant nothing about that is brilliant sakura they must test for that anko may be a bit crazy but she isnt stupid nor are the observers
886808 which is why ill show up to my other classes real and sometimes to the sex ed classes as myself too
886809 were off duty maybe it will work but what if it doesnt
886810 its fine i dont want to follow you down your road of ruin
886811 i want it but i dont want it given to me
886812 youd rather steal it you dont believe in an honest day of work
886813 you ninja are all the same thing murderers mercenaries worse things than me
886814 misguided im just unlucky no one hires a kid my age not even here
886815 i may be a thief but im not a murderer
886816 what makes you think i am a murderer im a med nin i save lives
886817 if you were told to youd kill someone youd kill an enemy a villager even your own friend ninja are scum because they do what theyre told they are no better the enemy they dont even think that what they do is wrong
886818 see i told you so youre as hopeless as i am
886819 then yesterday you were off flirting with a random stranger now your beating up little kids
886820 im still mad at you kakashi sensei he was gone when i went back i didnt even get his number
886821 you shouldnt of given that kid the money i imagine after madokas you dont have much left you wouldnt really want to do a d class mission to pay your next bill would you
886822 im fine i can work another shift at the hospital you know or even at the academy
886823 plans what makes you think im going to avoid those classes i cant do that ill get in trouble
886824 you know then dont you the guy i met yesterday and the tsukuda girl are siblings
886825 you really shouldnt hang out with him hes bad news
886826 i thought he was one of the nicest guys i ever met youre just being unfair
886827 hes emotional to the point where it gets in the way of a mission and he tells terrible jokes
886828 well it doesnt deter me in the least kakashi sensei thank you for telling me his name
886829 im serious dont go out with him itll only end badly
886830 but i dont like them in that way but hiromi just maybe
886831 o lord almighty god of israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are god over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
886832 it is true o lord that the assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands they have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by human hands now o lord our god deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone o lord are god
886833 therefore this is what the lord says concerning the king of assyria
886834 i will defend this city and save it for my sake and for the sake of david my servant
886835 now it is you father who makes me stand firm in christ you have anointed me and set your seal of ownership on me and put your spirit in my heart as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come
886836 lord bless this day in every way lord take charge of my day
886837 you have scattered abroad your gifts to the poor your righteousness endures forever
886838 arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the lord rises upon you see darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples but the lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you isaiah 60 1
886839 each of us is exposed to thousands of brand images every day most of which are not related to paid advertising
886840 we assume that incidental brand exposures do not affect us but our work demonstrates that even fleeting glimpses of logos can affect us quite dramatically
886841 apple has worked for many years to develop a brand character associated with nonconformity innovation and creativity
886842 and ibm is viewed by consumers as traditional smart and responsible
886843 this is the first clear evidence that subliminal brand exposures can cause people to act in very specific ways
886844 weve performed tests where weve offered people 100 to tell us what logo was being flashed on screen and none of them could do it but even this imperceptible exposure is enough to spark changes in behavior
886845 these experiments demonstrate that most any brand that has strong associations with particular traits could have the capacity to influence how we act
886846 instead of spending the majority of their money on traditional print and television advertising companies with established brand associations such as apple may want to give serious consideration to shifting more marketing resources to product placement opportunities and other forms of outreach that emphasize brief brand exposures
886847 if you know you need to perform well on some task say something athletic you may want to surround yourself with images and brand logos that represent success in athletics
886848 i was there at the first can show in cologne
886849 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
886850 oh god i sure hope the guy behind me slows down too
886851 is a great example of the contemporary portrayal of the hacker
886852 i was not a sharp child my first experience with the world wide web was purely academic i was taught that the internet was a tool used to further our understanding and to broaden our horizons this was a very common idea as illustrated by this vintage cbc piece
886853 on a beautiful clear spring morning joseph smith went to the woods and found a quiet spot where he could be alone
886854 when the light rested upon me i saw two personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air one of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other this is my beloved son hear him joseph smith history 1 16 17
886855 some years before he was called as an apostle himself elder robert d hales recounted an experience that demonstrated his fathers sense of that holy calling elder hales said
886856 some years ago father then over eighty years of age was expecting a visit from a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles on a snowy winter day
886857 robert he said through interrupted short breaths do you realize an apostle of the lord jesus christ is coming to my home the walks must be clean he should not have to come through a snowdrift he raised his hand saying oh robert dont ever forget or take for granted the privilege it is to know and to serve with apostles of the lord in conference report apr 1992 89 or ensign may 1992 64
886858 i think it is more than coincidence that such a father would be blessed to have a son serve as an apostle
886859 a sense of the sacred ces fireside for young adults
886860 in these latter days the lord revealed that when we obtain any blessing from god it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated d amp c 130 21 the lord makes generous promises and he certifies that he will not vary from these promises for said he i the lord am bound when ye do what i say but when ye do not what i say ye have no promise d amp c 82 10
886861 i am filled with wonder at the love my savior jesus christ showed by descending from the heavenly mansions and coming to a world where the majority rejected his message and even though they did not have the power to take his life they condemned him to death
886862 above all else this is the reason for my membership in the church because the holy spirit has penetrated my heart and has made it known to me that christ lives that he is my savior that he paid for my sins and that he has prepared the way so that if i live according to his precepts i can enjoy all other promised blessings
886863 in our society today i see so many people who blame others for their failures i have observed that those who accept personal responsibility for their actions are more successful than those who blame their shortcomings and lack of accomplishments on someone else
886864 this priesthood and these keys were conferred upon joseph smith and oliver cowdery by peter james and john and by moses and elijah and others of the ancient prophets
886865 may i now say very plainly and very emphatically that we have the holy priesthood and that the keys of the kingdom of god are here they are found only in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
886866 by revelation to joseph smith the lord said that these keys belong always unto the presidency of the high priesthood d amp c 81 2 and also whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth those the first presidency whom i have sent d amp c 112 20
886867 in this same connection the prophet joseph smith said you must make yourselves acquainted with those men who like daniel pray three times a day toward the house of the lord look to the presidency and receive instruction
886868 now brethren i think there is one thing which we should have exceedingly clear in our minds neither the president of the church nor the first presidency nor the united voice of the first presidency and the twelve will ever lead the saints astray or send forth counsel to the world that is contrary to the mind and will of the lord
886869 a decade ago the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles foreseeing this spiritual slide prepared a proclamation to the world on the family
886870 if you will heed that proclamation brothers and sisters you will be blessed god lives and loves us see 1 nephi 11 16 17 with his help we can foster our faith and families we can qualify for this promise from the lord if a man marry a wife by my word and by the new and everlasting covenant and it is sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise they shall inherit thrones kingdoms principalities powers and dominions d amp c 132 19
886871 members have had the holy ghost conferred upon them after their baptism see d amp c 33 15 35 6
886872 let all leave the cares of their work behind them let the kitchens take care of themselves and let the barns the flocks and herds take care of themselves and if they are destroyed while you are praying be able to freely say
886873 by leaving business and the cares thereof where they belong and attending strictly to worship in its season if not at first you soon will be united and be able to bring every evil principle into subjection
886874 you might ask yourself do i see the calling of the prophets and apostles as sacred
886875 do your actions show that you want to know and do what he teaches do you actively study his words and the statements of the brethren is this something you hunger and thirst for if so you have a sense of the sacredness of the calling of prophets as the witnesses and messengers of the son of god
886876 any criticism that the church of jesus christ of latter day saints does not hold the contemporary christian view of god jesus and the holy ghost is not a comment about our commitment to christ but rather a recognition accurate i might add that our view of the godhead breaks with post new testament christian history and returns to the doctrine taught by jesus himself
886877 the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent
886878 before the world was the gospel was central to gods eternal plan
886879 such faith will not prevent lifes problems but will help when things go wrong bad things happen to good people accidents occur some married couples may not be blessed with children others may not marry in this life or they may find themselves married to one who fails to keep the commandments of god the lord is aware of these circumstances he will bestow all the blessings that he has in store for his faithful children in his own way and in his own time be righteous be patient keep an eternal perspective and you will be protected
886880 the most valuable power we can possess is the treasure of a personal testimony of our lord jesus christ and his atoning power
886881 a testimony comes to us as we live a worthy life and seek it in prayer and the spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith d amp c 42 14 our lord counseled through the prophet joseph
886882 we demonstrate our love by how well we serve our god remember when the prophet joseph smith went to john e page and said to him brother page you have been called on a mission to canada
886883 brother page struggling for an excuse said brother joseph i cant go to canada i dont have a coat to wear
886884 the prophet took off his own coat handed it to john page and said wear this and the lord will bless you
886885 there are many qualities you will want to look for in a friend or a serious date to say nothing of a spouse and eternal companion but surely among the very first and most basic of those qualities will be those of care and sensitivity toward others a minimum of self centeredness that allows compassion and courtesy to be evident that best portion of a good mans life is his kindness said mr william wordsworth lines composed a few miles above tintern abbey 1798 lines 33 35 there are lots of limitations in all of us that we hope our sweethearts will overlook i suppose no one is as handsome or as beautiful as he or she wishes or as brilliant in school or as witty in speech or as wealthy as we would like but in a world of varied talents and fortunes that we cant always command i think that makes even more attractive the qualities we can command such qualities as thoughtfulness patience a kind word and true delight in the accomplishment of another these cost us nothing and they can mean everything to the one who receives them
886886 it is important to establish patterns of righteousness in your own life which will enable you to set a good example for your family whatever form your family may take
886887 the example of your righteous life will strengthen your family
886888 may i offer counsel of a general nature first with comments about general authorities
886889 if each and every one of us who are parents will reflect upon the responsibilities devolving upon us we shall come to the conclusion that we should never permit ourselves to do anything that we are not willing to see our children do
886890 one good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this in her presence do you think your noblest thoughts do you aspire to your finest deeds do you wish you were better than you are
886891 faith in christ includes the knowledge that following his crucifixion he arose from the tomb and his resurrection made it possible for all mankind to live again see 1 corinthians 15 21 23 faith in christ is the assurance that he and his heavenly father appeared to a young man joseph smith paving the way for the restoration of all things in the dispensation of the fulness of times jesus christ is the head of the church which bears his holy name
886892 under assignment from the first presidency and the twelve general authorities confer the appropriate keys upon presidents of stakes and of missions who in turn confer the needed keys upon bishops and upon quorum and branch presidents
886893 assigned to each one who bears the priesthood is a loving leader because mine house is a house of order saith the lord god and not a house of confusion d amp c 132 8
886894 from bearing one anothers burdens as ward members we have learned several lessons
886895 1 the lords organization is fully adequate to know and care for those with even the most dire emotional and spiritual needs
886896 2 adversity can bring us closer to god with a renewed and enlightened appreciation for prayer and the atonement which covers pain and suffering in all their manifestations
886897 3 members who suffer tragedy firsthand often experience an increased capacity for love compassion and understanding they become the first last and often the most effective responders in giving comfort and showing compassion to others
886898 oliver cowdery began work as josephs scribe on 7 april 1829
886899 oliver was with joseph when john the baptist appeared to restore the aaronic priesthood
886900 of the eleven men who were witnesses to the book of mormon nine apostatized
886901 the issue for us is trusting god enough to trust also his timing if we can truly believe he has our welfare at heart may we not let his plans unfold as he thinks best the same is true with the second coming and with all those matters wherein our faith needs to include faith in the lords timing for us personally not just in his overall plans and purposes
886902 joseph smith was a man of great faith even as a youth
886903 he was shot at beaten tarred and feathered threatened with death ravaged by sickness beset by legal entanglements imprisoned and chained forced to listen to the taunts of the most vile and evil of men and yet he only spoke with greater conviction of the truth of what he had seen and heard

886929 potential nigerian exports to the uae could include cotton rubber beans cocoa soya beans arabian gum and tea aluminium and precious metals such as gold and diamond
886930 uae companies are already investing in the nigerian telecom market and abu dhabis mubadala development company mubadala a leading business development and investment company based in abu dhabi is looking forward to enter nigerian markets
886931 after eventually being incorporated in emirates twice daily service to new york the quieter greener aircraft will be deployed on the london heathrow route from 1st december and on the sydney and auckland services from february next year
886932 we are very pleased to celebrate emirates inaugural flight from dubai to new york the first commercial service to touch down in the united states
886933 flying the first commercial service of the emirates a380 to the united states was thrilling
886934 although bigger than any other civil aircraft the a380 is smoother and quieter than any other commercial aircraft i have flown
886935 potential nigerian exports to the uae could include cotton rubber beans cocoa soya beans arabian gum and tea aluminium and precious metals such as gold and diamond
886936 uae companies are already investing in the nigerian telecom market and abu dhabis mubadala development company mubadala a leading business development and investment company based in abu dhabi is looking forward to enter nigerian markets
886937 the swelling demand for power in the uae is being fuelled by the rapid increase in population and unprecedented growth in the nations economy all of which requires tremendous amounts of electricity
886938 with government bodies focusing on ensuring that there is adequate power supply to sustain development we have identified the outstanding prospect in aiding their initiatives by providing highly secure power protection equipment which not only facilitates continuous electricity supply but enables power conservation as well in line with this we will be rolling out a specific plan which will involve new product launches and further investments into our product development to fully maximise the potential of this market
886939 despite the various challenges in power production being faced across the region which includes increasing costs and manpower issues and the continuously growing need for stable power supply we see significant movements to counter the offsetting effects of a potential power shortage to the regions economy and stability in the midst of these obstacles it is imperative for organisations to be fully prepared to adapt to the increased industrial demand for power as well as its own rising requirements it is our commitment to aid these companies by delivering robust power protection solutions and undertaking further strides which will assist in resolving these issues
886940 during the course of developing recipes we kept coming back to this phrase recipes you wish youd grown up with
886941 taqa has completed the issuance of us 1bn 6 6 per cent senior notes due on august 2013 and us 500m of 7 25 per cent senior notes due in august 2018
886942 the interest payment dates on the notes are february 1 and august 1 with first interest payments commencing in february 2009
886943 the proceeds of the offering net of applicable expenses will be used to repay borrowings under our credit agreement and for general corporate purposes
886944 taqa is taking advantage of the decline in interest rates to get funds for its expansion strategy outside the uae
886945 i believe taqa found it a good opportunity now to borrow to finance its operations i think it is a good decision to diversify its borrowing sources
886946 i just worked a long shift and we got those those things coming up
886947 well forget about it come with me for a night of escape
886948 are you saying im ugly i have plenty of cute clothes you love my yukata for the light festival if i remember correctly you still have it
886949 im not talking about cute or pretty those qualities are on the opposite side of sexy you gotta look scandalous forehead
886950 why are you dressed like that you never party that hard
886951 even when we wear our headbands well get carded in most bars because of our age and some wont let us in at all so forget about a good drink however i noticed something while i was out looking for you these past few days
886952 im thinking the bartenders actually know more about these kunoichi classes then male ninja do
886953 tenten also said something about this last year that they dont card any kunoichi past puberty around this time
886954 but what does that have to do with us we could just go to our regular bar for drinks
886955 and well some bars just arent open to us yet
886956 sakura how about we crash the hottest bar in town
886957 what is it out with it kakashi im busy today
886958 well you see i was gambling with genma when i err
886959 and what do you know its time to pay my mortgage
886960 what are you talking about ninja have mortgage grace periods of up to three months
886961 her voice was steady but angry she heard this plenty toay
886962 but last time it didnt go so well so perhaps you should assign a med nin
886963 i know what this is about ive already had six people who visited me today asking something similar
886964 i really dont think a quick mission like this one should be without a med nin
886965 which is why im not assigning you on one kakashi im forbidden to send any of the girls taking kunoichi classes on a mission for another month
886966 kurenai was in here just an hour ago begging for me to allow hinata to take these classes
886967 it was a personal request from hinata herself she was shocked when she received the letter a few months ago and when no one said anything about her not going
886968 i may not know her well but that doesnt seem like hinata at all sakura herself isnt very happy about these classes i dont even think ino is
886969 hinata isnt happy about these classes its just a means to do something on her own an escape ironically so ive made an agreement to keep it hushed i even took hinata off the official record for the classes rather for the next month she has sustained unfortunate injury to where shell be demoted to low stress missions
886970 i wish that we didnt have these classes ive spent the last three years trying to get rid of them as hokage i remember boycotting them as a young kunoichi
886971 i know she told me herself that she wasnt ready to delay it another year but i cant she has to do it this year
886972 why not wait another year why not delay the classes altogether
886973 most kunoichi her age have already lost their virginity kakashi among other things they are already adults
886974 shizune and myself are both responsible in overseeing birth control for ninja especially for the women
886975 even if she was sexually active which i doubt she probably wouldnt go to myself or shizune too embarrassing
886976 besides shes a med nin she could just get it at work if she wanted and no one would bat an eye she is also qualified in giving it out mind you
886977 cant you make an exception this year surely she can take it next year its been done before
886978 i cant do everything for her protect her from the world im the hokage and as it is kakashi im busy leave before i assign you a mission to find some rich ladys cat
886979 im not supposed to go in bars on normal occasions but madoka is a family friend so i imagine its okay
886980 we were just about to leave i have training and well hinata has something to do apparently
886981 i suppose i came on youth night everyone here is younger than normal thats okay i like younger girls
886982 im actually out of uniform but im a ninja too a jonin
886983 i have a sister your age actually shell be taking the classes with you
886984 its okay im just uncomfortable with it my name is sakura
886985 yeah im friends with the devil shes a good friend though
886986 naruto smashed into the poor ladies hut we were cleaning up his mess for
886987 your not happy about her taking the classes are you
886988 she has to take the classes three years in a row and will do six of those special missions in lieu of going to prison for a few years
886989 of course not i was just going to sort of accidentally kind of forget the classes
886990 at home why kakashi i dont even have work tomorrow
886991 of course i have those classes and what are you getting at
886992 im not twelve you sound like i did this morning i followed ino out i wasnt happy at first but madokas was open i wasnt going to pass this opportunity up
886993 what should i call it if this were any other time i wouldnt be allowed in
886994 so youre here because of that youre taking advantage of that
886995 i met someone new i was happy i actually forgot about it
886996 yes you never smile like that normally only when something great happens like your first birthday after the chunin exams when ino gave you that gift or when sasuke came back
886997 i was relieved to find someone to talk to a new friend
886998 friend what kind of new friend buys a girl that many drinks
886999 how can you say that he was only being nice he wasnt having a good day either
887000 its perfectly fair sakura chan men his age only want one thing around this time as you said certain things must happen i suppose it is more available
887001 busy busy too busy to drop your friend a word
887002 the hospital was so stressful this past month there were so many missions and
887003 so busy that when i went over to your house you escaped through the window
887004 you meant it that way otherwise you wouldnt of done it
887005 uh no im not going out with anyone right now
887006 sometimes you say to much sometimes you pry too much
887007 a week why didnt you just go to my house
887008 why couldnt i what about the fact that you shut me out every time i go there
887009 actually i went to the hospital after a stupid cat search mission i got that notice and i figured theyd give you longer hospital hours
887010 but you werent there a nurse said you looked tired but you werent at home so i supposed youd be drinking you do that on days like this
887011 listen forehead im sorry youd think id make you uncomfortable
887012 but you shouldnt of avoided me all you had to say was that you didnt want me to say anything
887013 okay maybe i would but if it really made you feel bad i wouldve stopped
887014 for what its worth i dont want to take the classes either but they took us off duty and we have to
887015 she wasnt too happy when i saw her after you left she threw a book at me for showing up late i didnt receive any compensation payment for failing the mission
887016 because if you really dont want to take the class then ill happily cancel
887017 you know for awhile now you have been acting weird
887018 do the classes intimidate you is that why you were speaking with tsunade
887019 we have somewhere to be ill see you another time kakashi sensei
887020 of course not i dont think a guy in konoha knows about these classes at least not any our age
887021 i wish they had to take them just not with us theyd probably enjoy it regardless however
887022 i bet you wont make it through the first class without giggling
887023 my cousin didnt show up for the first few classes and she was suspended from duty for a year
887024 peh ino pig youd be an expert at the class with all your knowledge you could teach it better than anyone just invite your boy toys along for a demonstration
887025 im just visiting well im sure something did somewhere especially with naruto on a mission but i dont know about that yet
887026 i was one of the ninja that went to pick up the pieces of the accident
887027 i had almost left when one of the nurses wheeled you out of the room
887028 now now no need to worry about that after the accident was settled she had a couple of drinks youre safe for now
887029 i heard you and ino talking well shouting after i left the bar last night
887030 it goes without saying that these classes are a ninjas duty
887031 there are many pieces of being a ninja that a person would argue against this is one of the more controversial notions even more so then our most violent acts as a ninja
887032 i suppose not but its still a duty you chose this path
887033 i dont come from a ninja clan i barely understood what the teachers meant at the academy when they got on this issue i thought it was a joke actually were soldiers not prostitutes
887034 you dont have to accept that kind of mission when it comes your way
887035 tsunade would never assign you to that type of mission
887036 the classes are to prepare you for what may happen in the future nothing more
887037 anko isnt just enthusiastic shes thorough other teachers before her never got into the material as in depth as she
887038 i just dont know why you are so worked up
887039 rather the most cruel part about all of this is
887040 a kunoichi who takes these missions are rarely a virgin
887041 they cannot go into these missions blind and theory alone rarely suffices
887042 its not that i think anko is out to get us
887043 its just what she is asking us is too much
887044 i remember that tenten telling us about it how one girl refused to say anything and when she did anko hadnt believed her one of the presiding elders pushed her to confirm
887045 err what are you doing here so early in the morning okaa chan
887046 i know you are busy sakura kun but this is
887047 dear you pay a fifth of what a hyuuga does in their own sector
887048 i love this scrub and my hair is brushed besides you made this scrub
887049 my grown up daughter threw caution to the wind and went out partying
887050 are you that hung over maybe you should call in
887051 sakura asked cautiously it was probably a very classified mission but she couldnt pin that one down most of the ninja in the operating room werent higher than chunin level
887052 you see that woman over there the girl with the broken arm
887053 thats not possible there are at least six to ten ninja at an outpost in a single moment
887054 well believe it there was a rather low class attack on the outpost and miss bravery over there decided to jump in without caution or orders
887055 three people died her captain and team mate perished on the field trying to sorry ass and they were taken over by the enemy nin they just barely escaped i had to go in there with a team and pick up the pieces of her mistake
887056 she wanted to be unavailable for the kunoichi classes the next few weeks ill tell you whatll happen to her shell be going to jail for what she did
887057 the kingdom of earth is full of miseries and the decree of the fates shall change the course of the heavens
887058 being related to someone is an accident of genetics but family are the people you choose to surround yourself with
887059 when people say they arent creative its because of some false ideas about creativity that we hold as a society one myth is that if youre a creative person its a trait and everything you touch turns to gold thats not the way creativity works its not some magical trait you have to work hard to be a more creative person you have to be diligent
887060 im happy because i am doing somthing that i love the most in this world and this what i love to do
887061 well i just had a bad day so when im not busy doing chores or homework i come to this lake to just hang throw rocks and just relax and it make me feel good
887062 well i just woke up from a nap and talked to two individuals that were feeling the same way i was on this sandy beach shore
887063 as i wait for the sunnyside walk to be reborn for the next day for me to walk on again
887064 i dont doubt these will taste good but how will they look
887065 you are not a suspect and nothing from this interview can be used against you in a court of law
887066 nyah nyah i did it and you cant get me
887067 suppose a storm is raging and the winds howl and the snow swirls about you you find yourself unable to stop it but you can dress properly and seek shelter and the storm will have no effect upon you
887068 likewise even though the internet is saturated with sleazy material you do not have to watch it you can retreat to the shelter of the gospel and its teaching of cleanliness and virtue and purity of life
887069 today there is much confusion in the christian world about the doctrine of christ not only about his divine nature but even about his atonement and resurrection his gospel and especially the commandments related to it
887070 the challenge to become applies precisely and perfectly to missionary preparation
887071 this year we commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the relief society women of the church rejoice as they reflect on past achievements of their organization and with foresight coupled with faith meet todays challenges and plan for future accomplishments
887072 he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious
887073 since our last conference we have had a delightful message from christopher s
887074 expressing on behalf of all missourians our deep regret for the injustice and undue suffering which was caused by this 1838 order i hereby rescind executive order no 44 dated october 27 1838 issued by governor lilburn w boggs
887075 children are open to gospel truths more than at any other time and
887076 consider these words written by abraham lincoln as part of a resolution in 1863
887077 we have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity we have grown in number wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown
887078 all scriptures are one in that they testify of jesus
887079 the savior himself declared the great worth of the book of mormon he said in 3 nephi this is my doctrine and it is the doctrine which the father hath given unto me 3 nephi 11 32
887080 the redeemer further declared in the book of mormon behold i have given unto you my gospel 3 nephi 27 13
887081 as a special witness i testify that jesus is the christ
887082 whenever we are inclined to feel burdened down with the blows of life let us remember that others have passed the same way have endured and then have overcome when we have done all that we are able we can rely on gods promised help
887083 president howard w hunter said a man who holds the priesthood regards the family as
887084 do not procrastinate someone has said that procrastination is the thief of time actually procrastination is much more it is the thief of our self respect it nags at us and spoils our fun it deprives us of the fullest realization of our ambitions and hopes
887085 fidelity to ones marriage vows is absolutely essential for love trust and peace adultery is
887086 husbands and wives who love each other will find that love and loyalty are reciprocated this
887087 the apostle paul provided sound counsel to guide our performance let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 1 timothy 4 12
887088 remember that the mantle of leadership is not the cloak of comfort but the robe of responsibility accountability is not for the intention but for the deed you must continue to refuse to compromise with expediency you must maintain the courage to defy the consensus you must continue to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong
887089 the devastated and displaced victims of hurricane katrina were hungry frightened people who had lost everything and needed food medical attention and help of all kinds but what they wanted and needed most was their families
887090 crisis or transition of any kind reminds us of what matters most in the routine of life we often take our families our parents and children and siblings for granted but in times of danger and need and change there is no question that what we care about most is our families it will be even more so when we leave this life and enter into the spirit world surely the first people we will seek to find there will be father mother spouse children and siblings
887091 the test of life is part of the purpose god had for us in the creation
887092 the prophet joseph smith gave us the lords description of the test we face
887093 so the great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and obey gods commands in the midst of the storms of life it is not to endure storms but to choose the right while they rage and the tragedy of life is to fail in that test and so fail to qualify to return in glory to our heavenly home
887094 there is a glorious miracle awaiting every soul who is prepared to change
887095 the essence of the miracle of forgiveness is that it brings peace to the previously anxious restless frustrated perhaps tormented soul in a world of turmoil and contention this is indeed a priceless gift
887096 my dear young friends my beloved boys and girls i am so grateful to be with you when you celebrate primarys 125th birthday
887097 i think there never was before a meeting such as this of boys and girls
887098 her suggestion was taken to the president of the church who at that time was john taylor he thought that if an organization would be good for little boys it would also be good for little girls because they would make the singing sound better and so way back 125 years ago the first primary met with 224 boys and girls to be taught obedience faith in god prayer punctuality and good manners in daniel h ludlow ed encyclopedia of mormonism 5 vols 1992 3 1146
887099 come listen to a prophets voice you are a child of god
887100 john taylor was a gifted and educated englishman a lay preacher of the gospel a man of recognized intelligence said he
887101 the more we obey god the more we desire to help others the more we help others the more we love god and on and on conversely the more we disobey god and the more selfish we are the less love we feel
887102 marriage is meant to be and must be a loving binding harmonious relationship between a man and a woman when a husband and a wife understand that the family is ordained of god and that marriage can be filled with promises and blessings extending into the eternities separation and divorce would seldom be a consideration in the latter day saint home couples would realize that the sacred ordinances and covenants made in the house of the lord provide the means whereby they can return to the presence of god
887103 sometimes as parents we feel we have failed when our children make mistakes or stray parents are never failures when they do their best to love teach pray and care for their children their faith prayers and efforts will be consecrated to the good of their children no family has reached perfection all families are subject to the conditions of mortality all of us are given the gift of agency to choose for ourselves and to learn from the consequences of our choices
887104 with all the feelings of a tender parent a message of hope to families
887105 too frequently women underestimate their influence for good well could you follow the formula given by the lord establish a house even a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of glory a house of order a house of god d amp c 88 119
887106 there is nothing that we are enduring that jesus does not understand and he waits for us to go to our heavenly father in prayer i testify that if we will be obedient and if we are diligent our prayers will be answered our problems will diminish our fears will dissipate light will come upon us the darkness of despair will be dispersed and we will be close to the lord and feel of his love and of the comfort of the holy ghost it is my prayer that we can find the faith courage and strength to endure to the end so that we may feel the joy of faithfully returning to the arms of our heavenly father
887107 jangan tanya apa yang diberikan negara kepadamu tanyalah dirimu apa yang telah kau berikan untuk negara

887109 es geht hier um die rechte unserer mehr als 360 000 kollegen die nicht beliebig verhandelbar sind
887110 ich bin weiter an einer einigung interessiert aber aus zuffenhausen wird st ndig l ins feuer gegossen
887111 wir f hren gute und offene gespr che in denen wir auch deutliche kritik u ern k nnen lesen dann aber wieder scharfmachereien und unterstellungen in der presse unter vier augen wird vern nftig geredet dann folgen wieder ffentlichkeitswirksame kraftmeiereien die herrn wiedeking zum titanen ausrufen
887112 es sieht danach aus als w rde jemand im hintergrund alles torpedieren weil er keine einigung will
887113 wenn man j rgen peters dazu braucht soll er dazukommen
887114 und wenn es jahre dauert kein gewerkschafter wird die mitbestimmungsrechte seiner kollegen kampflos aufgeben
887115 wenn die belegschaften des vw konzerns diesen vertrag k ndigen wollen dann geht dies nur wenn auch die arbeitnehmervertreter von porsche zustimmen 11 400 porsche besch ftigte haben dann die m glichkeit den willen von 360 000 vw besch ftigten zu unterdr cken eine solche regelung steht dem demokratieprinzip der deutschen mitbestimmung und unserer sozialen marktwirtschaft zutiefst entgegen
887116 rioters drove two vehicles to break into the border patrol armed police division
887117 gt gt after some googling i came across the suggestion of you
887118 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
887119 there are deficiencies in the summing up and other matters
887120 if i want to be a commercial success ill use time and audience tested routines already in the can fully scripted and filled with cut to the chase performing tips
887121 many critics of torture claim that it is ineffective as well as repugnant since people will say anything just to stop the pain the information gleaned may not be reliable on the other hand if people do say anything under torture you might expect some of what they say to be true and therefore if those being tortured really are terrorists useful to the authorities torture certainly helped induce guy fawkes to betray his co conspirators after they had tried to blow up king james i and the british parliament on november 5th 1605
887122 thanks for calling tech support your issue has been fixed
887123 security has been extremely tight with police and elite rapid action battalion force on guard at and around the voting stations
887124 i have been able to vote without any hassle at all because of the photographic id this has been immensely helpful to voters and polling officials
887125 the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billion dollars
887126 the field of unmanned and autonomous systems is evolving rapidly and new techniques are needed to effectively test and evaluate the capabilities that are being inserted into these systems this is especially challenging for systems that are increasing in levels of autonomy
887127 our task is to develop a roadmap that identifies new approaches to testing autonomous systems and details what needs to be tested how the autonomous technologies can be tested and when the testing needs to occur
887128 many new technologies are being developed for unmanned and autonomous systems that must be tested and evaluated before they can be deployed new approaches are needed for testing and measuring the robustness of these systems especially in non deterministic and evolving environments
887129 the only way to know how to test them is to understand both the details of the technology and the system that it is going into gtri has extensive experience in both areas and can uniquely couple fundamental research with warfighter systems
887130 there is a strong desire from the warfighter to get these systems into the field
887131 this coupled with the rapid pace at which unmanned and autonomous systems are developing creates a need to consider new options for more flexible testing of unmanned systems through this roadmap the government has asked us to help define these options
887132 the current roadmap award builds on gtris long term experience with test and evaluation for government customers and couples it with gtris strong knowledge of unmanned systems
887133 they are being chosen over manned systems when the situation involves the dull long mission times the dirty sampling for hazardous materials and the dangerous lethal exposure to hostile action and when the unmanned systems can provide capabilities that are not achievable by manned systems
887134 this saturday morning i was watching cnn and even if i dont understand english that well i saw that something strange was going on
887135 it is sincerely bad that some media reports preceded the governments announcement
887136 if the foreign ministry received communication from the us government then it should either report to the prime ministers office or make a public announcement
887137 i think it is extremely regrettable that the information was delayed
887138 even if it was a very minor leak we would like to have a firm grasp of the information we want to explain to local citizens consistently
887139 even if the leak this time is not dangerous i want that kind of accident to never happen
887140 residents want to know that kind of information immediately so i really dont understand why authorities need to hide it
887141 for them subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts the key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in
887142 but the iranian people will resist with force against the enemies
887143 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
887144 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
887145 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
887146 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
887147 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
887148 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
887149 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
887150 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time
887151 more and more of these drones and reduce the manned fighters and bombers overhead
887152 the missile head section launched from the barents sea reached its target at the kura exercise ground in kamchatka
887153 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
887154 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
887155 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
887156 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
887157 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat
887158 and the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe about to close
887159 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
887160 the international community is being watched not only by iran but also by irans neighbors and when the international community shows hesitation this is being perceived as weakness
887161 we live in a neighborhood in which whether you beat the bully or join it
887162 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table this is what we need to do today
887163 we decided and promised to make all the efforts to reach a peace treaty until the end of the year we are making all the efforts to do so
887164 but what is more important is now the understanding between israelis and the palestinians that we are on the right track
887165 persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof such as civilian members of military aircraft crews war correspondents supply contractors members of labor units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card
887166 all organized armed forces groups and units which are under a command responsible to that party for the conduct of its subordinates
887167 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
887168 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
887169 when we were in france we told them about the syrian position on irans nuclear issue but they asked us if we have details of the iranian programme
887170 in this trip we got details so in future if we are asked again we know irans position
887171 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
887172 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table
887173 although dsp 19 was never used for its intended missile warning missions it still provided valuable service in support of other important mission
887174 the dsp operational constellation remains healthy with an outstanding 37 year legacy of vigilant surveillance
887175 an anomaly placed dsp 19 in a non operational orbit and the air force and northrop grumman team used it as a test and checkout satellite to collect vital data to better manage the operational dsp fleet and improve future space systems performance
887176 flight 19 had a three year design life a five year design goal and lived nine years traveling in a much more hostile radiation environment than it was designed to withstand
887177 this satellite is a poster child for the amazing reliability of northrop grumman built satellites and is a testament to the technical savvy of northrop grumman and air force personnel we are proud to have been a partner with the air force on this program which has contributed to the nations safety and security for nearly 40 years

887219 faith in the lord jesus christ is evident when we believe his teachings and claim his exceeding great and precious promises and become partakers of the divine nature 2 peter 1 4
887220 in these latter days the lord revealed that when we obtain any blessing from god it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated d amp c 130 21 the lord makes generous promises and he certifies that he will not vary from these promises for said he i the lord am bound when ye do what i say but when ye do not what i say ye have no promise d amp c 82 10
887221 this is a day of quiet reverence and deep respect
887222 this is june 26 one hundred and fifty years ago june 26 was a wednesday that morning governor thomas ford of illinois who had come to carthage visited joseph smith in the jail

887224 confess them if that is necessary and then get them behind you parents and bishops stand ready to help your bishops have been ordained and set apart and promised wisdom beyond their own in working with you and assisting you isaiah said though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool isaiah 1 18
887225 you and i can be prepared with the words of faith and of good doctrine 1 timothy 4 6 and initially cleansed through the ordinances and covenants administered by the authority of the aaronic priesthood

887227 because family life can continue beyond the thresholds of death because the royal priesthood has been restored upon the earth and because the spirit has spoken to my spirit giving me a testimony that my savior jesus christ lives and that through his intercession i shall be able in accordance to my faithfulness to live with him for these reasons and others still i am a member of the only true church upon the face of the earth and i shall be eternally grateful for this
887228 the church has established two special times for families to be together
887229 this gospel will save the whole human family the blood of jesus will atone for our sins if we accept the terms he has laid down but we must accept those terms or else it will avail nothing in our behalf
887230 joseph smith told us that jesus was the christ the mediator between god and man and the savior of the world he told us that there was no other name in the heavens nor under the heavens neither could there be by which mankind could be saved in the presence of the father but by and through the name and ministry of jesus christ and the atonement he made on mount calvary joseph also told us that the savior requires strict obedience to all the commandments ordinances and laws pertaining to his kingdom and that if we would do this we should be made partakers of all the blessings promised in his gospel
887231 the saviors invitation is clear and direct and importantly for us it is constant come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden take my yoke upon you for my burden is light matthew 11 28 30 this is the lords promise to me and to you
887232 my prayer for each of us is that we will remember when the lord has spoken his peace to us and has encircled us in the arms of his love

887311 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing

887321 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests

887323 over the past 18 years tens of thousands of people must have applied but at most a handful won approval

887377 i cant take business trips to beijing thanks to the olympics it has already caused too much trouble to daily life
887378 we need the olympics but we need our normal life too
887379 its true that there is not as much happening in shanghai as in beijing these days but things will be completely different when the world expo takes place in shanghai in 2010

887388 oh and finding love is a matter of luck oh and unsettled lovers move from fuck to fuck oh and compare their achievements like discussing bereavements and compare their abrasions with romantic quotations
887389 the policy is directionally signalling a rate hike the demand growth could get affected delinquencies are rising on a year on year basis and this could be a worry
887390 the rise in rates have certainly impacted demand enquiries are now down around 20 25 also its taking a longer time for enquiries to close from around a week earlier to three to four weeks now

887400 it was under a rock we got two of them
887401 our advertisement on television and the internet is verygood except for local television
887402 obviously this is good news that the government wants toput out before the olympics
887403 many will be looking forward to the triple set of interest rate verdicts uk us and eu on wednesday and thursday as the source of further direction
887404 no outlandish claims just clear realistic information and conservative projections
887405 thanks for taking the time to teach newbies like me
887406 companies such as apple google and microsoft are not our traditional competitors but they are major forces that must be reckoned with our goal is to act less like a traditional manufacturer and more like an internet company
887407 target investments include companies creating innovative mobile applications and services that encourage rapid adoption of mobile solutions such as context and location based services mobile payments mobile advertising music and entertainment and other mobile services and software
887408 what do you think to gps enabled instant messaging good or bad
887409 of course we realize there are a lot of things we have to get right our focus is on getting the service right fixing any errors that we know and are being reported at the same time were focussed on ensuring we get as many devices properly supported as we can there has been a tremendous amount of feedback coming through the beta labs which is invaluable especially as we didnt have time for proper testing with all of the devices were supporting for the might work devices weve received a lot of feedback good and bad and that has been really helpful for us
887410 the features that people are requesting are spot on and sometimes its difficult to say anything as its already on your roadmap not to name any specific feature at the same time some of the feature suggestions we havent even thought of and of course those are interesting to hear about and we propagate discussion within our team we cant promise all of those features will be created but we start with the ones that match our vision and go from there
887411 time we have all sorts of cool visions but doing them before somebody else goes public is always a challenge
887412 its a great thing its been an adventure to get it working but hopefully we will be a bulldozer for some of the services that are coming from nokia
887413 per our longstanding company policy we do not comments on market rumours what we can say is that the new symbian foundation will provide a platform formed from symbian os and s60 with uiq and moap s technologies integrated available separately under the foundations royalty free license this is expected to take place in the first half of 2009 there are no further plans to integrate other technologies as a truly open initiative google and any party willing to access and or make a contribution to the foundation is welcome to do so and can sign up at www symbianfoundation org
887414 can sound soft strong or strange depending on where you come from where youre living your cultural influences and a multitude of other factors i thought everyone i knew would say it pretty much the same way so i asked a bunch of them turned out i couldnt have been more wrong
887415 ovi is pronounced with a short o like in nokia
887416 the highest value of email that people seem to appreciate and behave around is simply notification the phone makes a noise you know theres an email you like to be kept up to date and it doesnt even mean youre going to read the email the second one is what id call mailbox management one of the things weve learned is that people are deleting all of the dross so when they get back to their desk now theyre working with their real email the ones that need time to compose a reply
887417 the email client has got some eye candy making it easy to navigate with attractive use of space and icons as you scroll through your inbox you can read a portion of the first line of any email it expanding as you go through each one you can also select a whole lot of emails and manage them
887418 people have known that they can get email on their phones for many years now
887419 i guess my take on it is that its fairly challenging no one wants to deliver a service that feels like big brother is watching over and that anyone can see what you are doing at any given time the biggest challenge weve been facing in our thinking is in how we share location information in a way which is user friendly totally in your control and allows you to express yourself and isnt one of these big brother services where you can track another person yeah contextual services are the future and theres a tremendous amount of different things that we can do with location it will be really interesting to see what kind of applications emerge in the coming years
887420 time is one of the things that weve mostly neglected its one of the ket properties of context people have different behavioral patterns so i might be more prone to doing something on a given day in a certain time slots like play golf combine that with contextual properties and patterns in your life and there might be things we can do which recognize these patterns that might be interesting
887421 35 million gps enabled nokia devices in 2008 which is equal to the entire gps device market in 2007
887422 there are elections in america now along came a black citizen of kenyan african origins a muslim who had studied in an islamic school in indonesia his name is obama
887423 guys obama clearly isnt a muslim where did you get that crazy shit
887424 we believe that this agreement is positive for the industry enabling the market to benefit from innovation and new technologies
887425 its a fair price in the circumstances and in light ofthe market so its worth thinking about it but theres nodoubt on a longer term view we and other people can see fairvalue sitting significantly higher than these levels
887426 for me it was a dream to play for indias biggest club east bengal and after jc guha offered me the contract there was no looking back
887427 ram bahadur love for the red and gold shirt was amazing
887428 i signed in front of secretary mantoo ghosh that i will only play for east bengal until the end of my footballing career
887429 i never saw ram bahadur play a bad game in eleven years for the club such was his consistency and talent that he was like a wall in the midfield
887430 i was a little boy and i had went with my father to eastbengal ground to saw the match between east bengal and mohun bagan i can still remember that ram bahadur played a brilliant game against bagan ram bahadur covered chuni ghoswami so tightly that he could not touch the ball and as a result bagan lost the match by a goal in 1966 chuni ghoswami was in great form but i think ram bahadurs covering and blocking was excellent
887431 he was always smiling even in the most difficult situation i have never seen him loose his temper
887432 he was an excellent friend and a very good person whatever was the situation the trademark smile never abandoned him and he was never nervous he was the one who always kept the dressing room alive
887433 cut the hair out of my eyes and get a cute bob
887434 it is most unfortunate that at a time when a tripartite dialogue is going to be held to resolve the tangle at the initiative of the state government the gjmm activists have intensified their witch hunting against those who are associated with the cpi m
887435 it is queer that the gjmm on one hand has been paying lip service to the gandhian principles of non violence and on the other has been systematically hounding the political opponents of the hills the cpi m leaders in the darjeeling hills have been asked by the gjmm to surrender by 4 august this is an alarming development for all and particularly for those who are trying hard to restore peace
887436 our meeting with senior maoist leaders including prachanda at cpn uml central office in balkhu on sunday focused on forging a national consensus to form a new government
887437 god bless my mother all that i am or ever hope to be i
887438 the president is busy consulting the political parties about the formation of the new government and feels he should stay in the country to swear in the new government which could be formed any time
887439 750 paramush who just had surgery he will be raffling off some cool stuff too should kick off about 8pm until 11pm or later please be willing to donate thanks
887440 gps pinpointing comes naturally if you look at the strategy we have overall for services and software this is an expression of that strategy as we wanted to differentiate our im with the gps aspect bringing an extra dimension with the location functionality and were in the perfect place to do that as the device which youre using as an im interface is always with you and the fact that its always with you serves ability for automated presence information which becomes interesting it wouldnt be meaningful to do that on a pc instant messaging service
887441 the company we acquired plazes com is an interesting one ive been a fan of that for quite a while so weve been looking at that also we collaborated with the nokia maps team to find out what makes sense for the location aspect but for the standard im and the presence status we looked a number of competitor services the ones that we found to be most useful were the ones where users presence was given a lot of real estate we felt that the freetext status and the information on what you are currently doing was a valuable source of information
887442 the element of status presence is more elaborated the device can update your status automatically meaning you can express yourself now this is more valuable in the mobile space
887443 we get a lot of indian businessmen visiting indonesia we want it to get extended to tourists also
887444 not a single city can be found in india which is free from terrorism threat so there is no reason why certain states and cities should be avoided only
887445 we are focussing on promoting the sundarbans as a major tourist destination to both domestic and foreign travellers
887446 isnt it supposed to be like this the glory of first love and all that its incredible isnt it the difference between reading about something seeing it in the pictures and experiencing it
887447 read it again when youre older then youll get it and only then will you understand fully
887448 widgets are little web applications and come in many shapes and sizes widsets is a service that distributes widgets with some widgets you need some sort of widget program like the widsets client to see them if you have an s60 phone you can use fancier widgets that can do more stuff and can be launched directly from the application menu
887449 so youre saying people shouldnt get married til theyre 30
887450 you kiss that person ok now you kiss that person over there
887451 cadets is as far as i can tell having never been a cadet an excellent place for teenage girls to hook up with teenage boys better than high school even
887452 i had a chance to probe how chinese people think about touch or near touch interface a couple of weeks ago while the metro ticket system in shanghai is same as oyster uk or suica most people could not think of any other use of a similar system beyond that on the other hand their understanding of bluetooth wireless technology seemed to confuse many people about possibilities and benefits of near field interaction
887453 fully disconnecting is no longer a viable option or at the very least a deeply discomforting one so ingrained are communication technologies in our daily life
887454 the smarter question probes what were happy to share with whom and in what context its through the process of asking these questions that we get to debate re evaluate and rediscover whats important for ourselves and for the society in which we live
887455 maybe some time in the future mobile phones will grow in a pot like plants or maybe you could print a new phone
887456 so nokia buys symbian and donates all the code for symbian and s60 to symbian foundation to open source it it makes sense to me s60 is costing us a load of money since we have to essentially carry it on our own shoulders pretty much the only community around s60 is the community we pay to be there a few lone strong awesome warriors notwithstanding
887457 i doubt that open sourcing symbian is going to help in the community building though
887458 the problem with symbian is that very very few people touch it for fun so i believe that while we can open source it it is going to be very difficult to get people participate out of their own free will unless we are prepared to make very serious refactorings to the entire system
887459 still it is going to keep symbian in the game a little longer while many people dislike it just go to any finnish it newspaper discussion board to verify this the fact is that it does carry a significant amount of gold home every day so we must be doing something right and my bank account would very much like to us keep doing that
887460 spreading the manure out in the field where everyone can step on it does not necessarily make it better than keeping it in your closet it does however make new things grow better
887461 still i think this is a smart move open source improves quality by using the embarrassment factor people suddenly sharpen up in their coding when they know their work could be inspected potentially by millions of people even if nobody ever bothers to do so and that while it sounds insignificant does actually go a long way
887462 this move is also going to rekindle some interest from commercial companies linux has squeezed out all of the minor players out of the market but has left the big os providers like apple and microsoft relatively unscathed it is the second and third level tiers who really have to worry nokia has through our s30 s40 lines the ability to withstand the onslaught of new players for quite a while and still keep making money the open source symbian is going to make it more interesting for the third parties to use too since many times these decisions are made on political basis not technical
887463 it also suits well with our qt and chips strategy
887464 it is interesting to see how open source has really become a business strategy instead of an ideology
887465 we would like to see that everyone who wants an elmo live will be able to get one
887466 this pre order opportunity offers the best chance to those who order now that they will have elmo live on october 14th when it goes on sale in stores nationwide
887467 with todays technology weve been able to make the magic between child and toy even more seamless and exciting than ever
887468 this elmo is packed with unprecedented movement and an abundance of creative content never before featured in a plush product
887469 ever since prince was on appolonia since o j had isotoners
887470 im a movement by myself but im a force when were together

887473 i couldnt be more delighted that after the longest period ever between broadway productions of guys and dolls des mcanuff has agreed to direct this brand new production
887474 this is the first reunion of des with franks work since his brilliant production of how to succeed in business without really trying which i absolutely adored

887494 there is no apparent reason why their instructions should have been handled any differently
887495 the amount of r1 944 840 must be seen as a conservative estimate of the extent of the value of knbs proceeds of unlawful activity
887496 we applaud and support the council for debt collectors for the strong and unwavering stance they have taken in this and other matters in their effort to rid the debt collection industry of unscrupulous practices
887497 is these were as far as we know legitimate debts albeit collected illegitimately
887498 not only were venters suspicions that fraud was being committed confirmed but subsequent investigations by the council myself and inspector adele van staden of the specialised crimes unit in pretoria revealed that irregular and false court orders emanating from the joburg court were issued by knb on a much larger scale

887509 id seen him fight jason miller who is very good at jiu jitsu and he was able to stay out of a lot of his submissions i knew he would be tough and resilient and i knew it was going to be a war
887510 there are a lot of tough guys good fighters out there
887511 there are a lot of tough guys a lot of them believe me but you just have to fight whoever they tell you to fight
887512 im proud to be the wec champion and whoever i fight whenever i fight wherever i fight ill do it as the wec champion
887513 i want to see the figures we see the figures every day i will get the weather forecast later

887515 the team is certainly stronger now and better prepared psychologically to play in a final
887516 i attach more value to something i have won in a group than an individual award
887517 the olympics is a big deal in america in many ways a bigger deal than the world cup and the players are in good spirits and ready to go
887518 im going to really enjoy the olympic atmosphere im sure and im out to try and win a medal
887519 its an honor to represent your country and i look forward to taking part
887520 i feel pretty much as i did yesterday morning or last year
887521 its another step in a long process which has taken a lot of very hard work and which really started coming together about four or five years ago
887522 the whole world needs to continue seeing him as the enormous champion he has been and quite definitely still is
887523 people tend to talk about how my style leads to injuries but i think they have got that wrong i have only really had one troubling injury and that was in 2005
887524 i have worked hard on my game and feel much better about my ability to cover the court
887525 wimbledon has been an incredibly hard experience for me but this year i managed to do it better i managed to win

887527 she was bubbly and fun and really caring she couldnt wait to be a mum she would have been a brilliant mum we just wanted to be a proper family
887528 she was in a lot of pain and we were worried she wanted to stay at the hospital but they sent us home
887529 they tried so hard to save her and they looked after us really well we cant thank them enough
887530 kayleigh was great with kids she loved looking after my baby she would have been a mum in a million
887531 our condolences go to kayleighs family with whom we have already spoken
887532 i asked if theyd lost any keys and i was told that none were missing i asked to speak to a supervisor but they said she wasnt in
887533 their attitude just amazed me because there were so many keys on the bunch that anyone who found them could have opened all the post boxes in tyldesley
887534 its just lucky that these keys didnt get into the wrong hands people send important documents in the post and they could easily have been stolen had someone else got their hands on those keys
887535 leaving those keys in the door is a breach of peoples security
887536 i turned the keys and the door on the post box just opened i knew i couldnt leave them there so i locked up the door and took them back home to my mum i dont think its safe to leave keys in doors like that
887537 we did apologise and were genuinely sorry if we upset anyone but we never put anyones life in danger or did any of the things that have been reported were just two girls who went away for a week and had a few drinks on a plane
887538 that group included two of my cousins and we bumped into them
887539 but we went out with them once in fact we only went out twice the whole week people were calling us boring
887540 lynette was playing music on her mobile for about two minutes and the woman next to her asked her to turn it off which she did
887541 wed bought a bottle of vodka and were just having a drink and chatting
887542 lynette sprayed some perfume and the woman said it was giving her kids a headache then a steward came and asked for the vodka wed paid for it and he was obnoxious so we said no
887543 later another steward came and asked us nicely for it so we handed it over but the next thing we know someone is saying weve been diverted to frankfurt and we were going to be chucked off
887544 i got up to find out what was going on because i knew my kids would be at the airport waiting for me with my boyfriend and i was worried but they wouldnt listen
887545 but i never went near a door i wouldnt put my own life at risk let alone anyone elses
887546 we landed in germany were breathalysed and interviewed and freed within two hours we cant have been that much of a threat
887547 weve been made out to be this pair of slappers who went away for a boozy week and caused a load of trouble but thats just not us ive got to go in work and im dreading it
887548 without doubt road and public transport congestion places a significant cost on a region like greater manchester this will escalate substantially over the next decade
887549 congestion charging is a controversial solution but where it pays for investment in public transport extensive research shows that there are substantial benefits for the local economy as well as individuals from every social class businesses and large organisations
887550 self interested opposition groups have claimed that tif would have a negative impact on our economy but every piece of independent research supports our position

887552 we want to reach as large an audience as possible and we are striving to improve access whether thats physical access or through programming
887553 small independent cinemas often represent the hub of a local community but many cant afford to upgrade their facilities
887554 we hope these funds will make it possible for cinemagoers in manchester to enjoy film in a more comfortable environment
887555 were really pleased to be able to help more than 50 local cinemas improve their facilities and access

887559 no disrespect to stann but he does need to mix it up a little more
887560 i knew he was going to come with that jab 2 and the 3 2 to set up the left hook for the right hand he did exactly what i thought hed do he threw the occasional right kick it was exactly what i expected the only problem was it was my first title fight and my nerves got the best of me a little bit

887664 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqui is alive said elaine whitfield sharp a lawyer for siddiquis family who said she spoke to an fbi official on thursday
887665 the news sheds some light on one of the most intriguing local mysteries in the war on terrorism
887666 siddiqui who lived in roxbury and studied at brandeis university as well as the massachusetts institute of technology disappeared with her three children while visiting her parents home in karachi pakistan in march 2003 around the same time the fbi announced that it wanted to question her
887667 for five years us and pakistani authorities have denied knowing her whereabouts but human rights groups and siddiquis relatives have long suspected that she had been captured in karachi and secretly taken into custody
887668 military documents declassified in recent years suggest that siddiqui is suspected of having ties to several key terrorism suspects being held at the guantanamo bay detention center
887669 she is believed to have links to khalid sheikh mohammed alleged mastermind of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and allegedly arranged travel documents for another suspected terrorist papers in guantanamo bay also indicate that she married ali abd al aziz ali an alleged al qaeda facilitator who intended to blow up gas stations or poison water reservoirs in the united states

887738 the biggest challenge in the coming stage is for the gcc countries to achieve the plan for the monetary union on schedule in 2010
887739 in line with their fiscal convergence agreement the budget deficit should not exceed three per cent of the gdp while debt should remain below 60 per cent and inflation should not surpass two per cent this is another big obstacle for the monetary union
887740 the idea is to implement the monetary union in stages
887741 if we could achieve one or two of these stages in 2010 then it is an accomplishment
887742 the choice of fiscal criteria is complex in the case of gcc states because of their differences in expenditure rigidity oil dependency and oil and financial wealth
887743 as a possible fiscal criterion gcc countries could consider adopting an overall balanced budget target over the medium term based on a similar conservative crude oil price assumption across the membership with actual surpluses or deficits only reflecting the fluctuations in terms of trade
887744 gcc authorities could also establish targets for closely monitoring members non oil fiscal deficits including investment income to determine underlying fiscal trends
887745 it is yet another big challenge to the creation of the currency union on time although the date of launching this union is still officially set for 2010 recent statements by gcc monetary authorities have not indicated otherwise

887776 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

888033 i look at music as a universal force dividing music is an injustice to this language of souls my guru used to tell me one thing guru banke bajao shishya banke suno perform like a master and listen like a student it is this approach that gives me the openness to accept what the western musicians have with them i am a performer but at the same time a learner who is open to learning even from my students

888037 even a snail is safe if it follows safety rules
888038 if these posters are put up in public places like bus stands and railway stations and even aboard the means of public transport we are confident that the message will be absorbed by most citizens for the past three months we have been approaching several agencies but no one has volunteered to sponsor the drive the only time we were able to display these posters was during the lectures on safety that we conduct or as a part of tendulkars cartoon exhibitions
888039 the cost of affixing those posters to a thicker base and lamination comes to around rs 250 per poster which was borne by us however we are yet to do that for the translated versions as its becoming hard on the pocket
888040 we are negotiating with the managements of public transport and other organisations soon the posters will be on public display this is a matter of social obligation safety and welfare and will not be ignored
888041 the only motive in this initiative is to make the people aware that their safety lies in their hands neither have i charged for this nor will the bdds personnel get any monetary benefit for running the campaign its a pity that the very public for whom this campaign was initiated are hesitant to encourage it

888102 the najaf airport is a starting point for competition among provinces and local governments to make extraordinary progress toward reconstruction we were determined to face the terrorism that was about to destroy iraq the strong will of the federal government has fought and defeated it in all of its forms
888103 the benefits of this facility will ripple throughout the local provincial regional and national economy
888104 i would say the najaf people and the leadership here at the provincial level have a very national viewpoint on what this airport does for iraq
888105 about the only other way you could have gotten into this part of the country previously was by vehicle theres no train system that comes through here
888106 so this airport is going to be huge not only for najaf but it will affect the other major cities in the province of karbala and others north and west of here
888107 i think its a positive a good time to open this airport

888198 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 per cent or so still is very useful for us
888199 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
888200 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
888201 the continuing strength of the australian dollar has made it more difficult to maintain a competitive position for australian exports and has correspondingly made imports relatively cheaper

888204 we have received a letter from the guinean president indicating that our concession is under review
888205 we believe that the convention which was passed by the national assembly of the people of guinea is a valid act
888206 we believe weve followed all of the legal requirements and obligations of that convention
888207 the letter purports to indicate that the convention is being converted back to exploration leases
888208 you can bet your life that well take this very seriously and will fight for our rights
888209 weve got 2 000 people working on the project almost all of them guineans
888210 weve poured some 50 million back into the local community
888211 no permission is required for use of less than 5 000 words of the nab in print sound or electronic formats provided that such use comprises less than 40 of a single book of the bible and less than 40 of the proposed work

888213 justifications should also be made as to the reasons why payment was made to a supplier other than that which was awarded the contract

888217 this is one of most successful photo exhibits held in the mall because the throngs of people have not receded
888218 we now can share this photographs as we start to recover and move on
888219 there were so many faces feelings and scenes captured by our cameras that moved all of us
888220 captured the ilonggo spirit of resilience amid the most difficult time
888221 we wanted to capture and share the scenes that move us especially the struggle to survive and to overcome this unprecedented disaster
888222 it is my conviction that this matter is purely our partys internal problem which is ought to be resolved within its four corners
888223 i dont have any personal motive on the proposed investigation but i want to know the truth of the matter whatever findings we have will be referred to other government agencies such as the commission on audit or the ombudsman
888224 the bill must be opposed or amended so that it will favor property owners
888225 as it is the bill is unconstitutional because it assails our vested rights
888226 almost every part of boracay has been occupied for more than 30 years
888227 this bill is another insecurity for us because we can lose our properties that have been with our families since we were born here
888228 i will push through but if they can offer me a better version of the bill i will accept it
888229 the present ownership of lots on the island is in limbo we must have order
888230 there is no order now on land ownership in boracay wetlands are being covered and no build zones are being used we do not want the remaining trees to disappear
888231 if the bill becomes a law it will be economically beneficial to us because lands will be now titled and its market value will surely rise
888232 we must look at it with the greater good in mind
888233 our reforestation project is an undeniable fact truth be told we have already planted a total of 6 2 million trees on 14 313 hectares in all our geothermal sites we have not publicized it before because this is really not just for show we have reforested and we continue to plant more trees because it is part of our commitment to preserve the ecosystem as a good corporate citizen
888234 it is quite unfortunate however that some people deliberately miss out on this reality and just focus on the trees in the buffer zone to gain sympathy they also omit the information on what they have done to reforest or stop the charcoal making in kanlaon which we have monitored when we used to patrol the park for the province in the late 1990s
888235 they have mourned for the loss of the trees that we have cut they should likewise rejoice and welcome the hundreds of thousands of trees that we have planted which are already more than what is required of us in compliance with our moa with the provincial government
888236 also please take note that we will still reforest the 400 hectares that we committed in the moa for the next 5 years

888251 maka bertanyalah kepada orang yang mempunyai pengetahuan jika kamu tidak mengetahui qs an nahl 43
888252 barangsiapa yang bertakwa kepada allah niscaya dia akan mengadakan baginya jalan keluar

888257 perbuatan yang paling dicintai allah adalah perbuatan mulia yang terus menerus yang mungkin orang lain anggap kecil
888258 maka kami jadikan yang demikian itu peringatan bagi orang orang dimasa itu dan bagi mereka yang datang di masa kemudian serta menjadi pelajaran bagi orang orang yang bertakwa
888259 dan barangsiapa berpaling dari peringatan ku maka sesungguhnya baginya penghidupan yang sempit dan kami akan menghimpunkannya pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan buta

888263 berlomba lombalah kamu kepada mendapatkan ampunan dari tuhanmu dan surga yang luasnya seluas langit dan bumu
888264 dan janganlah kamu seperti orang orang yang lupa kepada allah lalu allah menjadikan mereka lupa kepada diri mereka sendiri

888266 saint stephen the great considers it a great privilege to serve as the face of durham cathedral through our operation of the cathedral shop we seek to be a part of the pastoral ministry to both the cathedrals visitors and to the employees of the cathedral shop
888267 unfortunately the shops have suffered under their new management to the point where many staff have felt unable to work under the new regime and have left some shops have apparently closed down of those remaining opening times stock availability and levels of customer service are in a state of flux and may not be as expected prospective customers would therefore be wise to phone ahead before visiting previous shop descriptions have been removed and ssg have been invited to provide up to date details they have not yet responded information about the shops shown here may or may not be valid updates on the situation will be posted in ukcbd news section as and when information becomes available
888268 because of the stated aims of the st stephen the great trust to further orthodox mission we feel unable to support the bookshops at the moment by purchasing goods ourselves or by recommending to our visitors that they visit your shop in sheffield
888269 is a visible sign of the churches commitment as they seek a deepening of their communion with christ and with one another and proclaim the gospel together by common witness and service its strength comes from people from different traditions finding new ways to work and worship together
888270 the cathedrals letter came out of nowhere and was a complete and utter surprise it was absolutely devastating to think that our charitys bookshop would be singled out because we are orthodox christians

888275 everyone thought i was going to have a boy my mom calculated it my dad calculated it the way i was carrying her the way i felt something here about how her water didnt break first but something else happened and when that other thing happened it also meant you were going to have a boy
888276 when she came out she even looked like a boy she had a full head of short black hair that stood up on end like a boy she didnt cry just let out one wail when the doctor slapped her butt
888277 she never cried as a baby she was so good and she always ever just smiled all the time

888291 some studies conducted by bronston college which is also located in a small town reveal that both male and female professors are happier living in small towns when their spouses are also employed in the same geographic area therefore in the interest of attracting the most gifted teachers and researchers to our faculty and improving the morale of our entire staff we at pierce university should offer employment to the spouse of each new faculty member we hire although we cannot expect all offers to be accepted or to be viewed as an ideal job offer the money invested in this effort will clearly be well spent because if their spouses have a chance of employment new professors will be more likely to accept our offers

888425 restringimos el acceso a los recursos a todas las m quinas de cigna incluidos 9 000 laptop
888426 no permitimos que la gente adjunte informaci n utilizando los ordenadores de sus hogares por ejemplo y s lo autorizamos el uso de blackberry como dispositivo corporativo aprobado para correo electr nico y telefon a remotas impedimos que los trabajadores tengan sus propias conexiones de correo y telef nicas
888427 por ejemplo si se cuenta con alg n tipo de contrase a para el encendido la persona que robe o encuentre el dispositivo no podr tener acceso a l es un buen paso para empezar
888428 probablemente las empresas prefieran no cifrar la totalidad del disco
888429 tener la posibilidad de encriptar archivos y carpetas y sobre todo correo electr nico
888430 este sistema protege los datos frente a usuarios ileg timos que hayan conseguido entrar en el tel fono y hacerlo funcionar en tales situaciones dado que los intrusos no se habr n identificado con las credenciales del usuario no tendr n acceso a los datos aunque puedan usar el terminal
888431 en general mdm proporciona lo que podr a encontrarse en un producto de gesti n de dispositivos pc pero para m viles
888432 ya se han desarrollado varios virus espec ficamente para explotar vulnerabilidades de tel fonos m viles y dispositivos handheld
888433 poco a poco la gente se est dando cuenta de que este tipo de medidas constituyen la nica forma de tener xito en lo que a seguridad m vil se refiere si la cuesti n no afecta directamente al individuo ste estar menos motivado en la protecci n de la seguridad
888434 algunas empresas tienen pol ticas que proh ben la utilizaci n de cualquier dispositivo aparte del suministrado por la organizaci n
888435 si los empleados tienen que introducir una contrase a cada vez que deseen realizar una llamada telef nica por ejemplo o si sus dispositivos han de ser desbloqueados cada 30 segundos finalmente terminar n intentando usarlos lo menos posible
888436 y ese no es el objetivo el principal motivo de la inversi n en movilidad es facilitar la comunicaci n y aumentar la productividad por tanto no se puede permitir que tal objetivo se sacrifique en aras de la seguridad es necesario encontrar el equilibrio
888437 la mayor a de las organizaciones est n s lo ahora empezando a darse cuenta de que realmente necesitan alg n tipo de seguridad m vil como base
888438 no existe a n un modelo dominante entre ellas pero al menos comienzan a ser conscientes de la necesidad de hacer algo al respecto
888439 en el que es uno de los l deres indiscutibles

888441 a minha chance de brigar pela vit ria seria ganhar as posi es de kovalainen e hamilton na largada
888442 j chorei muito e estou quase chorando de novo agora
888443 sabia que minha largada seria boa porque estava do lado limpo do asfalto
888444 passei o kovalainen e peguei o v cuo do hamilton ele se defendeu colocou o carro por dentro mas tive a possibilidade de me colocar por fora e jogar tudo na freada
888445 para vencer teria de deixar os dois para tr s ali depois n o haveria outra oportunidade
888446 mas eu n o tinha certeza ainda da estrat gia da mclaren
888447 vi na segunda parte da classifica o com o tempo que fiz s bado que ser amos muito r pidos com os pneus duros mas podia ser que eu abria do hamilton por causa da estrat gia da mclaren e eles me ultrapassariam no pit stop
888448 50 acreditavam que meu ritmo decorria do fato de termos mesmo um timo carro e 50 em raz o de a mclaren adotar estrat gia distinta da minha estar mais pesada
888449 mas medida que as voltas avan avam vi que n s ramos mesmo muito velozes
888450 minha equipe me avisou do problema com o pneu dianteiro esquerdo do hamilton e imediatamente reduzi os giros do motor
888451 tinha 23 segundos de vantagem para o kovalainen eu s perderia a corrida se tivesse um problema como infelizmente aconteceu faz parte do nosso esporte
888452 n o tive nenhuma sinaliza o no volante tampouco a equipe que monitora v rios sistemas do carro me avisou de dificuldades o motor explodiu como na austr lia de uma hora para a outra

888553 im going to finish the rugby season and make a decision then

888556 to finish on the podium in finland is fantastic its one of those rallies that you really really want to do well on and its great to add it to the cv
888557 i really want to thank everybody in the team its just really cool to be here on the podium the first time in finland with the new car and of course its great to be back in third in the championship
888558 we used greece and turkey as part of extended test program so this is the first event in which weve really focussed on our performance on gravel
888559 its been our first chance to really see how the car performs on gravel and how the work done in testing translates to a rally and it is clear weve made good progress
888560 chris did a great job and we learned a lot that we will take into new zealand later this month in particular as the next gravel rally as we continue the steep part of the learning curve that we are currently in
888561 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward

888571 its marvellous that the afl and the mcc melbourne cricket club have got together in this way because as we know they were parted
888572 this the mcg is the home of football melbourne is the biggest city in australia for sport so to me its an absolute natural fit
888573 so many things have gone on here with cricket the american army staying here during the second world war the olympics it just goes on and on the history of this area
888574 for football to be part of it to me is very natural
888575 theyve been here for 150 years so were delighted weve been able to convince andrew and the afl commission that we could do the job properly and allocate enough space and in the right manner that afl will get the respect it deserves in this hall of fame
888576 were very concerned that a lot of people it would appear have been taken in by a very professional scam and theres a lot of money that appears to have gone under
888577 well collect as much information as possible for the accc the australian competition and consumer commission as well as international law enforcement agencies
888578 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate find substitute tickets or whatever
888579 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
888580 this investigation shows that about 57 vertical steel bars may have been cut when the gantry was attached to the bridge well within the number allowed for under the strict safety controls in place and a small fraction of the 21 000 vertical bars inside the bridge
888581 the safety of the bridge was never in question and i am pleased this investigation has confirmed that
888582 damage to the bridges vertical web reinforcement was insignificant and no further engineering investigation is warranted
888583 i think deans has got no choice now hes got to throw him in there
888584 weve got one of the best lineout exponents in the world in dan vickerman hes been injured and came on as a replacement but weve got to obviously shore that up because the south africans are fairly good in the lineout with victor matfield so weve got to get our basics right
888585 it will be tough and im not saying they can do it but theyve got probably more chance of defeating the springboks than the wallabies
888586 itll be a horror trip for the wallabies theres no doubt about it
888587 just going on past history as much as were bad in new zealand were probably worse in south africa
888588 i think burgess came on to the scene with a great hullabaloo i think hes played reasonably well i think hes probably a little bit off the pace at the moment
888589 hes only a young guy and i guess like everybody when the forwards are doing well you look okay
888590 but what we want our players to do is under pressure theyve got to rise to the occasion and i think luke burgess was probably missing a little bit and it probably reflected on the way matt played
888591 giteau didnt get a lot of good ball the opposition flankers were on him almost immediately and as usual you try to overplay your game some of his kicking was poor and it just wasnt up to the mark

888602 its extremely disappointing its disappointing for the collingwood football club
888603 its disappointing for heath shaw given he is a senior player at the club
888604 when youre talking about this four weeks out from finals im sure anyone associated with the collingwood football club would be extremely disappointed
888605 despite that knowledge the state government saw fit to throw caution to the wind and the residents of collingwood park are now paying the price in the form of financial burden and psychological hardship as well
888606 its just stopped all the plans that i had to look after my parents
888607 im angry i have to fight back ive just got nowhere else to go with it
888608 weve now got a house thats worthless and impossible to sell
888609 weve really got no option but to pursue the government for the losses for something thats not our fault
888610 they are entitled to take whatever legal action is open to them and we will certainly be looking at it carefully and working with their lawyers to ensure that any obligations the queensland government has are fully met
888611 and if there are further matters that the court determines we are liable for we will meet those liabilities if there are any
888612 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party
888613 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
888614 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
888615 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
888616 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
888617 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
888618 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
888619 assimilabili per garanzie di indipendenza e articolazione di carriera i magistrati amministrativi a quelli ordinari
888620 che taluni magistrati potrebbero esercitare su altri colleghi per orientamenti giuridici etc proprio in occasione di un procedimento disciplinare un dato storico i richiami alla tradizione oratoria e ai padri dellantica
888621 davanti alla sezione disciplinare tanto pi se si tiene conto della mancata tipizzazione legislativa degli illeciti il diritto di difesa a partire dalla prima delle facolt che esso racchiude quella della scelta del difensore deve essere configurato in modo che nello stesso incolpato e nella pubblica opinione in nessun caso possa ingenerarsi il sospetto anche il pi remoto che il procedimento disciplinare si trasformi in uno strumento per reprimere convincimenti sgraditi o per condizionare lesercizio indipendente delle funzioni giudiziarie
888622 vi quindi stretta correlazione tra lindipendenza del magistrato sottoposto a procedimento disciplinare e la facolt di scelta del difensore da lui ritenuto pi adatto sicch limitare questultima facolt significa in definitiva menomare in parte anche il valore dellindipendenza
888623 come tutti i procedimenti disciplinari potenzialmente incidenti sullo status professionale tocca la posizione del soggetto nella vita lavorativa e coinvolge quindi beni della persona che gi richiedono di per s le garanzie pi efficaci
888624 con riferimento ai magistrati lesigenza di una massima espansione delle garanzie difensive si fa se possibile ancora pi stringente poich nel patrimonio di beni compresi nel loro status professionale vi anche quello dellindipendenza la quale se appartiene alla magistratura nel suo complesso si puntualizza pure nel singolo magistrato qualificandone la posizione sia allinterno che allesterno nei confronti degli altri magistrati di ogni altro potere dello stato
888625 la legge assicura lindipendenza dei giudici delle giurisdizioni speciali del pubblico ministero presso di esse
888626 sicch limitare questultima facolt significa in definitiva menomare in parte anche il valore dellindipendenza
888627 il massimo di incisivit delle garanzie accordate al magistrato sottoposto a procedimento disciplinare infatti non pu che convertirsi in una altrettanto incisiva tutela del prestigio dellordine giudiziario e del corretto e regolare svolgimento delle funzioni giudiziarie
888628 la scelta dellincolpato cade su un collega non in quanto appartenente ad una presunta corporazione di soggetti interessati alla tutela del prestigio dellordine giudiziario ma in quanto ritenuto in possesso dellidoneit tecnica per assumere una siffatta difesa
888629 la validit della scelta legislativa deve essere misurata sul piano dellidoneit tecnica del difensore
888630 allora restano prive di qualunque fondamento giustificativo la limitazione ai soli magistrati della sfera dei soggetti legittimati a svolgere lufficio difensivo e la conseguente esclusione degli avvocati del libero foro ai quali a causa del loro specifico statuto professionale lattitudine a difendere non pu essere disconosciuta
888631 a norma della costituzione i magistrati siano ordinari o amministrativi si distinguono tra loro soltanto per la diversit delle funzioni giurisdizionali esercitate il consiglio di stato e gli altri organi di giustizia amministrativa esercitano la medesima funzione giurisdizionale
888632 assimilabili per garanzie di indipendenza e articolazione di carriera i magistrati amministrativi a quelli ordinari
888633 non pu considerarsi manifestamente irragionevole la decisione del legislatore di consentire che laccusato ricorra ad un difensore ma di limitare in considerazione della funzione svolta tutela dellordine pubblico la sua scelta ai dipendenti della stessa amministrazione
888634 in primo luogo a differenza di quanto sostiene il giudice rimettente le argomentazioni della corte costituzionale formulate nella sentenza n
888635 procedimento si svolge secondo moduli giurisdizionali sentenza n 145 del 1976 in base al principio costituzionale di garanzia dellindipendenza e dellautonomia della magistratura
888636 in base al principio costituzionale di garanzia dellindipendenza e dellautonomia della magistratura

888661 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
888662 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
888663 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics

888774 oratory is the parent of liberty by the constitution of things it was ordained that eloquence should be the last stay and support of liberty and that with her she is ever destined to live to flourish and to die it is to the interest of tyrants to cripple and debilitate every species of eloquence they have no other safety it is then the duty of free states to foster oratory
888775 not until human nature is other than what it is will the function of the living voice the greatest force on earth among men cease i advocate therefore in its full extent and for every reason of humanity of patriotism and of religion a more through culture of oratory and i define oratory to be the art of influencing conduct with the truth set home by all the resources of the living man
888776 eloquence cannot exist under a despotic form of government it can only be found in countries where free institutions flourish
888777 the speakers of the present day are called pleaders and advocates and barristers and anything rather than orators
888778 you may rest assured that he is the worst speaker who has the loudest applause
888779 the history of the world is full of testimony to prove how much depends upon industry not an eminent orator has lived but is an example of it yet in contradiction to all this the almost universal feeling appears to be that industry can affect nothing that eminence is the result of accident and that everyone must be content to remain just what he may happen to be for any other art they would have served an apprenticeship and would be ashamed to practice it in public before they had learned it but the extempore speaker who is to invent as well as to utter to carry on an operation of the mind as well as to produce sound enters upon the work without preparatory discipline and then wonders why he fails
888780 the speech of one who knows what he is talking about and means what he says it is thought on fire
888781 in an orator the acuteness of the logicians the wisdom of the philosophers the language almost of poetry the memory of lawyers the voice of tragedians the gesture almost of the best actors is required nothing therefore is more rarely found among mankind than a consummate orator

888846 the fact that i can exercise a modicum of control over the way i see myself even if the rest of the world is at odds with that is something that i think is fantastic and the same goes with all the other girls across the world who do the same sometimes risking open ridicule for it sometimes simply dressing the way you feel you should is an act of courage and to me thats the greatest thing

888867 the reports he has given me are firsthand not hearsay
888868 what i am saying is that we need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland and that we need to stop repeating claims being made on the air lest we end up getting splattered with the collateral damage when certain issues of false claims embellishments and lapses of integrity begin to come out more here seems like the bentley bam has run out of steam finally

888874 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
888875 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
888876 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
888877 i think its come to a point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of the fans
888878 this is a very important step in the evolution of chinas relationship with the world
888879 it assumes that there is infinite space for future generations we have to allow people in the future to build their environments based on their own needs and intelligence
888880 i think our sense of our ancient lineage gives us a perpetual sense of obsolescence
888881 i think we know that whatever were experiencing now is part of a long passage each new dynasty replaced the buildings that had been constructed by the last one
888882 architects are trained to be perfect men in the pursuit of absolute truth theyre taught that their ideas should be made concrete in the form of a building that lasts forever but thats selfish
888883 architecture schools have become too vocational and focus too much on professional and skill based training and not enough on leadership the education should be a lot more philosophical

888896 derek conways younger son received 50 000 in pay and pension contributions even though no evidence was ever found that he worked for the money
888897 mr conway also pocketed a 163 000 windfall from the sale of a property understood to have been subsidised by the taxpayer there are still no answers to questions as to whether mr conways other son henry did any work for the 32 000 he was paid
888898 mr conway clings on to the old bexley and sidcup seat in parliament and will pick up a fat pension from taxpayers after the general election but all he is paying back is a derisory 13 160 in 12 installments
888899 if i was him i wouldnt be able to sleep at night with the guilt
888900 we note that freddie conway seems to have been all but invisible during the period of his employment for the majority of that time he was based at newcastle where he was engaged in a full time degree course at the university he had little or no contact with his fathers office either in the house or in the constituency no record exists of the work he is supposed to have carried out or the hours kept
888901 why on earth is this man being given so long to pay back the money he wrongly took from taxpayers it is crazy he is still being paid by the taxpayer
888902 the arrangement made for me is similar to that for other mps of other political parties other than that i have no further comments to make
888903 there is growing concern at garda overtime costs as the need for financial restraints is evident

888912 despite the recent sharp increase in sugar prices in the futures market there are still significant discounts in the physical market although we are optimistic regarding price trends throughout the 2009 fiscal year we do not expect either sugar or ethanol prices to climb by more than 15 percent
888913 in the second quarter of 2008 our revenues grew at a rate that is reflective of the current economic environment with consumers purchasing power under pressure in this context we have been increasingly focusing on our price position we are fortunate to have our most powerful private label offering ever giving our customers high quality alternatives at great prices we are committed to fund price investments and offset underlying cost pressures through major savings initiatives that will have a lasting effect on our organization we continue to focus on our long term strategies which will make us even stronger when we emerge from this challenging economy

888920 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
888921 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
888922 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
888923 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
888924 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
888925 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
888926 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
888927 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
888928 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
888929 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
888930 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
888931 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
888932 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
888933 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
888934 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
888935 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
888936 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
888937 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
888938 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
888939 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
888940 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
888941 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
888942 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
888943 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
888944 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
888945 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
888946 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
888947 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
888948 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential

888951 im quite disappointed to tell the truth as i hoped to do a lot better today
888952 by the last few laps of the first race the rear tyre wear was pretty bad and thats why we changed the tyre before race 2 unfortunately that was the wrong choice and there wasnt much i could do after the first few laps

888956 get off that kid that jet ski that jagged rocky ledge
888957 for you were buried with christ when you were baptized and with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of god who raised christ from the dead you were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away then god made you alive with christ for he forgave all our sins he canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross
888958 so the trouble is not with the law for it is spiritual and good

889009 lieber kurt beck wir sozialdemokraten praktizieren seit fast 150 jahren meinungsvielfalt und eine anregende debatte zur l sung unserer aufgaben f r eine demokratische und solidarische gesellschaft in deutschland in europa und weltweit wir die f nf antragsteller im nrw parteiordnungs verfahren gegen wolfgang clement streben nach wie vor eine solidarische l sung innerhalb unserer dozialdemokratischen familie an dazu aber muss von unserer partei erwartet werden dass wolfgang clement sich in gleicher weise kompromissbereit zeigt wir sind weiterhin damit einverstanden dass wolfgang clement nicht aus der spd ausgeschlossen wird und f r seine parteisch digende warnung vor der wahl der spd im hessen landtagswahlkampf nur eine r ge erh lt wir schlagen deshalb erneut vor dass wolfgang clement im verfahren vor der bundes schiedskommission nur eine r ge erteilt wird von ihm selbst wird daf r erwartet dass er erkl rt seine parteisch digenden aufrufe zur nichtwahl der spd in zukunft zu unterlassen wir w nschen euch im parteivorstand f r eine einvernehmliche l sung innerhalb der sozialdemokratischen familie und f r die erreichung einer kompromissbereitschaft von wolfgang clement eine gl ckliche hand
889010 jeder darf seine meinung sagen aber kein spd mitglied hat das recht von der wahl seiner eigenen partei abzuraten
889011 das w rde nur als kurswechsel und abkehr vom agenda kurs interpretiert werden

889017 if you think of the 33 1 3 series of books as a kind of extended family please go with me for a second on this one then my book is the black sheep its fiction
889018 this short unassuming novella of 102 small pages captures more of youth with all its painful mad obsessions and enthusiasms and all its longueurs than any number of much longer books if youve ever been young and in love with a band you have to read meat is murder

889033 the definition of that choking is when you are a winning position and you dont win so for a couple of weeks we have given people ammunition to make those comments
889034 we kicked 3 11 in the second half and if we had kicked 6 5 then we win the game and that is the biggest reason why the roos who kicked 7 5 after half time won and we didnt
889035 the last two weeks we have kicked inaccurately and conversion accuracy is one of footballs great skills getting the ball in the first place is difficult but converting is the cream on the cake and winning and losing comes from that
889036 we believe we can use our complementary skills we gained in ukraine and cis very effectively in belarus to differentiate best as soon as possible
889037 drought and a noticeable shift of resources from sheep to cropping is likely to have seen the national sheep flock fall a further 6 5 percent in the year to june 2008 to around 80 million head making it the lowest australian sheep flock since 1920
889038 smaller declines in the flock are now anticipated resulting in a base of around 76 million head by 2011
889039 after suffering a sharp fall in real farm cash incomes in 2006 07 with rising costs and debts many lamb producers were simply not in a position to meet the very high cost of fodder and grain required to carry lambs over into 2008 hence supply is expected to be particularly tight through this winter leading to a high seasonal spike in lamb prices
889040 however the local and global demand supply balance for lamb continues to tighten providing the prospect of higher lamb prices and attractive returns to lamb producers once seasons improve
889041 this years business awards are by far the most professional competitive and sustainable city of sydney has ever produced small and medium businesses play a vital role in our local economy and were proud to support their good work

889046 theres always a burning ambition to play another premiership thats why you play football but its certainly not eating away at me
889047 its something that you aspire to and youd love to win as many as you can but the reality is it doesnt always happen
889048 im pretty pumped about being able to reach the milestone alongside gav because hes obviously someone i looked up to and someone i marvelled at over my career
889049 hopefully thatll go and inspire other players to be able to do it or it might inspire some young indigenous boy in the sticks that wants to play afl footy and be like gavin wanganeen and andrew mcleod and play 300 games
889050 hopefully someone can go on and beat it but its there and im pretty proud that my name is going to be next to gavin wanganeens
889051 couple of weeks ago it was all doom and gloom but its nice to be back in the winner circle
889052 weve given ourselves a chance now we are back amongst it and the beauty of it is we hold the cards to our own destiny as a footy club this year and thats how you want to be
889053 you dont want to be relying on other teams to do things for you
889054 i dont think ive got the coaching bug i dont think its in me i enjoy working with the indigenous communities and im doing some study at the moment so hopefully ive got a few areas where im covered

889078 despite challenging market conditions we have delivered a record set of interim results we remain on track to deliver record results for this year in line with our expectations
889079 as previously announced for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 we expect the strength in the infrastructure sector and the weakness in the commercial property and open market housing sectors to continue
889080 through our strategy of focusing on the current and future needs of our customers we have delivered strong growth in the first half of 2008 and by continuing to invest strategically we have extended our services into industry sectors which provide us with a platform for future growth and margin enhancement

889106 in the first three weeks of july we experienced stronger poker trading and significant growth in both our bingo and sportsbook businesses our various strategic initiatives are progressing well and given the good start to the third quarter and our clear business strategy we are confident of delivering future growth during 2008
889107 it is a complete system and network that affects every job
889108 that helps us manage the color from start to finish in the proofing plating and press processes to guarantee the quality in color correctness of each and every job
889109 we wanted to create value for our customers and not be just a commodity
889110 we ended up venturing into mailing services fulfillment services digital printing both static and variable database management and cross media campaigns with email personalized urls and print my goal when i came on board here five years ago was to take all of the existing services along with new areas we have entered into to create value solutions for our customers
889111 we do not want our customers to think of us as just a printer
889112 the combination of the finalproof with this color management system has created a much better match from proof to final press sheet
889113 it has also created a significant improvement in our customers confidence in our ability the people who used to come in and do press okays do not even do that anymore because they are so comfortable with our ability to match the proof now
889114 the makeready time at press has significantly dropped as well
889115 we are now able to deliver what the customer wants in those color critical areas
889116 the benefit of the taskero universe system is that you have live support behind you
889117 from a monitoring standpoint fujifilm is looking at our production equipment and spotting variances and deviations maybe even before we do to have the fujifilm team behind us is a huge opportunity
889118 if anything goes through the system and is out of tolerance you know it immediately
889119 i have the confidence that the proof the client has approved is something the pressmen can match
889120 we have benchmarks that we have set up on different substrates
889121 one of our operators was selecting the wrong benchmark for a proof he was trying to read as a result the verification was failing a fujifilm response team member noticed through the data upload from our database that something was wrong and called immediately that shows how proactive the color team performs it is a priceless benefit to have when trouble shooting and there is no time to waste
889122 so again the ability to go back to your customers internal and external and give them a colorpath verified proof is a confidence builder for your customer base
889123 we deal with many customers who are going to be producing a longer press run maybe for collateral materials
889124 then they might want to output 200 pieces for a specific trade show or conference and well print them digitally we now have the ability to match the colors as close as we can between the digital and conventional worlds we feel its very critical to match those two departments
889125 fujifilm has helped us immensely from the standpoint of managing the color as well as helping us with the finalproof
889126 our color quality proof qualities and consistencies are much improved
889127 um es klar zu stellen wir die bundesbeh rden sind interessiert

889129 we are excited to bring this new printing methodology to our customers
889130 there have been others who have attempted to do wide gamut printing
889131 but ccn is really doing it right that is why we wanted to be one of the first ccn certified expert consultants for this methodology
889132 in my role at bell i see jobs through from initial concept to photo shoots direction art production pre press and even final press checks i have high expectations for color reproduction primarily because i was there to see the actual aircraft and i know how it should look using ccn vivid high gloss paint reproduces with remarkable richness and accuracy
889133 color control network is very pleased to be aligned with alder technology inc and commend them for their long time commitment and their unwavering dedication to improving commercial printing practices
889134 the unique capabilities of the xeikon presses in general and the xeikon 6000 in particular are key enablers for the development of even better and more sophisticated applications and profitable business opportunities

889136 we are delighted that a company of this caliber has chosen to continue using our technology business is clearly booming for them and we in turn can provide new advanced technologies to support their growth their choice is an excellent endorsement of our benchmark print capabilities i look forward to a long and fruitful relationship as both our companies continue to flourish

889143 the notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated devout and ancient culture smacked still smacks of neocolonialist legerdemain
889144 the surge has reduced violence we should all be thrilled about that and honored by the brilliance of those who have served in iraq but what were talking about here is whipped cream on a pile of fertilizer a regional policy unprecedented in its stupidity and squalor
889145 try as i might to formulate a further response to joe kleins rant i cannot one can argue facts one can differ on interpretation of events or one can discuss policy but one cannot debate raging venom
889146 is that the canard of jewish disloyalty has now apparently found a home at a major msm publication
889147 joe klein is free to say what he wants and the rest of us are free to point out the foolish and ad hominem nature of his pronouncements as well as his past words
889148 they seem to have the power to hurt peoples careers i was really angry about what happened with rob malley you know its amazing to be attacked as an antisemite by extremists who i think are very dangerous and they seem to think when you look at what pete wehner said or what jennifer rubin said on their blog a couple of days ago i cant imagine why time hasnt shut this guy down and fired him and blah blah blah blah blah thats what they want to do they want to stifle opinions that are different from theirs im certainly not going to back down

889158 the uk housing market fell off a cliff in 2007 and has continued to plummet during 2008
889159 never has a market failed to recover over a four to five year period if the market has not recovered by 2012 it will be the first time in the history of the uk housing market
889160 well be working with our international agency contacts throughout the world providing them with whatever information that we can but im afraid to say australians are just amongst the large number of those internationally who have been caught by the scam
889161 i starting making the phone calls to find out exactly the date that they were going be here the tickets and the phone rang out and i thought thats a bit unusual
889162 so i stated sending emails and i got no responses and then i started doing a bit more investigative work as far as looking at the company how it exists and found that even as early as march people were complaining in london that it was a scam
889163 if you put beijing olympic tickets in to google this was the first site that came up and in fact it came up ahead of the official chinese olympic site so how is it that a site like that could have operated at least 11 months if not longer without anyone in officialdom taking any sort or action against them
889164 we wanted to create a small town on the stage and since lauren and i were the primary players i wanted to put our name in it
889165 it was like a religious experience so intense so much energy i wanted to create a spectacle like that i enjoy bands that create a universe where you can explore all the nooks and crannies of their imaginary world
889166 the trick is not to be a wall of noise we struggle to maintain the balance of loud and quiet
889167 part of the fun of having so many people on stage is that theres always something fun to look at

889174 we are once again extremely pleased with this sales trend
889175 and we also have an optimistic outlook on the rest of 2008 not least because of the deals initiated at drupa by further strengthening our sales team and clearly focusing our sales activities we will continue to accentuate the strengths of gmg in the second half of 2008 and this will also have a positive influence on the coming year 2009

889191 for the office market its exciting to have this level of control
889192 we look at this as security at all points of the device document security security on the device the devices hard drive and how it acts on the network
889193 even if you physically remove the hard drive the data is encrypted
889194 there are some verticals like legal medical and hr that have the need for confidentiality and security
889195 and just in the general workforce a manager whos printing out a performance review or an employee printing out their own review they want to make sure its secure

889209 the xinjiang police have broken up three to four terrorist groups so far this year thats it
889210 didnt have the ability to launch large scale destructive activities that the enemy forces would have hoped for
889211 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
889212 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
889213 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
889214 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
889215 i think irregular warfare is very important particularly in contrast to preparing solely for conventional warfighting but it shouldnt be our only focus
889216 we ought to be training our forces and procuring our weapons systems to reflect the reality
889217 the chiefs were provided an opportunity to review the document by the secretary
889218 they were grateful and they did provide comment and are comfortable with the final product
889219 some people here always had money but money without curiosity means nothing now theres more willingness to explore
889220 how am i supposed to know if someone is a prostitute
889221 the problem from our perspective has not been an absence of information going into the pakistani government
889222 they have struck like this many times we are trying to convince them to share information
889223 then we can hit such targets ourselves otherwise its a violation and nobody in pakistan will like it
889224 it wont cost much but we dont have the gadgets

889230 securityholders are recommended to take no action at this time
889231 in our opinion the indicative proposal of 4 40 a security is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano and we believe it is highly unlikely that the asciano board will accept such a bid
889232 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
889233 no decision has been made in respect of any preferred funding option
889234 asciano continues to assess a range of options and consider a range of factors in determining the optimum financing strategy for future growth

889249 if the reports are true it would be a significant victory
889250 the demolition will make a precedent to do the same with other buildings and then we will lose the most valuable part of our city
889251 this election is an important step on the road to a truly democratic cambodia
889252 there are many many steps remaining for this country before it is a fully functioning democracy but when you look at it from a vantage point of cambodias recent history in the last 10 years or so you can see clear progress
889253 under the leadership of the three party leaders cambodia has become a more developed country
889254 if you vote for cpp you will have more roads schools hospitals pagodas and everything
889255 local miscreants or were part of a larger pattern of terrorist attacks
889256 in all these cases they have created the blast using timer devices
889257 they were small bombs and were only the equivalent of one or two grenades
889258 i was driving to the airport and there was total panic with people calling and asking loved ones are you okay
889259 said sayed zacharia a taxi driver who was near one of the blast sites
889260 everyone heard ringing in their ears and fear in their minds
889261 a stronger law would help but we also really need to find out if there is a central brain behind all of these bombs
889262 for that we ourselves need a central brain to investigate them in india people have been demanding this for a long time and political parties have not done this
889263 we have been fighting criminals ruling the roost for a long time this just happened to be a stark display for the world to see
889264 we need pakistan to put more pressure on that border

889268 if you keep saying lets do it together but if you wont then well do it alone then what youre doing is undermining the spirit of working together to begin with
889269 we need to be very sensitive to the fact that pakistan doesnt see the world exactly the same way we do they dont see the threats the same way that we do
889270 it is really sad that our whole town suddenly became a battleground between local taliban and security forces which has paralyzed life
889271 we will release them only when the government frees our taliban prisoners
889272 we had hoped that the chinese leadership would reciprocate our efforts by taking tangible steps during this round on the contrary due to their excessive concern about legitimacy the chinese side even failed to agree to our proposal of issuing a joint statement with the aim of committing both parties to the dialogue process
889273 the chinese side expressed the view that the dialogue process has been productive and that we need to keep in mind that a half a century old issue of great complexity cannot be resolved in a matter of years
889274 the talks this time were disappointing and no breakthrough was achieved at a critical time when the international community expected progress in the buildup to the olympics
889275 it seems that hard liners in china are fixed upon a failed policy in tibet and blocking an achievable solution
889276 i dont have troops i can reach for brigades i can reach to send into afghanistan until i have a reduced requirement in iraq
889277 afghanistan has been and remains an economy of force campaign which by definition means we need more forces there
889278 i have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be solve this problem diplomatically
889279 the taliban and their supporters have without question grown more effective and more aggressive in recent weeks as the casualty figures clearly demonstrate
889280 we all need to be patient as we have seen in iraq counterinsurgency warfare takes time and it takes a certain level of commitment
889281 a couple of weeks ago i told you that the wia and the australian communications and media authority acma had signed the agreement that would allow the ballot for two letter callsigns to go ahead and that the information would be placed on the wia website on 1 august that is last friday
889282 people have seen my work seen my record now the nation is watching what i am doing
889283 we have this culture in india and being a dalit woman i faced more of it doubly as a dalit and as a woman
889284 so just get high while the radios on just relax and sing a song drive your car up on the lawn let me play your guitar
889285 a valiant effort and one that pays homage to some of the great songwriters of our age
889286 postmodern cut and paste construction graced with passages of prettiness
889287 love songs leavened with a bracing touch of reality and darker tales with rays of hope
889288 for those that like sitting alone in the dark ruminating on what might have been
889289 i am the rare superfan who has no qualm with any of the 18 songs chosen
889290 the ruling dynasty is under pressure to show its population that the oil money is being reinvested for the good of the people the al sauds have suffered from the image of the ruling family as corrupt and spending lavishly
889291 the stone age did not end for lack of stone
889292 are part of a broader effort to diversify the economy away from oil and away from its reliance on the public sector the cities are intended to develop more of a non oil economy well before the oil runs out
889293 when there was money it was easy to absorb young saudis into public jobs but the population kept growing and the local education system did not produce enough candidates for the local job market that caused resentment and allowed militant groups to launch against the local dynasty
889294 hope citizens receiving this message will not take bus lines 54 64 and 84 tomorrow morning
889295 first i will report to the leaders who are responsible for transportation and wait for their orders
889296 the public expectation for the government response is above the governments capabilities
889297 i think the counter terror measures being taken are also formidable and perhaps insuperable except for individual acts of self sacrifice that are hard to prevent
889298 foreign terror groups should be viewed as less a worry than domestic sources because the latter though fewer and less well organized have the advantage of blending in
889299 i thought things would get easier the longer i stayed but its the opposite
889300 the new policy is not as strict as might be imagined
889301 those who apply to come to china for justifiable reasons will be given every convenience
889302 he said that the deteriorating security situation is very very real and that weve got a lot of work to do as it relates to that
889303 i think he heard and saw a lot of that today
889304 the taliban have dispersed and were hunting them down to make sure they dont do something like this again
889305 the people of afghanistan and the international community have come to the reality that pakistan intelligence institutions and its army have become the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism and extremism to the world and particularly to afghanistan
889306 i feel like the last man standing all the responsibility is on my shoulders there is no turning back if i turn back i betray all my comrades
889307 their biggest goal in life is to return the party to the lady
889308 they wont do anything they are just guardians because of them their party is divided
889309 the nld has lost the trust of the people they have been issuing many announcements that the government must do this but the government has not and anyone who gets involved with the nld gets in trouble
889310 this vote gives a clear message to the world that indias head and heart are sound and india is prepared to take its rightful place in the comity of nations
889311 i have always said the deal was important and now we know it
889312 the irony is that for india this is the best deal since sliced bread its hard to imagine a deal that could have been sweeter
889313 india has been given all the benefits without any of the responsibilities of moving toward nuclear disarmament
889314 we have to start thinking like a big and powerful country let us not worry about how the world is going to impact us but think of how india can impact the world
889315 we must never take our decision based on the fear of the unknown
889316 this is a shameful day for indian democracy all for the sake of this nuclear deal
889317 how low can this government fall in their desperation to please america
889318 we have wasted a lot of time and political energy in building consensus for the nuclear deal in india now there is very little time left to complete the international procedures
889319 even the parliament debate became a political show members raised issues of price rise loan waiver for farmers and murky deals the real issue that is the nuclear agreement got diluted somewhere
889320 homes shops and the mosque in the village of wanat for cover
889321 very troubling to all of us here is an increase in violence that is directly attributable to tribal areas across the border in the north west frontier province and the baluchistan areas in the south that allow the insurgents to maneuver
889322 it causes a much greater security challenge inside afghanistan the problems of security issues in afghanistan are linked to security issues in pakistan
889323 we want to be positive we want to cooperate we want a long term relationship we want a partnership so how serious are you in broadening that relationship that is what we want to know
889324 our position is that president musharraf has played an important role but things have changed significantly and the message of the people is very clear and that message has to be understood
889325 musharraf will stay as long as the parliament thinks he should stay and let the parliament take that decision
889326 i think they are beginning to realize that they have to see beyond musharraf individuals are important individuals do provide leadership but ultimately you have to rely on institutions
889327 because there are a lot of people in afghanistan questioning the way things are being governed
889328 an opportunity has come and if they do not grab it will go
889329 i begged him not to post anything sensitive not to oppose the government
889330 huangs personality is always to hold out until the end he feels his conscience needs to speak for those who have grievances
889331 scarlettle benim bu konu hakk nda s yleyebilece imiz pek bir ey yok
889332 while the arctic is melting the g 8 are postponing action instead of climate protection the world got nothing but flowery words
889333 we know very well that there are many countries in the g 8 grouping that share our ambitious expectations and therefore it is regrettable that the lowest common denominator in the g 8 determined the level of ambition
889334 the lesson of this summit is that the emphasis is on implementation and on delivery
889335 the emphasis is on turning words into action and making them far more concrete than ever they have been in the past
889336 we had a comprehensive agenda on helping those who are being affected by disease live healthy lives
889337 is not going to achieve the desired impact we are all looking for we need more money
889338 you might say it doesnt sound like a lot but we think we worked to really embed the idea of g 8 accountability
889339 in retrospect the targets they agreed to at gleneagles appear to have been a stretch
889340 several of the member governments simply are not going to meet their targets the commitments were unrealistic with good intentions
889341 donors are yet again off track in delivering upon their commitments and with every off track year that passes fully delivering the commitments by 2010 becomes more difficult
889342 in other words when people say theyre going to make a pledge to feed the hungry or provide for the ill that we ought to honor that pledge
889343 we believed that these things like culture like traditional architecture like history like identity are really really important for afghanistans future
889344 theyre something that all afghans can unite around regardless of ethnicity
889345 before the wars this handiwork had a lot of value but during the mujaheddin time and taliban time it was lost
889346 after karzai came and this project started the handiwork was valued again this is why were here
889347 as these houses are being built our country is being rebuilt im only unlucky that i dont live here in murad khane but in another neighborhood
889348 afinal na o faz assim tanto tempo que na o mando uma queca
889349 hope that the dalai lama would treasure this opportunity and give positive response to the requirements of the central authorities
889350 how hard would it have been to confirm that a road we paid 15 million for was ever built it is appalling that the defense department did not send any embassy officials working in pakistan to verify these enormous costs
889351 apparently the bush administration cares so little about the hunt for osama bin laden that it is barely paying attention to how the pakistani military is carrying out the fight
889352 for a large number of claims defense did not obtain sufficient documentation from pakistan to verify that claimed costs were incremental actually incurred or correctly calculated
889353 the more i learn about u s coalition support funds to pakistan the more i am troubled first in terms of waste fraud and abuse of a huge amount of u s taxpayer funds second about the programs failure to achieve vital u s security objectives and third about the programs incompatibility with a long term strategic partnership between the u s and pakistan
889354 the political fixation on large scale engineering projects to keep urban taps flowing at little or no cost to consumers meant that consumption was divorced from consequence
889355 we cant have an effective agreement unless china and india are a part of it
889356 its as simple as that im going to remind our partners thats the case
889357 sustainable development has to be supported by both financial resources and technological resources
889358 until that happens how do you expect the developing countries to take up quantitative restrictions
889359 the isi is a professional organization and it doesnt interfere in the affairs of any other state
889360 the documents from the suspects and their confession clearly show that pakistan terrorist organization isi was behind the attack
889361 i do believe there are individuals at the lower field levels who are maintaining ties with extremists and the taliban and maybe al qaeda on their own or are in the cahoots with one or two other people like that
889362 and we hope that in time the south korean people will listen
889363 a friend asked yesterday did i believe in one world
889364 of course i believe in world one and how can i possibly do otherwise you can redeliver that message now in this age of democracy in the age of awakening of the poorest of the poor
889365 we were optimistic about the market last year but theres such a big distance between reality and our expectations
889366 chinese clients think the rooms are too expensive or the hotels arent conveniently located and theyre afraid of being cheated the foreign clients just hesitate to make a decision
889367 so many people expect the olympics will help make chinas economy even more prosperous but in china the government operates everything as a result the olympics are not that efficient economically speaking
889368 i just got the key of my new apartment last weekend i need to buy tiles paint sinks a toilet kitchen appliances a wood floor but several construction stores told me they got government notices encouraging them to close during the olympics
889369 what it points to is that the opposition is becoming more effective
889370 it is having a presence in more areas being better organized better financed and having a sustainable strategy in all their strategic situation has improved
889371 this agreement provides the best monitoring conditions the wfp has ever had in north korea
889372 this marks a major advance in the way we work in this country
889373 we now have a much greater degree of randomness in our access
889374 now they have agreed that we can travel within 24 hours of applying for a permit
889375 peace cannot be brought with force and aggression this will be very unfortunate for the pakistani nation if fighting starts again
889376 this is an operation with the limited objectives of applying adequate force to increase the parameters of security in peshawar and establish the government here where it has been challenged
889377 mangal bagh has been here for quite some time now but its a fact that we have tolerated him because weve been told to do so
889378 its like an undeclared curfew here now in bara and other parts of khyber agency
889379 it is a very confusing situation for the local people on the one hand they dont like bloodshed on the other hand they want to get rid of this situation created by mangal bagh and his lashkar e islam
889380 for hygiene conscious japanese the romance with these toilets is equivalent to the american romance with the hummer
889381 the governments insistence on parading the torch through lhasa can only undermine the respect and trust required for a genuine dialogue process with the dalai lama
889382 i want to see other places and do other things here nothing changes
889383 the earthquake hit us nothing we can do about that it was the work of heaven now we have to deal with it
889384 our mothers and fathers teach us from an early age
889385 an outline of how cafeteria staff and dot employees needing assistance can work together to provide employees with a positive experience
889386 as weve gotten deeper into the process weve been troubled by additional information about north koreas uranium enrichment capability
889387 and this information has reaffirmed skepticism about dealing with north korea
889388 they have been either seeking or have gotten or have done something on the highly enriched uranium side
889389 the students in 1921 had the same feelings of anticipation perhaps even trepidation of starting something new that the students have today
889390 from the rooftop you can see the moonlight high above the clouds just enough light to see your face

889414 die umsetzung von einem so komplexen regelwerk das seit 25 jahren existiert und viele feinheiten und optionale regeln aufweist ist nat rlich nicht so einfach alleine die 250 zauberspr che die dsa kennt konnten wir nat rlich nicht alle bernehmen trotzdem sind wir sehr sorgf ltig vorgegangen wir haben die regeln zuerst 1 1 bernommen und dann geschaut funktioniert das auf dem pc macht es spa wenn es probleme gab haben wir ganz vorsichtig justiert immer in absprache mit der dsa redaktion und den fans jeder dsa spieler wird sich in drakensang zu hause f hlen auch wenn wir das eine oder andere detail ein wenig ver ndert haben
889415 einige bereiche haben wir vereinfacht was zu diskussionen in der community f hrte zum beispiel die gesamte regeneration das haben wir nicht leichtfertig gemacht aber wir dachten f r ein reibungsloses gameplay und den gr ten spa ist es sinnvoll manche dinge zu ver ndern wir mussten bei der umsetzung des regelwerks nat rlich aus dieser riesigen f lle von archetypen regionen zauberspr chen und anderen dingen eine schnittmenge herausgreifen die wir in der n tigen qualit t umsetzen k nnen und einige charakterklassen wie zum beispiel geweihte aber auch geoden druiden oder hexen haben wir bewusst rausgenommen aber wer wei vielleicht reichen wir diese ja irgendwann noch nach

889417 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
889418 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
889419 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
889420 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
889421 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbours
889422 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
889423 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades keep it up
889424 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
889425 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is

889435 we may have to accept less than we wanted if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 percent or so still is very useful for us
889436 despite the challenging economic environment our operating profitability has improved significantly over the prior year although we have made significant progress in expense control we will continue to seek opportunities to maximize our operating cash flows
889437 our success is being driven by the strength of our solutions which enable our clients to retain and enhance relationships with existing customers provide great customer experiences and demonstrate a quick and measurable return on investment
889438 we continued to benefit from the diversity of our enterprise class customer base and increasingly broad portfolio of value added solutions that have gained significant acceptance in the marketplace
889439 the explosion of data coupled with increasing compliance requirements is driving the need for customers of all sizes to retain protect and recover information these new solutions complement our existing data protection software portfolio by offering backup and recovery features tailored for remote office and mid market customers
889440 it is not the first time the army has looked after security and public order i remember sicilys anti mafia operation after the murders of the judges falcone and borsellino in the 1990s and operation domino after 9 11
889441 one complication in discussing all this is the assumption readily made that the blessing of a same sex union and or the ordination of someone in the act of a same sex relationship is simply a matter of human rights i am not saying that is claimed by people in the church but you hear that from time to time you hear that in the secular press and that is an assumption i cannot accept
889442 services revenues were lower due in part to our transition to on demand implementations which average less than half the time of our perpetual on premise implementations
889443 our performance in the second quarter has enabled us to show improved profitability compared with the first six months of 2007 our services and solutions business is growing particularly strongly on the one hand and we are now starting to see a tangible increase in our new integrated product offerings on the other
889444 ncrs strong second quarter results were broad based geographically and speak to continued solid demand for our self service solutions even in a challenging global economy consumers want to connect interact and transact with businesses in new ways and ncr is at the forefront of helping our customers meet that demand

889457 backwards compatibility as you know from playstation one and playstation 2 is a core value of what we believe we should offer and access to the library of content people have created bought for themselves and accumulated over the years is necessary to create a format playstation is a format meaning that it transcends many devices psone ps2 and now ps3 if the developer wrote the game according to our technical requirements checklist we will have what we believe will be almost perfect backwards compatibility
889458 i believe that the sixaxis controller offers game designers and developers far more opportunity for future innovation than rumble ever did now rumble i think was the last generation feature its not the next generation feature
889459 we have made a technical change to the machine which moves us from being a hardware embedded backwards compatibility solution to one which is a combination of hardware and software
889460 i think the consumers that get their hands on a playstation 3 clearly see the value and not only want to buy one for 599 in some instances theyre willing to pay ridiculous prices on ebay
889461 encourage buyers of the entry level playstation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system
889462 has been the result of extensive research into the entertainment needs and preferences of the next generation ps3 owners
889463 were still better off using that money that wed put into backwards compatibility in either investing in new games or using that money to help support bringing the price down so that people can get into the franchise
889464 this is the third continent out of three but it is the most important

889468 anything with microsoft or vista in the headline and defaming the company is a surefire way to get attention who cares if its chairman is the largest donator to charity so what if almost everyone uses windows microsoft office and internet explorer although firefox is gaining the point is they cant do anything right and makes a great topic to stir up the hornets nest

889508 zimbabweans are looking at the current talks with cautious optimism they are very weary of the likely outcome from these negotiations as you are aware in 1987 there were negotiations between the zanu pf and zapu zimbabwe african peoples union and the negotiations came up with a unity agreement that basically failed to address the core issues basically the agreement led to the annihilation of the opposition in matabeleland
889509 zimbabweans are quite weary that for the mdc to go and negotiate with the zanu pf such a scenario like the previous talks might come out of those negotiations the second thing is that zimbabweans are quite cognizant that whatever negotiations take place their will or their decision in march 29 is non negotiable which means that the decision that they made that the mdc is the government they would want to be in place needs to be respected in any negotiation process
889510 the fact that the sadc southern african development community and the au african union are monitoring the peace process does not give zimbabweans confidence based on the fact that the two bodies have had their credibility eroded to a large extent the aus acceptance of robert mugabe to go to the au summit after the african union and pan african parliament and sadc had all declared that the election in june were not an expression of the free will of the people of zimbabwe was an indictment on the au it was a sign that the au body is complicit with mugabe in terms of subverting the will of the people of zimbabwe
889511 so there is some hesitance on the part of zimbabweans to say there is no guarantee that the au will protect their vote more importantly that it was exacerbated by the resolutions that came out advocating for a government of national unity
889512 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail
889513 if someone thinks that this pro european government will give up on defending national interests for the sake of european perspectives they are wrong
889514 our position is firm there will be no cooperation with the so called international criminal court
889515 the correct position for the au therefore should be to investigate ourselves

889546 in 1908 new york city police commissioner bingham claimed that jewish criminals committed one half of all crimes in the city the jewish community responded to binghams charge by claiming that jews held the moral high ground and beyond a few gangsters did not commit crimes despite their public response the jewish community was well aware of its own criminality and set up various organizations to address the problem due to its proximity to new york city sing sing prison has housed thousands of jewish criminals from 1880 1950 including numerous minor offenders notorious gangsters and the only civilians to be executed for treason julius and ethel rosenberg

889561 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting
889562 now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
889563 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
889564 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad then said the jews unto him thou are not yet fifty years old and hast seen abraham
889565 thou are not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham
889566 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw and was glad
889567 thou are not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham
889568 abraham saw his day while the jews said you are not even fifty years old and you have seen abraham
889569 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
889570 verily verily i say unto you that even before abraham was i was in existence
889571 for even thereunto were ye called because christ suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
889572 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was with them did signify
889573 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater than the treasures in egypt
889574 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
889575 him god raised up the third day and showed him openly
889576 and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them
889577 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant
889578 how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
889579 they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
889580 behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son
889581 and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
889582 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made
889583 who was the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that there in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or of powers all things were created by him and for him
889584 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
889585 therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send the prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
889586 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god

889588 canadian nationalists trying to ring fence our sovereignty are engaged in an especially ironic struggle given their citizenship in the nation that invented the modern more supple form of sovereignty federalism those who are most determined to draw deeper lines in the ongoing crusade against american encroachment on our national sovereignty are often the strongest advocates of canadas leadership in the development of global governance through multilateral institutions the contradiction reveals less about their convictions about sovereignty than about their plain vanilla anti americanism

889622 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him
889623 if one must be willing to do anything to get it
889624 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
889625 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
889626 to be saved then it is no longer a free gift only god knows how many people have been steered
889627 to forsake certain sins in their life in sharp contrast the bible declares in romans 4 5 his faith is counted for righteousness
889628 for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
889629 galatians 1 6 9 which is based upon self righteousness lordship salvation is diametrically opposed to the gift of god a genuine gift is free with no strings attached proponents of lordship salvation claim to believe that eternal life is a gift yet they completely contradict themselves when they teach that a sinner must be willing to surrender to christs will and forsake sin to be saved it is clear from 1 carnal
889630 acts 10 43 its a very simple yet powerful truth please dont become a victim of lordship salvation if youve already bought into the lie then i plead with you to as jesus commanded in john 5 39 i realize that there are hundreds if not thousands of different gospels floating around on the internet nowadays however there is only one genuine gospel message presented in the scriptures and it is a message of gods unconditional love for us undeserving sinners who sent his only begotten son into the world to pay for our sins so he could freely offer us the gift of eternal life in christ jesus revelation 22 17 you dont have to be willing to do anything to be saved all that is required for salvation is that you come as a guilty sinner romans 3 19 and believe on the lord jesus christ to forgive your sins acts 16 30 31 you dont have to surrender your life to christ to be saved in romans 12 1 3 we find the apostle paul begging the believers at rome to surrender their lives to christ brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service

889675 ye be wearing me crop on yer head blasphemy defilement
889676 not more of ye this island should be unplottable the weather is killing me crop and changing the magnetic field ye should never have been able to come here
889677 if its killing the crop maybe thats whats making everyone sick
889678 wait a minute you mean this place is like being underwater
889679 it does feel like when i fall in the sea
889680 ill curse ye all where ye be if ye dont be leaving right now
889681 cant ye see one of me crop has died already
889682 ahhh a skeleton a skeleton has killed one of me crop and hes wearing it as a wig stop wearing me crop as wigs
889683 robin chan says its like being underwater so this place is affecting the devils fruit users weve got to get them back to the ship
889684 then i saw the mini merry crashed on shore and swam over i was just looking down another path when i heard you yell whats going on
889685 i think im starting to see the funny side of this island
889686 getting them back to the ship this place is acting like seastone on them
889687 the only thing hes king of is sleeping all day and getting lost
889688 yer the king of me crop yeve got to save me it thats why yer here
889689 that explains why the island has all the properties of being underwater marimo grows in lakes
889690 this be akan island a precious island to conserve our crop marimo be sacred to leprechauns it brings good luck like shamrocks and rainbows but it started dying out people be greedy taking it for their own good luck faster than it can grow back its our dream to save the marimo
889691 we used our magic to give the island lake qualities above the ground so we can guard it and it can grow in peace and remain a natural treasure
889692 is that so mr leprechaun what are you doing with treasure
889693 i be a leprechaun we have pots of gold at the bottom of the rainbow
889694 there be none anymore that be why me crop is dying there be no rain for months all the other leprechauns have gone to find the culprit
889695 the islands magnetic field is getting detected by log poses weve always prevented that but now intruders be arriving and our rain dances dont work
889696 that sounds fun well help you what does this rain dance look like
889697 wake up wake up you had a smart sleep idea
889698 ive made rain clouds with the clima tact plenty of times
889699 if i i mean if the marimo king makes it rain for you there would of course be a matter of tribute
889700 i will give ye one of the marimo in return for your saving me precious crop
889701 or i actually think the king would appreciate something else perhaps i dont know your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow hes going to so kindly make for you
889702 no yer fine now i see yer just the marimo kings slaves
889703 there be others who arrived before ye theyve been hiding in the fields stealing me precious marimo
889704 there be no ship they came from no where like ghosts like monsters
889705 massive monsters both of them they come and steal me marimo crop
889706 the marimo king will save his marimo defeat the monster thieves and make it rain
889707 yell use the power of yer kingly crown within the marimo
889708 theres a pot of gold to think about you guys get going and ill help franky can get the mini merry back and he can fix the crows nest while youre gone
889709 didnt you hear him this island is supposed to be unplottable normally i want to draw a map of it while i can and ill be using the clima tact to make it rain plus
889710 they could be real monsters you sanji and usopp can deal with it
889711 i think usopp actually is allergic to the marimo he put on his head earlier
889712 they wont be if they step back on the island
889713 you two are the only hope for the gold i mean the leprechauns marimo sanji kun will do it for me wont you
889714 not now ive got to fulfill a princely mission for nami san
889715 i only know they be lurking in me field ill drop ye to the last place they took me marimo the king will know where to go he be nakama with the marimo it be on his head and his head will know where to find the monsters instinctively
889716 for the first month on sunny you had to ask where the bathroom was every day
889717 you needed someone to walk you to the kitchen and you stumbled to bed hours after your watch ended because youd been checking the perimeters
889718 why were you always up to notice when i got back from watch late
889719 i be entrusting the island to the marimo king and his slave now
889720 you were the one who made me fall over shithead you can pay for a new one at the next island we land on with shops
889721 typical that youd be king of such a shitty island marimo
889722 i was the only one to recognise marimo growing on your head in place of hair so i must have sent word ahead to a cult of leprechauns on an unplottable island that you were their marimo king my evil plan worked i am victorious
889723 yeah that solves everything i thought you only wore that if you were serious
889724 hm lets get this over with and hunt them then
889725 lets split up i dont want to deal with you
889726 me neither but if you head into this maze alone youre never going to find your way out
889727 i said wed better stick together or youll get lost
889728 way out here with everyone back at the ship theres no one to save you
889729 are you telling me you love every creepy crawly out there
889730 im a real man who doesnt get bothered by it
889731 i could cut through all this in a second and wed find something
889732 except this is precious stuff marimo head were supposed to be protecting it not slicing it into smithereens
889733 well fight when we find the thieves like the leprechaun said
889734 what would you have been if you werent a swordsman
889735 id rather find all blue though nothings supposed to stop our dreams right
889736 you just do what you want without saying a word to anyone else
889737 i didnt even know you were conscious until id already made the offer
889738 im going to have to knock some sense into you
889739 youre either too stupid to understand or too afraid to talk about it
889740 no youre going to shut up and listen for once
889741 after all is said and done do you know what a martyr is
889742 i used to think you have to be prepared to die for your dream that guy though he lives for it its never about death i didnt do it for that
889743 if brooke were here i think he might have a joke about that
889744 but then youre a lot weaker than me i could take more in my little finger than your whole lanky ass could handle
889745 would you like to feel my weak ass kick between your legs while youre stuck there
889746 this is still all your fault for inventing that name
889747 too much youve exerted too much you were already on your last legs aniki
889748 oh were sorry aniki we took advantage of your private moment to attack because we thought you were vicious gay pirates
889749 but we got found on the last one and made to walk the plank we managed to swim until we found this weird island but yosaku got sick again since we got here
889750 no hes got the skivvies is your girl aniki on that ship we saw docked
889751 they were with you guys when i left baratie and helped with village
889752 i thought they were like the girls bushes on your ship that healed yosaku last time
889753 ive been hacking through them but so far we havent found one orange
889754 did you say you saw the ship weve got oranges on there
889755 the leprechaun ossan is a musician hey we need a musician want to join our crew
889756 i be so glad to see the marimo king follows our traditional love of drink i tink ye mustve been a leprechaun in a previous life
889757 i remember well the time young zoro was flicking through his family tree tracing the twisting branches back into an ancient time of tunics tights and
889758 the marimo king will stay here forever and watch over his crop
889759 forgive me for getting skivvies again and trying to attack you
889760 aniki would collect just enough bounty as he went along to scrape food from bars
889761 and such brilliant ideas as hacking into marimo for oranges what a fine example
889762 ah but we didnt know aniki was the marimo king
889763 its offensive to the plants dont you know the hair isnt real marimo
889764 it just be hair very convincing soft hair like marimo but still just hair
889765 we still made it rain and caught johnny and yosaku for him
889766 but you know now we know this field is full of marimo we could make the most of it its a natural treasure we could probably sell it as good luck charms for a pretty sum
889767 and most of us are allergic or weakened by it it would be bad to take with us
889768 i wonder miss navigator perhaps something that resembled the plant would still sell for a price
889769 we dont have any marimo and its not as if stuff like it grows anywh
889770 its dark this far away from the fire keep your head still or ill slice it off
889771 you know i think this stuff must bring good luck marimo head
889772 but certainly were pleased to do it at the number we did it took a long time to get done but were glad we could avoid it arbitration
889773 i m happy ottawa is where i want to play hockey and i love the city
889774 i love the fan base and the support we have there we have a good team and i have some good friends as well
889775 he has the potential to be more i think in the next two years youll see better offensive production from him
889776 i have a chance there to see what my role will be in the next two years and go from there
889777 theres nothing new on meszaros i guess everyone has a feeling on the money they want
889778 at this point were not close to getting anything done
889779 the prosecution is sending a warning that while some things might be tolerated in sports other actions wont be tolerated
889780 but the crown is saying this level of violence is considered reprehensible and prohibited on or off the ice and there are norms that shouldnt be surpassed
889781 im getting ready for next season and if i have to testify ill go testify
889782 akhirnya saya ke kebon nanas ngurus sim terus ke daan mogot ngurus sim
889783 the hiv aids scenario in assam particularly the level of awareness among the people has undergone a sea change from august 1990 when the first aids case was reported
889784 makintosh type dresses for fear that they would contract the virus by going near him
889785 those were the days when awareness about hiv aids was low even among the medical fraternity not to speak of the common people
889786 obstetricians at gmch are even performing cesarean sections of hiv positive mothers
889787 death stares at them but they live with the aid of therapies made available by agencies like national aids control organisation naco and its key agency in the state the assam state aids control society asacs
889788 i made 5 000 last week after using this video each day a

889790 rene was set to start and was all changed but then complained of having a migraine we put him as sub and gave him a bit of something to eat to see if it would make him feel better but he was then violently sick so he couldnt be involved in the end

889793 adm has cost the american economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period at least 43 percent of adms annual profits are from products heavily subsidized or protected by the american government moreover every 1 of profits earned by adms corn sweetener operation costs consumers 10 and every 1 of profits earned by its ethanol operation costs taxpayers 30

889800 the number of devotees is somewhat down but the pilgrimage is on and the devouts are going to pay their obeisance at the temple the number may be reduced because of the stampede and also due to the overcast sky and possibility of heavy rain
889801 the pilgrims have been asked to stick to their queue in an orderly manner and not get influenced by rumours police personnel homeguards and volunteers are ensuring that the devotees keep to their row
889802 oooh you got the x13750 version 3 hows the infrared transfer rate on that doombangle

889804 this is a satire we are making fun of all the rumors
889805 there are times when the best deals are those that arent done
889806 were very concerned that a lot of people it would appear have been taken in by a very professional scam and theres a lot of money that appears to have gone under
889807 well collect as much information as possible for the accc the australian competition and consumer commission as well as international law enforcement agencies
889808 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate find substitute tickets or whatever
889809 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
889810 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
889811 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
889812 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
889813 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
889814 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
889815 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
889816 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
889817 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
889818 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
889819 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
889820 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
889821 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor
889822 despite that knowledge the state government saw fit to throw caution to the wind and the residents of collingwood park are now paying the price in the form of financial burden and psychological hardship as well
889823 its just stopped all the plans that i had to look after my parents
889824 im angry i have to fight back ive just got nowhere else to go with it
889825 weve now got a house thats worthless and impossible to sell
889826 weve really got no option but to pursue the government for the losses for something thats not our fault
889827 they are entitled to take whatever legal action is open to them and we will certainly be looking at it carefully and working with their lawyers to ensure that any obligations the queensland government has are fully met
889828 oh my wife shes always complaining about one thing or another

889832 carriers do not find nagpur a profitable destination there is continuous reduction in flights every week
889833 we now have international flights for only sharjah and dubai
889834 airlines are also filing requests to cancel some of their uneconomical flights or reduce the frequency in wake of the rising prices of aviation fuel and operational costs
889835 so far none of the airlines has cancelled flights from bhopal we only operate 10 flights a day which is really very low for a big state like madhya pradesh
889836 some observers are blaming the drop in profit on slumping revenues but revenues were 3 78 billion down only 1 4 percent from a year ago and the company has continued with cost cutting measures as the economy underperforms the real reason for the slump in profits is that sun has faced heavy competition from ibm and hewlett packard in the high margin server market still sun maintains that its many open source initiatives will lead it toward brighter days
889837 oh wow look at the stars theyre yours for the taking

889841 i was at the oneness meditation camp in chittoor district i had undertaken a maun vrat till the end of this week i did a spiritual course there and returned to mumbai on sunday
889842 the place was so beautiful and calm though its hard for me to keep quiet for more than 10 minutes i found it easy to remain quiet when nature seems to second my tranquil emotion
889843 its a fabulous mind and body healing course when i met the spiritual leader at the oneness university i could feel his divine energy flow from him into me i know it sounds like mumbo jumbo youve to experience it to know how it feels
889844 there are not many acquisition targets currently in india but we may look at the potential opportunities in the internet space that are aligned to our business model if valuations correct
889845 we had been approached as potential takeover target prior to going public but we have always made it clear that the company is not for sale and moreover there have been no approaches ever since the companys listing
889846 but if something interesting comes up we would take a call at that point of time
889847 acquisition is not in our mind right now but if at all we may look at acquisition in the internet platform
889848 while naukri com has witnessed a growth rate of about 56 percent other business activities non naukri has been growing at a higher pace at about 70 to 80 percent
889849 if he rode past on his bike if he saw me working in the garden he would stop and say hi

889851 i didnt want to try to run away who knows what he would have done if i did
889852 its iran again the iranian issue remains fluid and it looks like more sanctions will be imposed by the world powers and they will likely raise tensions over iran
889853 some reports are saying much of the us offshore oil production facilities are in the likely path of the storm but it is a little too early to say what the direction of the storm is going to be
889854 we were watching that how the market is responding to the rate hikes by some of the leading banks given the pressure on the margins the bank might revise its bplr very soon
889855 we direct that the saarc food bank be urgently operationalised we also emphasise early drawing up of the saarc agriculture perspective 2020
889856 no we cannot will not change this is the way it is and tough titty on you if you dont like it
889857 as usual the idealists are 100 right in principle and as usual the pragmatists are right in practice the flames will continue for years this debate precisely splits the world in two if you have a way to buy stock in internet flame wars now would be a good time to do that
889858 tell em what youre going to tell em then tell em then tell em what you told em
889859 third trial begins monday in mineola swingers club child sex ring case
889860 hes always saying if you play low and play fast you can create a lot of plays
889861 you tell yourself its going to happen this play you tell yourself that youre going to create this play sometimes what you have to do is play the play in your mind before it happens
889862 last year it was a matter of getting back there and just hoping that things fall your way now its more of taking it upon yourself to create those opportunities for yourself and for your teammates thats what im focusing on not just hoping for turnovers but creating them
889863 patrick willis today is not the patrick willis of last year
889864 a year ago he was just a garden gnome in a field if you told him to stand there he did very robotic
889865 the events of august 16 1908 are regarded as an important milestone in the evolution of passive resistance as a form of protest against racial discrimination and apartheid and will be commemorated in several ways
889866 the centerpiece of these commemorative events is of course the march but the indian consulate has also brought in a wide range of community civil society and other organizations because mahatma gandhis message of non violence and passive resistance against injustice remains as relevant today as it was in 1908 the recent incidents of xenophobic violence in johannesburg cape town and other areas make it especially poignant
889867 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
889868 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married

889871 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
889872 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
889873 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
889874 theres a big difference between five games up and one up
889875 we had a chance to be three up today its a huge difference at the same time i believe that with the way were playing right now the way were playing defense hitting and pitching were going to be all right
889876 it will be tight all the way down i think
889877 its not the worst thing in the world to split here
889878 we did have a successful road trip but its a little disappointing after winning the first two that we couldnt pull one out in the last two games
889879 you put manny in any lineup and theyre going to be more difficult
889880 he probably is the best hitter in baseball right now
889881 but if i take you id have to take the eight others too
889882 but gramma im not just your grandchild im also gonna be your

889884 a cut down version with the candy bar shape of ipod nano music players would be a huge hit as a christmas gift
889885 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
889886 this ones rock and this ones a ballad and this ones kind of hip hop
889887 this ones a traditional folk song this ones a ridiculously hard electrodancehall slammer this is a poem and this ones an all noise freakout
889888 que a simple vista i en plena nit va determinar que superaven els 400
889889 i dont think there is anyone on our team who has the physical skills he has
889890 hes strong as an ox he has a low center of gravity hes fast hes got it all
889891 understand that we have a chip on our shoulders we all understand whats at stake were all going to go extremely hard im really excited for our defensive line right now
889892 hes a big strong fast athlete hes a very explosive player hes learning how to use his hands better to become a more dominant player inside hes far and away our fastest interior defensive lineman
889893 i came in here with a huge amount of pride on offense
889894 everything i did i took it very seriously of course ill miss it but at the same time im glad i get to do this for my teammates and i get to show i can go out and play even harder
889895 when i first started this spring i wasnt used to the finesse of being a pass rusher
889896 the offensive line made a lot of jokes when i would just come off the line and try to bull rush somebody i learned quick it was a different kind of game and they were the first ones to tell me that maybe i could learn some moves
889897 sure we lost four starters but i look at the production of those four starters
889898 can we replace or get better production out of our front four
889899 it wont really sink in until i get my first sack
889900 if were not getting what we need out of our backup tight end thats a distinct possibility
889901 this years team wasnt as talented as last years team so to get this close for them to do this well they overachieved theres some great satisfaction that comes with that
889902 this team they did the little things the sacrifice bunts knowing the situations playing it right
889903 we are going to see what he can do there
889904 we feel we have made some good additions at running back and we wanted to see if we can give glyndon a chance to get on the field more
889905 he did it in the spring and did it very well
889906 if an urban family of four makes less than four millions rials a460 a month then the family is under the poverty line
889907 ini tidak akan menghasilkan jagad raya yang menguntungkan karena nantinya tidak akan ada cukup banyak waktu untuk evolusi menuju kehidupan kompleks
889908 lagipula objek objek sebesar kita manusia akan dihancurkan oleh kekuatan gravitasi
889909 peter carey has no right to steal my fabricated identity from me its all ive got
889910 in that situation most of the pitchers dont throw me inside but sliders away if he would have hit me with the first pitch i would have went to first base but three times were inside it seemed so obvious to me i just do what i needed to do
889911 all along i knew it was there to start with
889912 hopefully i can just keep improving each year and keep getting better and better as a player thats what you strive for
889913 you look at all the home run guys the power they have is phenomenal
889914 when i hit one i hit one good like manny ramirez can get jammed and as a power hitter he might hit it out where for me it would be a pop fly with guys like me you have to hit it well to hit it out
889915 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
889916 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
889917 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
889918 but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
889919 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina
889920 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
889921 its amazing that just a couple of weeks ago it was all doom and gloom its nice to be back in the winners circle
889922 weve given ourselves a chance and were back amongst it
889923 the beauty of it is that we hold the cards for our own destiny as a footy club this year and thats how you want it to be
889924 you dont want to be relying on other teams to do things for you youve got to do it yourself
889925 thats probably the best weve done for awhile in terms of having everybody contributing
889926 porps goes down and someone else steps up so its all about picking up the rope and everybody just contributing their bit to our overall performance
889927 its something we really look forward to its another chance for us to play on our home deck and in front of our own supporters so well be fired up as well
889928 our destiny is in our own hands so its up to us to put the right performance together
889929 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
889930 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200 metres
889931 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
889932 to finish on the podium in finland is fantastic its one of those rallies that you really really want to do well on and its great to add it to the cv
889933 i really want to thank everybody in the team its just really cool to be here on the podium the first time in finland with the new car and of course its great to be back in third in the championship
889934 we used greece and turkey as part of extended test program so this is the first event in which weve really focussed on our performance on gravel
889935 its been our first chance to really see how the car performs on gravel and how the work done in testing translates to a rally and it is clear weve made good progress
889936 chris did a great job and we learned a lot that we will take into new zealand later this month in particular as the next gravel rally as we continue the steep part of the learning curve that we are currently in
889937 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
889938 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
889939 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
889940 eh bien cest tout b te cest parce que cest un carnet des shinigami dieux de la mort en jap
889941 well there comes time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
889942 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
889943 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
889944 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
889945 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
889946 but the combination of internal politics and media generalisation created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
889947 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
889948 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning
889949 hes very talented and an exceptionally level headed young kid
889950 hes done very good at school since bbc brought him down from mackay
889951 ive had offers from rugby and league but im not sure what im going to do
889952 im going to finish the rugby season and make a decision then
889953 hes a lovely good quality kid and bbc deserve a big rap for what theyve done for him
889954 in order to convince them to allow the refugees entry
889955 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
889956 will be investigated and if found to be guilty they will be brought to justice
889957 following meetings held throughout the day by the israel defence forces army and the security establishment the idf is preparing to transfer the rescued fatah operatives to the ramallah area
889958 israel and the idf both of whom operate according to humanitarian values in order to save lives took action both on sunday and again today monday when a danger to the mens lives became apparent
889959 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
889960 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
889961 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
889962 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
889963 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
889964 its marvellous that the afl and the mcc melbourne cricket club have got together in this way because as we know they were parted
889965 this the mcg is the home of football melbourne is the biggest city in australia for sport so to me its an absolute natural fit
889966 so many things have gone on here with cricket the american army staying here during the second world war the olympics it just goes on and on the history of this area
889967 for football to be part of it to me is very natural
889968 in order to convince them to allow the refugees entry
889969 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
889970 israel and the israel defence forces army both of whom operate according to humanitarian values in order to save lives took action both on sunday and again today when a danger to the mens lives became apparent
889971 we agree with the legal reasoning set out by the reliable majority
889972 though we embrace the fifth circuits decision we are unfortunately constrained from following it
889973 fifth circuit precedent is not binding on texas courts and its constitutional pronouncements are highly persuasive at best
889974 an explanation for why texas courts and other state courts are not bound by the constitutional pronouncements of the federal district and circuit courts can be found in united states ex rel lawrence v woods
889975 while lawrences appeal was pending before the supreme court of illinois a federal district court in an unrelated declaratory judgment action held that the interference ordinance was unconstitutional and void on its face as repugnant to the federal constitution
889976 the supreme court of illinois later affirmed lawrences conviction and lawrence eventually appealed to the seventh circuit of which illinois is a part contending that the supreme court of illinois failed to follow under the supremacy clause the federal district courts ruling
889977 this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding
889978 i n the absence of a controlling decision by the united states supreme court texas courts of civil appeals are bound by the pronouncements of the texas supreme court on the law after a principle rule or proposition of law has been squarely decided by the texas supreme court the decision is accepted as a binding precedent by the same court or other courts of lower rank when the very point is again presented in a subsequent suit between different parties and until the supreme court states to the contrary its pronouncement is the law on an expressed issue
889979 of course in a given factual setting when a lower federal court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties its adjudication is the law of the case and its judgment is binding on all other courts subject only to the appellate process
889980 but that is not the situation here the district courts declaration that the interference ordinance is unconstitutional was made in an unrelated case and at a time when petitioners appeal from his conviction was pending in the supreme court of illinois in these circumstances we hold that the federal courts ruling was not binding on the state appellate tribunal just as state courts are not bound by declaratory judgments a lower federal courts issuance of an injunction as done by the fifth circuit in reliable also fails to directly bind state courts
889981 the interesting thing is its all about the law of the case between the parties and one of the defendants in our case was the state of texas they intervened in our action so they cant do anything to our clients because in our case theyre bound
889982 so at least at the moment you can say if anybody wants to buy retail any and all devices they can go to any store owned by reliable and they have several in austin one in kennedale and i think they have one or two in san antonio or they could buy it mail order through adam amp eve
889983 of the dissenting arguments the most compelling is the last one the little short one
889984 she says this decision overrules red bluff and that therefore only an en banc court can do that the rules in every circuit are one three judge panel cant overrule another the counter argument is if theres an intervening supreme court decision that would trump the earlier decision and red bluff was 81
889985 it red bluff was a challenge to a whole string of things because it involved a big obscenity bill
889986 it amended the obscenity laws it added this thing obscene devices and did some other things so there were a lot of issues in it this was a comparatively minor issue in the case and there wasnt much of an evidentiary record which im pretty sure there was in reliable consultants and i know in williams see below there was a terrific evidentiary record the only evidence in red bluff that had anything to do with this is they had some guy who was a paraplegic and he said he needed these kinds of things that were illegal under this law to function sexually that was about it the trial court upheld it the fifth circuit affirmed and it went no further
889987 the highest probability of getting cert granted in the supreme court is when there is an unambiguous split in the circuits
889988 and there couldnt be a plainer split than this one its not a rule or anything like that circuits will look to each other if theres no opinion in the circuit youre in the first thing theyre interested in knowing is well have any other circuits decided this issue and if six of them have ruled on it and theyve all gone the same way if youre on the other side youre pretty doomed
889989 every state that has one of these obscene device laws is either in the tenth circuit the fifth circuit or the eleventh circuit and a few of them have popped up in local government where cities or counties passed them
889990 but by and large the state laws are just in those places and the fifth circuit and the eleventh circuit have now ruled on it in colorado it was held unconstitutional by the colorado supreme court
889991 it is beyond dispute that the supreme court decided lawrence as a substantive due process case
889992 analyzing a case under substantive due process a court will apply one of two levels of scrutiny
889993 the lawrence court announced a narrow liberty interest protecting two adults who with full and mutual consent from each other engage in sexual practices in the confines of their homes nothing more indeed despite some broad rhetoric the lawrence court refrained from announcing a fundamental right under substantive due process analysis and stressed the limited scope of the case before it the present case does not involve minors it does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused it does not involve public conduct or prostitution it does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter the case does involve two adults who with full and mutual consent from each other engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle the reliable majority improperly broadened the scope of this narrow personal liberty interest to encompass commercial activity
889994 does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused
889995 involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter
889996 the liberty interest announced in lawrence protects only adult consensual private conduct
889997 the statute in reliable does not prohibit sexual conduct private or otherwise nor does it impermissibly burden any personal right it prohibits only commercial conduct e g manufacturing selling or advertising sexual devices including dildos and artificial vaginas which the people of texas acting through their elected representatives have deemed to be particularly immoral offensive or otherwise warranting commercial prohibition moreover the statute prohibits only commercial acts in the state of texas texans face no punishment should they choose to possess or use such devices nor do they face punishment for purchasing such devices in another state and bringing them into texas for their private use
889998 and if theres one right thats been consistent throughout the world for centuries its the right of people well hetero couples and singles to have sex with each other or just themselves in the privacy of their own homes hotel rooms etc emphasis added
889999 that it texas anti sodomy statute reflected the moral judgment of the legislature and thus the people
