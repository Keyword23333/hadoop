2630027 my faith has been enormous to me in my personal life and of course my personal life is a big impact on my political life i have had an interesting faith journey over the course of my life i was born and raised in the southern baptist church i was baptized in the southern baptist church and then later in life joined the methodist church and like a lot of people when i was in my college years and i went to law school and became a lawyer and was raising my young family i moved away somewhat from my faith and then i lost a son in 1996 and my faith came roaring back and it played an enormous role in my ability to get through that period it stayed with me and has been enormously important
2630028 count this as a successful marketing campaign by the republicans because theres no other way to explain how such an inoffensive middle of the road politician is perceived by so many as extremism incarnate

2630064 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2630065 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2630066 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2630067 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2630068 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2630069 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2630070 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2630071 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2630072 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2630073 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2630074 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2630075 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2630076 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2630077 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2630078 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

2630089 like a fine tea ive been steeped in the agency
2630090 we figured out that people with disabilities enjoy beading and having a job
2630091 we knew we could create meaningful employment that would give them a sense of pride and when people are doing something they like you dont have the behavioral issues
2630092 if you have one applicant who has a degree and one who has a disability who are you going to hire
2630093 we find what works best for each person but we also teach them valuable job skills
2630094 most special needs people are very sensory oriented so tactile work fits their strengths the act of sanding and feeling the texture of the wood is calming and gives an immediate sense of accomplishment
2630095 you want to set them up for success not failure
2630096 part of the process is addressing issues they may have in the work environment
2630097 people ask us all the time if they really do all the work and they really do
2630098 they know how to stay on task follow instructions and do all the hammering nailing sanding and staining
2630099 there are many employers that dont know the value of a special needs adult and how they can help them in their business
2630100 our students dont just learn about furniture and jewelry they learn how to be a good team player and develop social skills while gaining self confidence and life skills
2630101 its not just a job making jewelry and candles is really satisfying and quality work improves your quality of life

2630113 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2630114 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2630115 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2630116 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2630117 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market

2630139 its truly remarkable that unicef is still able to make a difference in the health education and overall well being of somali children
2630140 i honestly think season 2 runner up clay aiken has changed this competition forever its becoming incredibly personality led now

2630145 it seems like this guy has been focusing on more than just his music
2630146 here he makes a touching statement about the importance of education and the work unicef is doing
2630147 personally i believe that education is the key to our future and the key to solving our environmental problems so hooray for clay for bringing some celeb status to these issues

2630152 he would be a good boyfriend but hes not for me
2630153 he already puts up with so much from me i couldnt possibly ask him out
2630154 i e mailed kanaans assistant and told her we were coming to the kentucky race from indianapolis and asked if she could do me a favor
2630155 i asked if she would put the engagement ring in a glove so when tony gave it to her i would ask kerri to marry me
2630156 i thought maybe tk had lost his wedding ring in the finger of the glove
2630157 paul dana was a hero to so many as an irl driver a personality and an advocate for biofuels he made a difference and was an inspiration in a very short time indiana has become a national leader in the biofuels industry today we recognize the states corn and soybean farmers who have helped indiana achieve such success
2630158 i think the right front suspension broke because there was no reason i was just turning and the car went straight into the wall im very sure it was the suspension because the car went down and straight into the wall
2630159 what a day i think we tried to play it kind of safe and just be conservative even in traffic we really didnt rush things the car was fantastic we didnt have as much speed actually as we thought we did especially in practice and qualifying the car was super fast we had a couple of guys that definitely sped up with vitor meira and marco andretti toward the end their cars were very fast it was strategy in the end it was crazy there was no way we were going to catch him he was half the track ahead of us i knew our car was probably quicker than his but not 20 miles per hour faster it was nice to get it the way we did i think about the run that dario franchitti had for the championship last season and its nice to be able to be in that position after how we lost it last year
2630160 we took a chance i cant believe how close we were coming out of the last turn the fuel pressure went on and i started to lift i was just a few hundred yards short i have to thank tim cindric and team penske for the great strategy we did not have the car unfortunately so im extremely happy with second
2630161 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races scott dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
2630162 today was good i think we were actually a little light at the beginning of the race but we were ahead so that actually offset it everyone did a good job and we cant complain everyone wanted to win and we put ourselves into position to do that it was a good finish and this gives us momentum going into the next race and the rest of the season we gained points and we gained everything else so we are happy that we had an overall good day even though we would have liked to see the win
2630163 it was a very competitive race and i am really happy for scott dixon and all the guys at target chip ganassi i was having trouble finding speed and tony kanaan just wasnt going to let me have it easy but thats good racing i didnt seem to quite have enough it was a good race we lost a lot of spots in the pits on that last one and it is difficult to get them back it seemed i had it going pretty good in the draft but when i got outside i wasnt quite quick enough it was a competitive race and it seemed like we rode pretty well just a little bit short
2630164 the car was good i was able to race with them and was really quick in the corners we thought we had too much drag on the car because it was slower on the straightaway but then we lost power maybe something else was going on its really disappointing for everyone
2630165 it was a tough race for the mcdonalds team i was held up at the start by the guy in front of me manning he couldnt make his mind up on if he wanted to go on the green flag or if he wanted the bottom lane or the high lane i think i was about second to last by the time i came out of the back straight it was a frustrating start but then we just picked them off one by one and worked our way back up i saw that graham rahal got a great start and i was five or six places behind him i was feeling comfortable and was catching the pack but then i saw graham have his problem and i didnt know what had happened about 10 or 15 laps later i couldnt keep up with the pack i had caught and i was slowly dropping back i guess that was the first sign but i didnt realize it at the time i was hoping that everyone else had picked up some speed but we were actually getting slower eventually we were coming into the pits on the yellow and i was in turn 2 and downshifted from sixth to fifth and got neutral and couldnt get a gear after that and that was the end the team had to come get me at pit in and push me back to the pits to figure out what had gone wrong im obviously looking forward to the next road course race
2630166 to have this happen is unfortunate because we had a great car we went from 20 th to 12 th i think the car was really good and i was moving forward but we kept losing drive we keep shearing the teeth off of fifth gear for some reason and cant figure out why we had the problem and went behind the wall to try to fix it and got back out but lost fifth gear a second time we moved up so quickly and surprised ourselves i felt very racy its unfortunate but its all part of the learning process on the other ovals i felt i was overly caution so this time i thought well ive got to go for it i was going around the outside of oriol servia when i started having problems later on the restart i got by a couple of cars and felt pretty good about how the race was going but unfortunately it didnt last
2630167 all in all we were 11th there on the last lap and had a right rear bearing failure it started vibrating and slowing down i was just hoping that it would make it to the end but it didnt at least we kept it out of the fence and came home it was a good showing for sarah fisher racing we had a really good race and a really good race car tonight its definitely something to take to chicago to run with these boys
2630168 i think we had a lot of teamwork we enjoyed a consistent pace and no mistakes maybe one of the yellow flags didnt help us because it came just after we had pitted other than that we are progressing every race hopefully at chicago we are going to be in a stronger position again i am also looking forward to racing at infineon and australia
2630169 we thought we had a better car than 12 th for the race but despite being very well balanced we just didnt have the speed kv racing technology had a tough break coming out of pit lane on the first pit stop when milka duno spun at pit out right in front of me i had to stop which cost me track position and eventually we lost a lap we tried to get the lap back but the yellows didnt come our way it was just one of those days but we got the car home and got some points it was just not the result we were hoping for the next two races are on road and street races which is more our ground so i am looking forward to that
2630170 it was a disappointing race for kvrt aussie vineyards team australia four laps into the race we had a mechanical failure which sent me into the wall and then i was unable to drive the car i want to thank the kv racing team once again we are the top transition team we have great cars but at the moment i am just having a really bad run of luck hopefully at the next race on the road circuit in sonoma we will have a better weekend
2630171 it was a tough race we made some changes throughout the race to make the car better but i think the main thing was that i was a little too unstable in traffic which cost us a little bit in the end we finished the race which is always our first goal but i really thought i could do better having tested here in an indycar series car before still this weekend was a really good experience the team did a good job and this will definitely give us momentum as we move forward
2630172 i had some fun at the beginning of the race passing people and fighting with other cars past the halfway point of the race i got a puncture and had to slow down a little bit before pitting for new tires when i came back out of the pits after that i was in front of the leaders so i slowed to let them by and then i was told to come back to the pits i dont know why race control parked me next time i wont slow down for the leaders i will just do my race i had just done my pit four laps before that and i let the leaders by with no problem and i got parked so i dont understand this
2630173 considering the fact that we started from the very back of the field im happy with an 11 th place finish it was difficult getting through traffic at the start of the race but that is what i expected all in all the motorola car did very well i have to thank my crew for getting the back up car ready in such a short amount of time they did an awesome job
2630174 it was fun clean racing out there tonight i raced hard with hideki mutoh and tk tony kanaan dan wheldon and ryan hunter reay i should be happier with a sixth place finish than i am but we came here really wanting to get on the podium or battle for a win it was a good day and we made up some ground on points a couple of the other cars were a little quicker than me late in the race we may have had a little too much downforce in the car late in the race when the track was in the shadows but the menards car was a really good car tonight its a good finish to get on an oval and score some points how well just head go to sonoma and detroit and figure out how to do the same
2630175 i lost sixth gear half way through the race but kept hoping for the best coming out of the pits on our last stop i just couldnt get it to upshift the vision crew took the no 2 lilly car behind the wall and worked really hard trying to get her fixed but it just didnt happen for us not sure if it was gearbox or electronics well take a look at it at the shop to see what the problem was exactly im just really disappointed for the team and the lilly folks that joined us at this race we had hoped for a much better result than this
2630176 team penske did a great job today we had a solid consistent run and the car was handling very well it was definitely fun out there there was a lot of side by side racing and it really was quite exciting i think we had a solid car we just didnt quite have to speed to run in the top three or four we wouldve liked a bit higher finish but the important thing is we earned some valuable points out there and maintain our fifth place standing in the championship
2630177 this was a difficult night for us especially in the early stages of the race my guys worked hard throughout the race to make the team 7 eleven car better and we were able to get more and more competitive as the night went on obviously an eighth place finish was not what we were looking for though
2630178 i am not exactly sure what happened i went into the corner and the car snapped around at me unfortunately i think cr crews was in the wrong place at the wrong time but he did cushion my blow against the wall
2630179 it looked like christina lost the car and collected me in the process
2630180 i knew it was going to be hard to pass on this track i have to admit raphael matos has been really strong in qualifying and practice throughout the weekend i knew there was a chance at getting him at the start and luckily i pulled that off and was able to hang on i dont know why he wasnt behind me maybe something happened but i dont know the story yet i still had to fight off some really strong competition luckily we were strong enough to hang on to the lead
2630181 i think we definitely deserved to be up there weve been strong on ovals lately a strong oval finish has been important to me and that hasnt been something ive been able to do so far this season for one reason or the other i just want to thank sam schmidt motorsports lifelock my fellow australian engineer ive been working with this weekend tim neff i could have maybe taken a bit of a chance by jumping dillon battistini on the restart but i didnt want to end up losing a position so we held on to a safe second
2630182 it was a great race all of our cars are strong in the front i think it just came down to track position dillon battistini got a great start he snuck up on me on the inside i didnt expect him to be there and he got the lead and it was hard to get around him after that its a third podium in a row on ovals for me so i feel pretty good we just need to get the first place hopefully that comes at infineon or chicago
2630183 i didnt think about it too much until the yellows and it started aching a little bit but it feels good it feels good getting third so for a few hours its not going to really matter
2630184 a top four its very good im thankful to the whole team sam schmidt lucas oil lifelock it was just awesome the car felt so good i could go inside outside once you get to the front its tougher to pass on the long runs i had the best car by far its just that james davison and dillon battistini made it hard to get around them with two cars it was a two lane race i was trying to help james i almost got both of them at one point i tried to pass davison on the outside with three laps to go going into turn 1 and arie luyendyk got underneath me he had the slip stream on me and i got boxed to the outside still im excited about the finish
2630185 weve still got the points lead were first its awesome well just go to sonoma and look to build on our points lead there i had a lot of success on that track last year and i think it will be a good venue for me
2630186 its no fun starting at the back i feel like if i didnt use my stuff up coming through the field i probably would have had a shot at the podium and probably would have battled my teammate for the win the car was awesome i just ran out of time those cautions killed me we had a really really good setup on the car it was really fast i just like making it hard on myself at the start i dont know what happened it didnt start so we had to come back up through the field and theyre like everyone knows youre coming through and the 22 car just swerved right in front of me it was either hit him in the side or spin out so i spun out and they made me go to the back i dont really agree with that its also drivers not listening to their spotters and letting them know that were coming up through the field its just a tough deal but a top five finish isnt bad i guess im happy
2630187 it was a little bit frustrating but i was expecting it because my car lost positions on the start the yellow flags kind of made us struggle a little bit and my car wasnt good on the restarts my car came back to me at the end of the race and i was able to gain a little bit of ground and i was able to attack but i just ran out of time but the important thing is with this race i was able to gain some good points i finished sixth and antinucci finished fourth the good thing is that i am only four points behind and there are still plenty of races and we can improve and are real quick on the road courses and we are still in the fight for the championship i feel great about going into the next couple of races we have been doing good everywhere and on the road courses so chicago should be good for us as well
2630188 the car was loose and i was fighting it i got my wheel on brent shermans line and the car got looser
2630189 getting children back to school is vital for their protection and helps build a sense of normalcy in their lives
2630190 the re establishment of schools in the most difficult circumstances is a testament to the commitment of unicef and to kenyans
2630191 every child has the right to an education education transforms lives and breaks the cycle of poverty that so many children are caught in and an educated child will make sure his or her own children receive an education too
2630192 kim chang bae cameraman participated 3 olympics 15 gold 25 silver 15 bronze
2630193 with such a high visibility trip with so many countries covered and so many press people covering the trip the number of staff is not out of line
2630194 ive seen you at like the mtv video music awards and i think last year i remember sitting there when like you know nsync or britney spears was on and i remember just looking over at you and just thinking like what does david bowie think of this right now
2630195 its too easy isnt it laughter let me go another way with that one i think you know a major band in this country for me anyway during the 80s were the pixies i thought they were absolutely necessary a very very important band charles was or frank whatever however you want to refer to him is a fantastic songwriter and they produce some really exciting music obviously nirvana was terribly influenced by them a number of other bands were influenced by them but they were never played on american radio they never sold any albums and they broke up and im seeing that beginning to happen again over here youve got bands like granddaddy mercury rev flaming lips are getting some kind of exposure now right this second but they dont get played they dont sell albums and if youre not careful theyre gonna go under and more creative really inventive artists are gonna disappear after two or three years cause nobodys out there supporting them radio isnt supporting them like it should be and there is crap on american radio
2630196 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2630197 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2630198 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2630199 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2630200 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2630201 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2630202 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2630203 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2630204 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2630205 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2630206 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2630207 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2630208 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2630244 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2630245 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2630246 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2630247 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2630248 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2630249 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving

2630254 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2630255 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2630256 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important

2630264 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2630265 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2630266 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2630267 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call

2630283 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2630284 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2630285 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2630286 levi was gonna curb dwelling place mete afterwards he said dad mom i wanna go support moms purses
2630287 at 30 days aged hes talking well nigh fill full like that
2630288 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2630289 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2630290 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2630291 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2630292 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2630295 mukwazhi informed misa zimbabwe before he left the country that some plainclothes police officers had come to his house on 29 july around 0530hrs broke down the main door and beat him up and the maid before taking him to the southerton police station where he was released after a couple of hours without charge
2630296 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2630297 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2630298 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2630299 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2630300 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2630301 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
2630302 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
2630303 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
2630304 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2630305 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2630306 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2630307 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2630308 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2630309 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
2630310 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump yeah 10 years from now 2 cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
2630311 they were the sweetest family ever they are a really christian family
2630312 they follow usa volleyball they would leave little messages for the players the whole reason they were here is because their life is usa volleyball
2630313 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2630314 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2630315 its raised expectations that it wont deliver on its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2630316 its always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results onto federal results
2630317 we are grateful also for the generosity and support of many other public charities private foundations and individual donors
2630318 you cant be against the war and for the war budget

2630324 she tried to live her life well and extend that goodness to everybody else and sometimes bad things happen to good people and thats unfortunate
2630325 there are a lot of kids here right now that she would take in feed let them use her computer and just make sure everybody was safe in the neighborhood
2630326 even though we really want to know what happened were not pressing the police for answers because we know well find out eventually and hopefully when we find out theyll have that person arrested
2630327 honey everything of mine but my wife and kids is for sale

2630336 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2630337 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2630338 one consequence of this is people under 40 have no memory of the old trade unions and hence no particular reason to dislike them but the culture of hatred of the unions has lingered on in the liberal party and has underlain the howard governments re election strategy to the extent that it has one
2630339 dear adam i read your essay today with great interest and i think it is a very good essay
2630340 if the economy is going so well why am i struggling to pay the credit card mortgage bills
2630341 simple liberal is for the rich bastards labor is for everybody else
2630342 the good folk of mosman will vote for an ashtray so long as it was the endorsed liberal candidate
2630343 we cannot know if an election held at that time would or would not have produced a result like that merely that the poll results correctly broken down gives a certain number of seats your experience made you wary and you assumed a narrowing which of course turned out to be correct but this doesnt make possum wrong as he wasnt making a final election result prediction merely interpreting what the poll result would look like in terms of seats
2630344 no we cannot know but i am absolutely certain that if the election had been held in august or september when those polls were taken labor would not have won 112 seats or anything like it polls must be interpreted not treated as holy writ
2630345 im not sure what the purpose of this exercise is when it so obviously defies commonsense and the observations of everyone in the political process
2630346 there is an average 11 6 swing against the government in its safe seats for that to be wrong thousands of people would have had to be telling lies to newspoll over a 9 month period which i simply do not believe
2630347 for every safe government seat that swings less than the average amount others in the same category will swing more
2630348 a list of seats which a literal interpretation of newspoll would suggest will fall to labor but which i along with all other sensible people know will not
2630349 can you put up the list of seats that you used to get your final result
2630350 there are seven seats with liberal majorities of under 2 these are kingston bonner wakefield makin braddon parramatta and hasluck im confident the liberals will lose all seven
2630351 nothing really matters anyone can see nothing really matters nothing really matters to me any way the wind blows
2630352 its too late everybody ive got to go got to leave you all behind and face the truth mama i dont want to die but i sometimes wish id never been born at all
2630353 and a lead in western australia are the only bright spots for the coalition
2630354 and we wish the rest of the country would follow their heart
2630355 while the alp is still in front of the coalition in key marginal electorates the gap is much narrower than national polling indicates
2630356 this latest newspoll in the most marginal seats shows the swing in these seats 7per cent since the last election is virtually identical to the 6 8 per cent national swing measured in last weekends newspoll
2630357 the only certainty in this years senate election is that the democrats will lose their four seats

2630369 theres a couple guys that im very surprised they didnt go
2630370 if you could go back a couple years and you go through the whole season playing man coverage and you only give up one touchdown and you dont go you know what i mean
2630371 politics may have something to do with it and factor in it may not but it all worked out
2630372 there are a couple guys that should go they should have been over there with us
2630373 definitely wood my best crime partner nick barnett played great both of those guys probably the two best players on our defense right now i think they should have got the honor
2630374 please let me win but if i can not win let me be brave in the attempt
2630375 i havent felt this way in a long time actually i never felt this way at all
2630376 yes there were like we had to make the solar system i remember when i had to do that that was like killer
2630377 the message is school schooling and everything goes back to school no matter what you do
2630378 that being good in school helps you with everything that you try to do
2630379 its always important for when youve been blessed in any kind of way to give back to the community to show that you appreciate where you come from maybe one of these kids today gets something out of it thats good
2630380 mikes keeping us humble weve got a lot of young guys who are completely playing their expletive off if we dont get too cocky well be good
2630381 them being able to get a slight jam on the receiver is the difference between us being able to get there
2630382 that fraction of a second can be the difference between a sack and a completion
2630383 but sometimes i will still get a guy and push him and hell fall on the ground and hell look back up like hey damn how did that happen
2630384 if anyone can play press man up in your face like a deion sanders type that can shut the whole field down its al harris

2630386 theres a couple guys that are strong like t o the guy from san diego is strong arizona anquan boldin hes strong but once i touch em i can pretty much guide them to where i want to go
2630387 theyll be a little aggressive i know what to expect
2630388 its really hard in our scheme because our back is always to the quarterback
2630389 i learn the guy learn the system pick my spots where i may be able to make an interception cause a turnover study and then just trust what i know
2630390 actually were putting more emphasis on getting turnovers with this defense than defenses that ive played on in the past
2630391 its cool i like it when i first heard about it i was blown out i was like yeah
2630392 its important because i never went shopping for nobody all the years now this is my first time going shopping for everybody
2630393 myself and i might get a couple gifts for my mom and my granny
2630394 if they do the right thing then youll be rewarded
2630395 im real excited because its a blessing for all this stuff and i want to thank him a lot
2630396 when we watch tape of a guy we have to watch tape of the raiders or the old dolphins because its hard to find a tape on guys receivers getting pressed theyre getting free releases all day
2630397 when we go into a game after a few plays or two or three series some guys are like are you going to do this all day
2630398 the risk factor is if you dont get a jam on randy moss or any good receiver its six points
2630399 you have to be sound in your technique i think thats probably why teams shy away from press coverage the margin for error is small
2630400 i remember eagles coach andy reid was so mad at me he used to send me to anger management classes
2630401 we were playing chicago in a playoff game in 2001 and i got a 15 yard penalty for slapping david terrell we could have lost the game i was a hothead andy was so mad
2630402 now i take it out but its right at the play
2630403 that was not a good spot but usually guys dont fall for that anymore thats an old trick
2630404 the next play i told him how did you fall for that he wasnt looking at me which i really thought was disrespectful most guys who line up in front of me are at attention he was looking all at the safeties i was like cmon
2630405 i am but the renuer and reviver of an ancient old copies printed here in london the 14 of august 1543 collected published made and set forth by one hugh oldcastle schoolmaster who as reappeared by his treatise then taught arithmetics and this booke in saint ollaves parish in

2630445 what hra does is take projects the private sector wont take on
2630446 whatever the reason is thats really our role to try to make improvements to the city
2630447 it really added difficulty to a project such as that things that were almost automatic with my business scheduling work and finding work and budgeting and getting paid were no longer automatic i was chasing money and finding work that distracted the focus from 302 fremont to kind of an ancillary collateral issue
2630448 we used to joke that the house was held up by hope
2630449 it was no one thing that happened it was a horrible series of events nailed down by the failure of the housing market
2630450 the end result is that the neighborhood is better off because regardless of who gets it or how much weve lost its a pretty fair looking house now and the neighborhood is going to come out ahead
2630451 but a whole years worth of hra money given to one project thats a bad idea i would rather have seen 10 20 000 projects than one 200 000 project

2630467 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2630468 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2630469 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2630470 john mccain was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine

2630472 its not god at work here in all this squalor and suffering

2630474 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2630475 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2630476 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2630477 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2630478 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market

2630533 im sure ill get some angry comments here but if youre an edwards supporter let me put this bluntly if you gave john and elizabeth edwards time money support or goodwill they played you they made a conscious decision to make their relationship a focus throughout the campaign that emotional goodwill you feel for them they not only let you feel they took actions and made statements specifically so you would feel it then when the rumors first surfaced they made the worst decision of all they decided to lie about it and to keep lying about it for months they lied in a way that made the people who were telling the truth look like the real liars they lied in a way that turned their supporters into attack dogs they only started to tell the truth when john edwards was caught at the beverly hills hilton and even now both john and elizabeth edward are calling the people who caught him the liars thats the definition of shameless

2630551 we pressed that switch together you know i couldnt ask you to shoulder the responsibility for something like that alone
2630552 i meant to but my resolve must have failed me i pressed the demat button without thinking survival instinct perhaps

2630557 the two of us on an uninhabited planet whats the point
2630558 and the man i travelled with never would have said that he never gave up hope however dark things got
2630559 he could have stopped the war from ever beginning all he had to do was touch two wires together
2630560 if you believe that the war must have affected you worse than i ever suspected you say that because youre angry and grief stricken and afraid its all right mercy and compassion arent weaknesses theyre what set us apart from the enemy maybe theyre the reason we lost but id rather lose than become like them so would you
2630561 i know your name but i never told you mine

2630570 he was obviously happier there he cried long enough when we dragged him out of there
2630571 eventually the sentients hooked up to the morpheus machine burn out and die
2630572 whatever he was dreaming in there was his hearts desire and it seemed absolutely real to him imagine being torn away from that havent you ever had a dream you wished were true rose how did you feel when you realised it wasnt

2630606 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2630607 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in

2630751 cuils goal is to solve the two great problems of search how to index the whole internet not just part of it and how to analyze and sort out its pages so you get relevant results
2630752 many web pages are similar to each other or represent auto generated content that isnt very useful to searchers
2630753 cuil prefers to find all the pages with your keyword or phrase and then analyze the rest of the content on those pages during this analysis we discover that your keywords have different meanings in different contexts once weve established the context of the pages were in a much better position to help you in your search
2630754 caldav is an open protocol that allows calendar access via webdav caldav models calendar events as http resources in icalendar format and models calendars containing events as webdav collections this allows you to publish and subscribe to calendars share them collaboratively sync between multiple users and sync between multiple devices
2630755 with caldav support in google calendar youll be able to view and edit your google calendar events directly in ical any changes you make in ical will automatically appear in google calendar the next time you sign in and vice versa if you use ical while offline changes you make will be saved and updated in google calendar when you get back online
2630756 the largest issue that i had is that i needed to create a new caldav server account for every calendar in google calendar not only did this make further setup cumbersome it degraded the ical ui as a 1 1 relationship between each folder server and calendar is created normal re ordering and organization of calendars does not work with this setup so be careful with the order you enter your calendars this multiple server setup also removed the ability to move events between different calendars within ical

2630762 all jon needed to read my mail was a packet sniffing program such software is free and widely available he used a mac program called eavesdrop it sniffs the airwaves and displays whatever data it finds being transmitted in the public hot spot
2630763 we use https to protect your password every time you log into gmail but we dont use https once youre in your mail unless you ask for it by visiting https mail google com rather than http mail google com why not because the downside is that https can make your mail slower your computer has to do extra work to decrypt all that data and encrypted data doesnt travel across the internet as efficiently as unencrypted data

2630856 phelps was an all star he is what he is
2630857 and he was the only one who was able to step up his game from the heats to the final it shows how good of a swimmer he is
2630858 but at the same time its all about competing i was just happy to go in there race against these guys and show that we belong
2630859 the main thing was to get into the final its going to be a little bit of a theme probably that these finals are so tough to make you really have to compete in the heats
2630860 so to be able to come back around and do it again in finals is definitely a challenge
2630861 ah i cant say that anything he does surprises me i mean this is the tiger woods of swimming here hes a superstar hes one of a kind and at the same time he makes everybody else better by going after him and even though he had the race pretty well today hes got a lot of races left and theres somebody whos gearing up to beat him every single day itll be exciting to watch him swim every day

2630863 your position seems to focus on your position as a pastor in a local congregation and somehow that has translated into a position over the entire body of christ
2630864 hyper authoritarian leaders instead lead people to themselves and indoctrinate them to be their followers in total submission to them and their authority in essence these dominating shepherds teach they are the church members de facto lord master and savior rather than christ
2630865 this is evidence of a mind that has not been sufficiently renewed and a conscience that has not been washed and revived by the word of god ephs
2630866 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to god which is your reasonable service and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
2630867 it is every pastors job to bring conviction upon gods people

2630889 he is what he is he was the only one who was able to step up his game from the heats to the finals and it showed how good a swimmer he is
2630890 i was just happy to go in there compete and race against these guys and show we belong
2630891 this is the tiger woods of swimming he is a super star one of a kind he makes everyone else better by going after him
2630892 he has a lot of races left there is somebody gearing up just to beat him every single day it will be exciting to watch him swim for the rest of the week
2630893 it doesnt change the race that much its just everybody is using a little bit better technology it might improve all the times a little bit more but the race is still the same
2630894 even though there was no chinese in my race it was loud as ive ever heard
2630895 the environment seemed to just keep getting bigger and louder
2630896 it makes it a lot easier to swim these hard races
2630897 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming
2630898 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2630899 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2630900 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2630901 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2630902 whenever you experience or feel something that you havent felt before its obviously a little bit scary
2630903 i think it might be some kind of muscle spasm or something because they both tightened up on me
2630904 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2630905 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2630906 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2630907 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2630908 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2630909 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defence we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2630910 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defence off the field right now
2630911 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2630912 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2630913 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a pre season game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2630914 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2630915 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2630916 i feel really confident going into the next three weeks
2630917 one thing weve really done over the years is rise to big games and special occasions and i think individually guys will be steeling themselves for this week
2630918 if we get up against geelong it would really set our season alight
2630919 if we can go into the one on one battles and win them individually even if we dont win but we play our style of footy it will really set us up for the last two rounds and hopefully some finals action
2630920 i was pretty happy with myself at halftime i had four goals in so i only needed one in the second half
2630921 i thought i played my role i was a bit lucky a few times when it got over the back
2630922 it gives us a bit of confidence to go in and take on a massive challenge next week
2630923 he is one of the best players that i have ever seen
2630924 ive obviously got to shoot some pretty good numbers coming in and tear up the course
2630925 if i can get back to something like even par that will be nice but the whole course is a lot easier so i dont think youll see scores slipping down any more
2630926 after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the rest of the round
2630927 i couldnt come back after that eight because i was mad
2630928 i was fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round
2630929 thinking its filtering the routes from going out of the

2630935 it is of the new things that men tire of fashions and proposals and improvements and change it is the old things that startle and intoxicate it is the old things that are young
2630936 we all want progress but if youre on the wrong road progress means doing an about turn and walking back to the right road in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive

2630938 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faith but to become dominant the koran should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
2630939 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2630940 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2630941 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2630942 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2630943 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2630944 youve got a base open so you dont have to throw a strike
2630945 i think the whole thing snowballed because we didnt throw strikes and couldnt put hitters away
2630946 we havent been getting ahead of guys but when we do get to two strikes we dont put hitters away
2630947 if that balls in the dirt he swings and misses youve got to execute pitches

2630953 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2630954 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2630955 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else

2630982 im from florida but this looks like frostbite to me what do you think
2630983 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2630984 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2630985 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2630986 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2630987 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2630988 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2630989 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2630990 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2630991 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2630992 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2630993 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2630994 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2630995 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2630996 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2630997 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2630998 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2630999 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2631000 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2631001 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2631002 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2631003 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2631004 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2631005 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2631006 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2631007 who are open to doing something on the production side
2631008 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2631009 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2631010 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2631011 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2631012 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2631013 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2631014 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2631015 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2631016 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2631017 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2631018 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2631019 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2631020 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2631021 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2631022 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2631023 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2631024 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2631025 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2631026 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2631027 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2631028 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2631029 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2631030 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2631031 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2631032 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2631033 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2631034 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2631035 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2631036 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2631037 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2631038 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2631039 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2631040 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2631041 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2631042 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2631043 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2631044 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2631045 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2631046 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2631047 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2631048 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2631049 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2631050 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2631051 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2631052 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2631053 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2631054 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2631055 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2631056 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2631057 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2631058 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2631059 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2631060 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2631061 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2631062 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2631063 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2631064 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2631065 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2631066 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2631067 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2631068 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2631069 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2631070 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2631071 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2631072 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2631073 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2631074 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2631075 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2631076 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2631077 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2631078 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2631079 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2631080 their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone
2631081 fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
2631082 fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god
2631083 fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore
2631084 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2631085 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2631086 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2631087 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2631088 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2631089 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2631090 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2631091 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2631092 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2631093 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2631094 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2631095 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2631096 i havent seen the same type of performance out of them recently
2631097 when i look at drivers i would favor for the championship i start with who has the most championships
2631098 i know about all the media hoopla and everything else thats brought around it
2631099 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2631100 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2631101 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2631102 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2631103 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2631104 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2631105 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2631106 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2631107 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2631108 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2631109 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2631110 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2631111 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2631112 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2631113 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2631114 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2631115 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2631116 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2631117 hello clubpenguin players this is the best site to write clubpenguin cheats
2631118 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2631119 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2631120 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2631121 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2631122 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2631123 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2631124 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2631125 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2631126 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2631127 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2631128 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2631129 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2631130 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2631131 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2631132 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2631133 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2631134 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2631135 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2631136 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2631219 when we started this work i had my doubts about the technology but as the facts poured in it became obvious that my initial assessment was wrong not only is this possible but space based solar power is probably the greatest opportunity to develop a safe clean source of energy that can readily be shared with all of humanity

2631221 when we started this work i had my doubts about the technology but as the facts poured in it became obvious that my initial assessment was wrong not only is this possible but space based solar power is probably the greatest opportunity to develop a safe clean source of energy that can readily be shared with all of humanity
2631222 the space frontier foundation fully supports all of the recommendations of this sbsp study that was led by the national security space office the big news of this study is that the pentagon may become a big customer for wireless power transmission as sbsp could save the lives of american men and women in war zones
2631223 in addition to the cost of american lives that are lost protecting fuel convoys in iraq the total price for electrical power at forward bases is at least 1 per kilowatt hour
2631224 merits significant further attention on the part of both the u s government and the private sector
2631225 sbsp requires a coordinated national program with high level leadership and resourcing commensurate with its promise but at least on the level of fusion energy research or international space station construction and operations
2631226 the space frontier foundation which has opposed many other federally funded space programs as being wasteful and or ineffective strongly supports a new national initiative for the u s government to finance and to incentivize the private industry investment sbsp
2631227 we call on the u s congress to give american sbsp companies the same loan guarantees that it is giving to the nuclear power industry in order to close the sbsp business case
2631228 although sbsp holds great promise to deliver clean and renewable energy to all nations of the world the potential environmental impacts of the various systems and mitigation options to minimize those impacts require greater study
2631229 the u s government must study the potential environmental impacts of the various approaches early enough to help make effective choices between the various technical alternatives
2631230 we plan to hold the u s government to its promise to adopt a green engineering approach
2631231 the space frontier foundation will host a conference on sbsp in july 2008 in washington d c for this purpose at this conference we will bring business government environmental policy and technology professionals together to discuss and promote the advancement of this breakthrough technology

2631233 the tradition that comes with this organization im proud to be apart of that i just want you to know that when you come in here and put the green on a responsibility comes with that and every time i suit up i think about that
2631234 its like that field of dreams if you build it they will come you may have to put your arms around a couple guys and take them with you but you cant drag them
2631235 we want to interview for the manager in training position is this time good for you
2631236 i was working with a group headquartered in london in the u k and this is a transnational group with business interests in africa in the middle east in europe and in the mediterranean and i was looking after the mediterranean business interest which was about 15 million u s
2631237 especially for a person like me where i know that i havent come here with something in the pipeline where ive come here as an immigrant and im setting myself up all over again ive come with a lot of transferable skills and a lot of credentials with a whole lot of references with the organizations that ive worked for what i basically need is to talk on a one on one basis with somebody who is a key decision maker in an organization of repute
2631238 the pitch that they make primarily focuses on their ability to give us relevant one on one interactions with people of like mind and similar positions
2631239 thats what they keep putting in all their presentations and all the dialogues
2631240 they keep telling us that 75 per cent of the job market is the hidden job market thats the one on one interactions and networking that were going to open up for you
2631241 for the first few months they bog you down with so much homework that youre willing to go through it just to allow them the opportunity to deliver their promise to you
2631242 i actually asked my counselor three months down the line as to when are we going to stop talking resume and profile is there somebody who has my resume whos actually professionally trying to figure out networking opportunities for me
2631243 in my case i was told that there were no jobs in my field anymore companies nowadays do not hire executive assistants anymore
2631244 i said well i find that totally ludicrous because first of all when i came in the sales person here told me id have no problem
2631245 the career counselor said you know jacob you have to do the networking i said no you are supposed to do the networking he said no
2631246 if i needed to do cold calling i dont need haldane for 5 000 for that
2631247 i can just surf the net you have whos hiring 2003 and whos hiring 2004 you can get that on a cd rom and youre good to go
2631248 if they had told us in their marketing pitch that we are going to be helping you build your resume and were going to be profile mapping and after youve done all that and determined your strengths and weaknesses then we will help you network i dont imagine any of us would have paid 5 000
2631249 a lot of the time they believe that haldane is an employment placement agency
2631250 i could be the very thing that they need in order to be able to get a job i might even be able to get the job for them
2631251 that would be like a used car salesman turning away 90 per cent of the customers who came on his lot that is absolutely ridiculous
2631252 we filed our case under the illinois consumer fraud act and what it prohibits is unfair and deceptive practices this is what our complaint alleges that the course of conduct by haldane and associates and various individuals adds up to unfair and deceptive practices
2631253 the biggest jobs are never advertised its as simple as that
2631254 there is an 80 per cent strong hidden market which is what we basically tap into we are part of that
2631255 we are very selective on who we take on as clients we have a 100 per cent success rate and therefore we want to do justice to our clients
2631256 if the salesman is saying that he is not following company policy and we will address the issue with that salesman
2631257 it was absolutely adamant you have to do it word for word
2631258 you start thinking about it and you realize oh my god ive just taken 4 500 plus gst out of their account that theyre going to have to pay and im telling you i felt sick i still have difficulty with that even today
2631259 they catch people when they are very vulnerable you know they saw me they saw a guy whos got a lot of credentials a lot of transferable skills itching to develop a network if we hone in on network network network hes going to part with the money
2631260 we received a call that someone was smelling fumes in the area and we investigated with the coast guard and found oil in the canal between the power plant and the barrier
2631261 it didnt get into dickinson bayou and was stopped in the canal but there was an impact to coastal waters

2631271 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2631272 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2631273 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2631274 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2631275 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2631276 the only people who give false promises are those who say things like we can keep interest rates at record lows and promises they no they can never keep

2631287 these operations are enough difficult three four ships are involved in them the attack is made out of them pirates are usually well prepared physically and quite merciless in achieving of their aims
2631288 difficult pirate attacks are financed by the organized crime with groupings which have enough resources captain pottengal mukundan explains they have networks by which they sell captured goods and places where they can hold stolen members of crew to ransom
2631289 it plays into the hands of pirates captain mukundan adds as the measures against pirates are not very effective they feel safe more and more sure about their forces its very important that the law machinery assume the measures to authenticate performers of pirate attacks and punish them by the law

2631291 in just a week and a half we have already laid on the beach for an entire afternoon gossiped about boys power walked chatted about shopping shared clothes and giggled about boobs and bras
2631292 the second time we didnt answer their knocks right away so they just knocked down the door
2631293 i looked outside and there were all of these firetrucks and police cars
2631294 it only took them 10 to 15 minutes to get everyone out and checked out at the same time they were investigating what was happening
2631295 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2631296 this afternoon i spoke for the second time since the crisis began with georgian president saakashvili
2631297 given this threat to euro atlantic security i am pleased to see the united states the european union and nato acting together by sending a delegation to the region in an effort to broker a cease fire this is an important first step
2631298 the united nations has been prevented from taking any meaningful action by russian objections in view of this i welcome the statements of democratic nations defending the sovereignty of georgia and condemning russian actions
2631299 i strongly support the declaration issued by the presidents of poland estonia latvia and lithuania and their commitment that aggression against a small country in europe will not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers

2631301 for the first part of the evening i bartended for the guests
2631302 im concerned about anti corporate and populist rhetoric from candidates for the presidency members of congress and the media it suggests to us that we have to demonstrate who it is in this society that creates jobs wealth and benefits and who it is that eats them

2631305 im sorry to say so but sadly its true that bang ups and hang ups can happen to you
2631306 you can get all hung up in a prickle ly perch and your gang will fly on youll be left in a lurch
2631307 youll come own from the lurch with an unpleasant bump and the chances are then that youll be in a slump
2631308 and when your in a slump your not in for much fun unslumping yourself is not easily done
2631309 you will come to a place where the streets are not marked some windows are lighted but mostly theyre darked a place you coul sprian both your elbow and chin do you dare to stay out do you care to go in how much can you lose how much can you win
2631310 and if you go in should you turn left or right or right and three quarters or maybe not quiet or go around back and sneak in from behind simple its not im afraid you will find for a mind maker upper to make up his mind
2631311 im afraid that some times youll play lonely games too games you cant win cause youll play against you
2631312 all alone whether you like it or not alone will be something youll be quite alot
2631313 and when your alone theres a very good chance youll meet things that scare you right out of your pants there are some down the road between hither and yon that can scare you so much you wont want to go on
2631314 but on you will go throught the weather be foul on you will go through your enemies prowl onward up many a frightening creek through yoru arms may get sore and your sneekers may leak
2631315 on and on you will hike and i know youll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are

2631319 to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
2631320 before we have our chat for some of us are out of breath and all of us are fat
2631321 is what we chiefly need pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed now if youre ready oysters dear we can begin to feed

2631323 it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice
2631324 cut us another slice i wish you were not quite so deaf ive had to ask you twice
2631325 to play them such a trick after weve brought them out so far and made them trot so quick
2631326 youve had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again

2631330 i go my ways and when i find a mountain rill i set it in a blaze and thence they make a stuff they call rolands macassar oil yet twopence halfpenny is all they give me for my toil
2631331 i sometimes dig for buttered rolls or set limed twigs for crabs i sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of hansom cabs and thats the way
2631332 by which i get my wealth and very gladly will i drink your honours noble health
2631333 ive a sceptre in hand ive a crown on my head
2631334 i honestly think anyone making the cut right now has still got a chance
2631335 those going out in the morning with the better greens can post a number and there is no reason why they cant get close to the lead
2631336 i was close to the cut at the open and finished tied for seventh i dont see why you cant do the same here
2631337 the guys at the top know how tough it can be and while they have played great golf to get there they need to play well to stay at the top
2631338 it is a very ugly scene up here with numerous villages completely isolated after local roads were washed away by the floods and landslides

2631350 estamos preocupados pero estamos tranquilos porque utilizaremos nuestra firmeza y nuestra fuerza
2631351 los partidos catalanes se cre an que hab an recibido un cheque en blanco con el estatut pero se han dado cuenta de que es un cheque sin fondos no hab a nada en el banco
2631352 la financiaci n debe alcanzarse a trav s de un acuerdo com n de todos los partidos y una negociaci n multilateral de todas las comunidades
2631353 dicen que no es un refer ndum que no es vinculante y que es respetuosa con la constituci n entonces para qu tal consulta para qu tanto ruido

2631357 varios miembros del consejo expresaron su firme apoyo a los esfuerzos de mediaci n internacionales particularmente los de la organizaci n para la seguridad y cooperaci n en europa y la uni n europea
2631358 se comprende que los cuatro partidos catalanes lamenten el incumplimiento del plazo incluso que critiquen las dilaciones que puedan ser imputables a la administraci n central pero un acuerdo es siempre cosa de dos har a mal el ejecutivo de zapatero en minusvalorar el malestar catal n no s lo del gobierno sino tambi n de la oposici n el empresariado y su sociedad civil pero har an pero los dirigentes catalanes si olvidasen que en el pacto est el xito y se colocaran en la tesitura de convertir la tensi n en enfrentamiento contribuyendo as a la inestabilidad por ejemplo bloqueando los presupuestos ser a tirar piedras tambi n contra su propio tejado
2631359 el plante de los socialistas catalanes ha envalentonado y radicalizado m s a n a ciu que ayer no dudaba en afirmar que el presidente zapatero pasar a la historia como el m s falso de espa a por prometer una cosa y hacer la contraria
2631360 creemos que esta estrategia es un error porque al tratar de escurrir el bulto el gobierno y el psoe dan a entender que no hay argumentos que oponer a las bravatas del psc y al victimismo nacionalista
2631361 justo hace dos a os advert amos de las peligrosas consecuencias

2631363 rodr guez zapatero abri la caja de los truenos y ahora no sabe c mo encauzar un asunto que se le va de las manos salv el estatuto cuando estaba al borde del fracaso impuso a montilla frente a maragall y prometi un desarrollo estatutario r pido y completo a las primeras de cambio ha tenido que dar marcha atr s y tal vez ahora prefiere esperar al pronunciamiento del tribunal constitucional sobre aspectos tan discutibles como la financiaci n y las relaciones bilaterales
2631364 el psoe quer a atraerse a erc y ahora ha conseguido que sus propios compa eros catalanes adem s del sector soberanista de convergencia se desplacen hacia posiciones extremas en plena crisis pol tica y econ mica el gobierno tendr que afrontar con eficacia el desaf o catalanista que l mismo ha provocado
2631365 a la espera del fallo del tribunal constitucional sobre el mismo estatut de rebotes imprevisibles asistimos sin duda a la negociaci n de mayor trascendencia entre la generalitat y el gobierno central que ha tenido lugar en los ltimos a os la sociedad catalana est ahora junto a sus pol ticos porque lejos de abstracciones ha entendido que el progreso del pa s no puede desvincularse de la suficiencia financiera de la generalitat el futuro concreto de m s de siete millones de personas tiene que ver con este debate

2631436 algunos tienen temor a los explosivos pero otros tienden a jugar con ellos a trasladarlos al interior de su casa los ponen encima de la televisi n en la sala como reliquia o en la cocina como adorno pues desconocen que existen cargas adicionales que no explotan al momento se ha incrementado el riesgo de explosivo por los artefactos dentro de casas pues personas que se consideran expertas los llevan a casa
2631437 tenemos un problema fuerte y es que la gente revent los r tulos que indicaban el peligro algunas personas las quitan por diversi n
2631438 los ni os campesinos son los que m s riesgos corren de ser v ctimas de una explosi n por una mina o un artefacto explosivo son el grupo m s vulnerable por su naturaleza inquieta curiosa y por el desconocimiento que tienen ellos observan a la gente que habla de las minas con tanta familiaridad y escuchan mentiras de gente que dice que se par en una mina y no le pas nada

2631449 cathy has a love hate affair with food especially carbohydrates
2631450 we established the fastball early and pounded the strike zone
2631451 then they got aggressive so we went to the breaking ball and got a lot of popups
2631452 its tough to come up with stuff to say every night
2631453 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2631454 i thought wed get some whacks at him the second time around
2631455 he kept us off balance youve got to tip your cap to him this is the second time hes thrown well against us
2631456 when you make them hit the ball and you dont walk anybody you can be very effective
2631457 one run isnt going to get you a win unless you get a shutout and we havent seen too many of those lately

2631460 its the first race and its probably one of the most important ones its about getting it out of your system
2631461 this offense is tailor made for someone of my athletic strengths
2631462 the icing on the cake is being able to play with donovan mcnabb and learn from brian westbrook its one thing to figure out the offense on your own but when you watch somebody do it exactly the way they want you to how can you mess it up there are really no excuses
2631463 i really cant say that i do theres a lot to coaching that people dont realize as a coach everyone is always behind you win or tie
2631464 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2631465 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
2631466 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
2631467 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2631468 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2631469 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
2631470 the conventional wisdom is that because of t he alleged unpopularity of the us in muslim societies any connection with the us government or even many us quasi governmental agencies is the kiss of death for local activists
2631471 it is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top arctic predator displaced by climate
2631472 we saw the polar bear on our first clear day after several days of poor weather
2631473 the bear didnt come near us but the prospect of maintaining a round the clock vigil while trying to do our surveys had us concerned
2631474 baikal is the greatest lake in the world it is a limitless reserve and source for water that all of humanity can drink without any sort of purification

2631477 theres a kind of work that just has to be done whether you like it or not and its just worked out that were the ones who have to do it
2631478 is an indicator of whether modern man can curb his appetite and preserve what nature has created
2631479 it may be controversial but that doesnt mean you dont talk about these issues if it is emotive if it is sensitive we still have to talk about discuss these things that is our position you need to discuss
2631480 what were saying is its not an issue of conversion were not questioning article 121 1a were not questioning article 3 of the federal constitution on the status of islam when you have two jurisdictions the civil and the syariah jurisdiction obviously there will be conflicts of law
2631481 when you have conflicts of law you need to resolve these conflicts this is what were looking at how do you resolve these issues that is all
2631482 he is shot in one eye the bullet exits the other eye
2631483 since we had ellsbury ninth and drew first rather than have our fastest guy get stuck behind our catcher well do this

2631485 i know theres been a lot of times hell come back to the bench even on a ball that wasnt a hit and hell say i feel better which is good hes taking some better passes more consistent sometimes guys as cold as they get they get just as hot
2631486 3 ringside world champions this year richard soto won his 2nd straight title matt suniga and steven duron won their first tokumbo adeniron was a runner up at 165lbs he lost a 2 1 decison in the finals our team had a strong showing we fought a total of 23 bouts winning 17 photos and detailed results will be posted on our website monday ramosboxing com

2631488 do not be afraid for i am with you i will bring your children from the east and gather them from the west
2631489 we are very disappointed in our results and the entire riviera team is focused on the companys financial performance
2631490 do you yet realize that what i want has absolutely nothing to do with what you desire what i want is for you to live with peace i want you to smile i want you to laugh a lot i want you to be surrounded in bliss thats what i want and i am willing to commit to that cause despite whatever it may take
2631491 the total amount of sunlight that falls on the planet is fossil fuel power we using now so we are awash in sunlight theres plenty of energy from sunlight we just havent begun to learn how to use it properly
2631492 theres no smoking gun here but theres a lot of spent shell casings and people who created problems in the delta
2631493 what started out as trouble for little fish like the delta smelt has blossomed into a problem for salmon and the whole state
2631494 its going to have a big effect on coastal communities
2631495 the status of sacramento fall chinook has suddenly collapsed to an unprecedented low level
2631496 the effect on california and oregon salmon fisheries is a disaster by any definition
2631497 there will be a huge economic impact and it will be felt more broadly on the coast than in 2006
2631498 this is unprecedented the sacramento fall chinook have always been a workhorse of a fish stock but not this year
2631499 everyone thinks i hate duane but in reality i love him the more that idiot fucks up in his personal life the more fodder for my films my sales go through the roof when i parody him and i cant wait to see what he does next
2631500 if evan gets out of line ill put him in his place
2631501 craigs just jealous he doesnt have as many awards as me
2631502 excuse me miss could you spot me i had this theory i wanted to test that an attractive woman like yourself would boost my testosterone levels and improve my performance
2631503 ok so the hypothesis was that the proximity of a cute girl increases testosterone levels and makes us stronger
2631504 the recent news that the alaska department of fish and game illegally killed 14 wolf pups as part of their efforts to boost caribou numbers and that they intentionally excluded this information from a june 30 press release only further diminishes the publics faith and trust in the departments ability to properly manage wolves and bears and follow the law
2631505 this is the first time in more than 20 years that department biologists shot and killed wolves from the air and the first time that it has killed pups in their den
2631506 over the past year the state has produced several publications as part of its 400 000 public education campaign designed to inform alaskans about the facts of its programs
2631507 yes you are right we must do as you say
2631508 flee from sexual immorality all other sins a person commits are outside their body but you who sins sexually sins against your own body do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor god with your body
2631509 i am dying from grief my years are shortened by sadness misery has drained my strength i am wasting away from within
2631510 the lord is more pleased when we do what is just and right than when we give him sacrifices
2631511 you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
2631512 stop urging me to abandon you for wherever you go i will go wherever you live i will live your people will become my people and your god will become my god rth 1 16 net

2631515 the lord is more pleased when we do what is just and right than when we give him sacrifices
2631516 i am dying from grief my years are shortened by sadness misery has drained my strength i am wasting away from within
2631517 then peter got down out of the boat walked on the water and came toward jesus
2631518 carmen put your eyes on jesus look up dont look down if you do this you will be cured
2631519 all i did was think about my circumstances and problems
2631520 i am dying from grief my years are shortened by sadness misery has drained my strength i am wasting away from within
2631521 the computer doesnt get bored it doesnt get tired and it doesnt forget
2631522 given expert input of data for the variables for such a model it would not surprise me in the least to see that it would perform well
2631523 this legislation will deter government agencies from violating the open meetings law
2631524 when government is required to be more open and accountable it benefits everyone it helps restore the peoples confidence in the public process
2631525 im ticked that i cant do everything that youre doing
2631526 being to give an added and permanent attraction to hawaii and make waikiki beach the home of the surfrider
2631527 its a travesty that the lpga would allow this happen
2631528 we were there for 21 years and the lpga trashes our event for one with no track record
2631529 i would never wish for the lpga to be unsuccessful
2631530 that wouldnt give us any degree of satisfaction but this the demise of the ginn tribute validates a view weve had all along
2631531 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2631532 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2631533 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2631534 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
2631535 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2631536 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2631537 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2631538 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2631539 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2631540 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2631541 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2631542 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2631543 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2631544 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2631545 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2631546 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2631547 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2631548 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2631549 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2631550 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2631551 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2631552 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2631553 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2631554 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2631555 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2631556 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2631557 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2631558 dude this is five hundred tickets and you get to pick a great cheap ass piece of shit prize for that what is the problem
2631559 the politics of harmony were conveyed in a visual extravaganza
2631560 since the berlin games of 1932 so memorably captured in leni riefenstahls magnificent documentary olympia
2631561 no one can fool me im livin in the city on a hill
2631562 we were expecting to get into the chart but we didnt know how high up wed get the music has always been good i believe charmaine diane they were good the first time around and theyre bound to be good the second time as well
2631563 when started they used to talk about us in their act in terms of us being the first irish band to hit the charts
2631564 its magic for us to be back in there among all those people here we are a couple of lads from dublin and were back in the charts again
2631565 dont spend too much on the box and the wrapping paper no matter how big the occasion your loved ones just want whats inside
2631566 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2631567 to be honest i really didnt feel that great going into the ready room i started getting these chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more excited i was pretty emotional after that race

2631573 girls are generally recognized as superior mimics those with as hold back and observe until they learn the rules then imitate their way through social situations
2631574 shared interest that has produced this coalition is understanding the nature of the mind
2631575 dont get me wrong wigs are groovy im just confused it happens
2631576 aahh with 3 channels back in the day we would watch cannon or barnaby jones or the olympics we chose olympics
2631577 we hooked like drugs was on my way to being a thug till you showed me love
2631578 grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation in georgia
2631579 it is clear that the conflict has now expanded in other areas than only south ossetia
2631580 regrettably i have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground within the council on a draft statement to the press
2631581 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2631582 the first thing that has to happen is that violence has got to stop and that foreign forces will have to be withdrawn
2631583 russia somehow thinks it is exempt from all the calls to cease violence from all the calls to withdraw
2631584 then we can talk about a variety of other things including military and political arrangements
2631585 i am not sure we are now at the point when the security council can pass a document or even a press statement which would be meaningful
2631586 seriously bob costas is weirding me out with the wig
2631587 last week you said you would do these six things did you get them done
2631588 socialization of work as critical to project management at google
2631589 what were looking for here is lots of accidental cross pollination
2631590 even an idiot knows not to install that crappy program windows vista even if its free
2631591 rather than digg you down like everyone else i ask what games does vista support that xp does not
2631592 that doesnt make me a moron i happen to like expensive trendy stuff im not an idiot i am rich is pretty cool especially now since its gone that makes my app a valuable collectors item worth more than 1 000 dollars if i sold it on ebay can i do that
2631593 i feel really bad for other people who bought that app like me because public ridicule is so hurtful were real people with real lives and lots of money not morons like everyone is reporting
2631594 rich morons with lots of money and real lives buying stupid
2631595 bad things always happen to me sometimes twice a day
2631596 some jackass stopped me and asked if i wanted to buy his mint condition sealed copy of windows vista for 1 000 even an idiot knows not to install that crappy program even if its free
2631597 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2631598 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2631599 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2631600 it is clear the situation is dire i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2631601 diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia
2631602 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2631603 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
2631604 they are no longer with the company for violating the terms of their employment agreements with the station
2631605 its not like its a party that were holding that peter didnt come to

2631636 en ning n momento de la conversaci n mantenida entre los tres el se or cocca se refiri al laboratorio protagonista de los hechos cuyo nombre curiosamente oculta si no se sabe qu laboratorio es la denuncia de sobreprecio queda sin sentido porque se desconoce el autor de la maniobra especulativa por ello ese tema fue ajeno a mi decisi n adem s la directora le imput serias irregularidades docentes respecto de las cuales nada respondi por lo que como responsable acad mico del rea deb prescindir de sus tareas dado que la universidad kennedy es privada y las relaciones con los trabajadores docentes se rigen por la ley de contrato de trabajo se puede prescindir de ellos tema que se decidir en la demanda laboral que el sr cocca ha iniciado contra la universidad en la que se ha considerado despedido
2631637 en absoluto no hablamos ni del laboratorio y ni de la conversaci n en el congreso
2631638 solamente quien me desconozca puede afirmar que yo sea empleado o vinculado a un laboratorio incluso fantasma lo mismo puedo afirmar de la directora de la escuela
2631639 no lo cito porque a quien me dirij en la conferencia es a las c maras farmac uticas que son las que hablan por los laboratorios

2631652 oh how nice you always have been so good with your hands
2631653 guarenteed to offend regardless of religion race national origin sexual orientation or profession
2631654 we have a bunch of security vulnerabilities but are too lazy to be bothered with them so shut up dont let the public know that theyre being screwed if you do well take you to court yeah i told you to shut up but you didnt listen so now ill court order you to stop talking our problems dont exist

2631658 chandrasinh was close to my cousins and these women made him prepare a will before he died in hospital
2631659 our film is running to packed houses in cinema halls across the state
2631660 theyre hits gujarati entertainment industry owes a lot to the goddess
2631661 many parties are visiting the hospitals to assess requirement of cctvs in the buildings and on campus funds will not be a constraint when it comes to the issue of stepping up security at these hospital premises
2631662 the numbers of cctvs required for each of the amcrun hospitals and institutes will be decided once the bidders do a final survey of the premises
2631663 cctv systems surveillance is required for monitoring the behaviour of people suspicious movements objects within hospital campuses for security control
2631664 around 20 lakh people will be walking up to ambaji on bhadarvi poonam we will support those who want to paint on public interest issues such as nirogi balak or beti bachao we want the mountains to speak
2631665 this is an extremely bad idea apart from ecological damage the entire stretch is an accidentprone zone the paintings are likely to distract drivers and cause mishaps
2631666 it is a really bad idea to paint rocks they have historical and geological significance and need to be maintained in original form they are heritage and should not be touched
2631667 if theyre painted landscaping will be destroyed apart from being part of the rich environment these rocks have geological cultural historical and aesthetic value considering the earlier sc decision if painting of rocks is allowed here there may be legal problems as well
2631668 the youths then dragged chauhan out of his cabin and started beating him up when anil panchal the conductor on the bus tried to intervene he was also beaten up by the youths they were angry that when they signalled the bus to stop in the middle of the road the driver did not oblige
2631669 the apartments are four decades old there was a natural drainage system which got blocked over time and flooding and water logging became routine affairs we decided to divert flood waters to recharge groundwater says rupal desai a resident
2631670 we had an old well on the premises which we converted to a recharge structure in which all the water coming from outside is recharged another system is on the roof for rainwater this is being diverted from all four blocks into a borewell
2631671 time has come to go for artificial groundwater recharge at mass level we dont recharge sufficiently considering amount of groundwater we draw
2631672 certainly there is inadequate security on most amc premises even security personnel deployed dont have metal detectors or reflecting mirrors to check visitors or vehicles entering the premises
2631673 we dont have much motivation left as we have to do all sorts of odd jobs many of us have quit because we havent been given any assurance about our job prospects
2631674 tenders are awarded not on basis of quality but proximity to higher ups in the corporation or political affiliations for instance a relative of the former mayor has been awarded the contract for security upkeep
2631675 not only left a hole in the areas donut options but had sprinkled the area with empty stores id give you some dry business reasons but your eyes would glaze over
2631676 you understand those are donut puns right because youre not smiling
2631677 concentrate our resources on our sole outlet on patterson new jersey which is almost running out of soap in the bathroom and really needs a good mopping
2631678 in the aftermath of blasts several people have been detained of these some are suspects in hawala racket they got funds on the pretext of trust activities we have approached higher authorities to permit us for accounts check
2631679 why these animals can exist on one side of hwy 280 and not on the other is beyond me
2631680 it was a great peace of mind knowing no one could take him from me
2631681 i think theres probably a good case that can be made for why we want to look at this
2631682 i know there are lots of beekeepers in the city but its not like we have a secret society or secret handshake
2631683 i was like no hes supposed to be low key
2631684 someone called and said there was a goat in the beer tent and so we had to leave
2631685 as with any city department if there is a violation of city ordinance we do respond to that
2631686 they set lofty goals aim at the stars type of thing
2631687 theyre waiting to see what ethanol reallys going to do
2631688 is it really the future or is hydrogen the future they dont want to invest a lot of money and time in something that may be a fad
2631689 the automakers are reluctant to promote flex fuel vehicles in areas where there are no e85 pumps and gas stations dont want to put in e85 pumps where there are no flex fuel vehicles
2631690 we are unaware of any company that has told any gas station owner they cannot switch to e85
2631691 cant even comment on it im sorry its like youve asked me the college quiz bowl question what is e85
2631692 unaware of one of the most important issues and economic tools for all of greater minnesota
2631693 primarily employed persons who have illegally entered or are illegally present in the united states these persons are placed by olen staff co in work assignments with other companies
2631694 have facilitated concealed and derived substantial income from this employment of illegal aliens
2631695 it has been many years since we have used their services it is our policy not to comment on pending litigation
2631696 i talked to our lawyer and he told me not to answer any questions
2631697 we work very hard on convincing business owners to be socially responsible and that means you need to do your job you need to do your documentation
2631698 every single week andy went over to see sawyer to do something with him
2631699 hed take him out to the movies crutches and all
2631700 he wanted to show that life is fleeting and that the only thing that can really satisfy us is eternity and christs love
2631701 he was a friend of guys who liked to party a friend of spiritual people a friend of kids a friend of senior adults
2631702 everyone would say i want a piece of what this guy has
2631703 he wasnt the prototypical homecoming king blown back sandy blonde hair and 14 inch biceps
2631704 people loved him for the size of his heart not his external qualities
2631705 andy set the standard for us in character leadership self control and self sacrifice
2631706 cmon you are tougher than this you can give more get up that hill
2631707 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
2631708 the sad truth is that the way we drive is responsible for a good part of our traffic problems
2631709 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2631710 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2631711 going into turn three i was like finally im going to win a race
2631712 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say every time he wins i finish second and unfortunately every time i finish second he finishes first weve got to change that
2631713 you got to go you got to go hes coming
2631714 it was the opportunity to play strategy and i give the total credit to tim cindric
2631715 this is one of the first races where we didnt have the car but we took chances
2631716 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races
2631717 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
2631718 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming
2631719 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2631720 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2631721 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2631722 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2631723 to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee
2631724 death is no freedom from judgement on the contrary he doesnt even have to hear it
2631725 to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee
2631726 death is no freedom from judgement on the contrary he doesnt even have to hear it
2631727 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2631728 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2631729 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2631730 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2631731 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2631732 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2631733 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2631734 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2631735 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2631736 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2631737 so the doctor will know where to look when he gets in here
2631738 well its down at the end of the hall around there pointing
2631739 would it be okay if i wheeled myself i broke my toe last week and its pretty sore
2631740 uh i was just looking for something else to read
2631741 im just waiting on one of your lab results to come back and then ill be in to talk to you
2631742 australia must radically improve job security and income for researchers or risk losing the best and brightest to overseas a top academic says flinders university deputy vice chancellor chris marlin will tell a federal parliamentary inquiry in adelaide on wednesday that a 50 per cent lift in income for research students and enhancing employment prospects would boost the number of home grown researchers

2631753 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was
2631754 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2631755 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2631756 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2631757 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2631758 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too
2631759 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2631760 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2631761 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2631762 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2631763 my brother was kind of like the big superstar and i was just the kid brother
2631764 from pee wee ball to middle school to high school he was the one that everybody wanted to watch play
2631765 im getting a little more nervous every day because i know each day im one day closer to being in that game
2631766 we were cowboys fans and at halftime wed go out in the backyard and throw it around
2631767 id have mike lined up on one side and brian on the other and every time i threw mike the ball hed just sit there and giggle
2631768 it was after a track meet one day and i was just kidding around with the boys
2631769 so we were standing in the parking lot and i said
2631770 another day after practice i was talking to glen oak head coach jack rose
2631771 usually i had brian right there to guide me and give advice and out there helping me but when he got hurt i had to become my own player
2631772 it just reached a point where i thought they needed to show a little more interest if they really wanted me
2631773 my brother was putting in a good word for me and i would have loved to have gone and played with him but you have to do whats best for you
2631774 but i really think that it was a blessing in disguise at the time he was able to go to kentucky and get away from the whole brother comparison thing hes dealt with that his whole life now hes got the chance to make a name for himself
2631775 were both pumped because we havent really seen mike play
2631776 well probably be fighting it out for kentucky duty every week
2631777 make all the easy throws dont turn it over too much and rely on the great players around you
2631778 thats basically what todd did last year and now you hear his name being mentioned for the heisman
2631779 yeah but todds at ohio state but mikes got some good players around him theyve got talent
2631780 weve got to put those expectations on him you dont say that a kid cant do something were doing the exact same thing in practice that we were doing when andre was here we havent tweaked our offense because weve got a new quarterback were running the same plays we expect him to make all the throws and so far hes done it hes been as sharp as ive ever seen him the first few days of practice
2631781 after the thing with curtis went down i could tell in his voice he was a little overwhelmed
2631782 and ill admit i was worried about him mentally and emotionally
2631783 if it gets to be too much let us know
2631784 although 98 of women can potentially have a successful vbac in two percent of cases the result can be a rupture of the old scar if this happens then death of the baby is almost certain and death of the mother is probable even if the mother does not die virtually 100 will lose their child bearing ability
2631785 this is your land see i have given you all manner of trees and fruits and good things for food all of you must work hard and take care of the land and share the plenitude of the land fairly and justly with each other so that you can all enjoy the land which i the all high have given to you
2631786 they have asked me to use my mighty hand to guide them but they do not take my counsel
2631787 i have juvenile diabetes they discovered when i was 8 i have crohns disease they diagnosed at the age of four juvenile diabetes gave me heart disease and we discovered that when i was 14 and that lead to having many heart attacks
2631788 it wasnt really a life because they had me on so much valium so i was knocked out most the time
2631789 they had to give me 12 injections between each rib into my heart and lungs and then they had to stick an 8 inch needle in my belly button and swirl it around in each organ
2631790 she was so tired and weak and within 22 minutes she could do anything and everything she couldnt do before
2631791 weve had people says that the umbilical that its aborted babies that im taking a life to save her life i would not do that
2631792 our home i lost it the other day i lost my vehicles i have nothing left thats all thats left from our whole family is that car corvette
2631793 it will be hard but well get the money it would mean a lot to get it because a lot of sacrifices were made for me
2631794 all we have received from central government is 8 million and this is completely inadequate
2631795 the municipal engineer in checking our major drains gave us an estimate of j 68 million for our drain cleaning project
2631796 we have in my estimation approximately 400 000 citizens living in portmore and the truth of the matter is that should a disaster strike portmore it is not the minister or the municipality who is going to be held responsible it is the mayor
2631797 we have already dedicated 5 million to the cleaning of our smaller drains but the state of our major drains is creating some anxiety as a result i have written a letter to minister of transport and works mike henry seeking his assistance to get the work done
2631798 it would not be fair for us to shoulder the responsibility of the national works agency nwa and in truth we are not in a position to do so
2631799 as far as it appears we are expected to finance central governments responsibilities and this cannot happen
2631800 we have completed phase one of the national mitigation programme which we embarked on in may of this year we have also made a request for additional funds and will soon begin work on phase two of the drain network not just in portmore but across the country
2631801 portmore has a history of inland and coastal flooding from storm surges
2631802 many storms that pass through the island begin their entry along portmores south coast also an increasing number of persons are at risk as portmore is the fastest growing community in the island
2631803 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud
2631804 both my husband and i came from very traditional families where the mothers had stayed at home and thats what i wanted for my kids too
2631805 ive never regretted my decision sometimes people will say to me but what will you do when hannah starts school but this is it for me i have arrived im not wondering how quickly i can get rid of them and back to work
2631806 i want to spend time with them i find it rewarding and i think they benefit too they get home cooked meals to play with their friends after school and the three of them also get to spend time with each other which wouldnt really happen if they were in after school care
2631807 i understand that if you have a job such as a teacher with child friendly hours or if you had to train for years to be something like a gp or a lawyer then it must be hard to give that up
2631808 but i dont think i would have liked it especially when they were little i mean if you pick up your children from nursery at 6pm and have to feed them and put them to bed by 7pm then it almost seems more like processing them than looking after them
2631809 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
2631810 they women get themselves bloody pregnant and they always argue theyll be working until the day before they have the baby go down to the river wash it off give it to the nanny and be back at work the following day but sure enough their brains turn to mush and then after the birth their maternal instincts kick in they take three months off get it out of their system and are back to normal
2631811 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the supermum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealistic by ordinary mortals
2631812 its hard to deny feminist thinking played a very significant role
2631813 whether at school at work or in bed there has been an almost moral imperative on young women to seek something better and by implication to be dissatisfied with what theyve got
2631814 its not something you hear very often these days but i really like my job
2631815 it has taken me a long time to get established i feel i am doing something of value and i am fulfilled and i suppose as amy gets older it will be important to be a role model to her to show her women can work and have children that it is possible
2631816 of course i feel guilty when i cant be with her especially if shes under the weather but i think im a better mother because i work
2631817 whenever there is this groundswell of opinion that family life is being damaged couples may worry they are not spending more time with the children and may decide to make changes but mostly those changes will involve the woman rather than the man doing less work
2631818 a lot of workplace culture in the private sector is male orientated and revolves around long working hours in an economic downturn that can become even more entrenched and if you are a woman with childcare issues then perhaps you stand out and feel under even more pressure than usual
2631819 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home
2631820 the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working hours means women are presented with impossible choices the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are strait jacketed by gender stereotypes
2631821 support both men and women to be their most authentic selves in the world shedding prescribed gender roles and really getting in touch with their authentic desires passions and ethics
2631822 feminist workplaces would nurture both men and women fostering their relationship with their children and fulfilling work lives the most exciting thing about feminism is that it is ultimately about leading more fulfilling ethical joyful lives characterised by more healthy and genuine relationships
2631823 when it is time to go it is time to go
2631824 we both have intel does not have the high level of graphics chip processing power is also an open platform
2631825 but so far we do not have any prosecution of intels plan
2631826 the chinese market let alone achieve long term success even the short term success is also difficult to obtain
2631827 next we need to further expand our business the staff at the same time not too fast on the increase in other words our business growth should be guaranteed based on the capacity
2631828 its a good thing you have all those other things to do
2631829 oh jolie dont start getting all angry just because you cant go
2631830 what makes you think your schedule is more important than his
2631831 if not the olympic games many people do not know cctv
2631832 business partners 9 the public dissemination of partners have made 172 applications 106 have to be approved
2631833 cctv is the goal of the olympic games bigger and stronger through the influence to become the nations largest video site integrated media website and in the future development into a video at the core of the comprehensive portal
2631834 this is the beijing olympics in order to achieve the commitments of the world
2631835 tea as usual to take sugar nothing on maofang emergency a time to work on you control how long the contingent of
2631836 in india cricket crazy for all rather than the olympic games
2631837 mira apuntado a la im agen siguente y los del hotel no les dicen nada
2631838 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2631839 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2631840 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2631841 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2631842 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2631843 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2631844 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2631845 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2631846 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2631847 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2631848 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2631849 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2631850 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2631851 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2631852 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2631853 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2631854 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2631855 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2631856 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2631857 they activision liked my music and i have a big young following ive been told im from the old school i dont own a computer i just got an ipod that ive organized i have got to learn how to turn it on thats about it you know i cant download i cant do any load

2631860 offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer to peer distribution of intellectual property as well as a plan to explore technology based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity
2631861 the mpaa is applauding top democratic politicians for introducing an anti piracy bill that threatens the nations colleges with the
2631862 offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer to peer distribution of intellectual property as well as a plan to explore technology based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity
2631863 offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer to peer distribution of intellectual property
2631864 btw why in the world do colleges need to be involved in
2631865 the recording industry is already willing to offer unlimited downloads with subscription plans for 10 to 15 per month through services such as napster and rhapsody
2631866 if people arent using these already what makes anyone thing that a college offering the same will suddenly be more successful
2631867 unless a school using the tool has firewalls on the borders of its network designed to block unsolicited internet traffic and a great many universities do not
2631868 the toolkit allows an administrator to require a username and password for access to the web server the problem is that the person responsible for running the toolkit is never prompted to create a username and password
2631869 even with a firewall keeping non university students from accessing the toolkits web server any student on the network armed with the internet address of the web server could view all of the traffic on his or her segment of the network said penns dave taylor
2631870 it is no business of a college which people pay to attend to be factoring into their cost model marketing and or service costs of music movie distribution
2631871 universities already pay blanket fees so that student a cappella groups can perform on campus and they also pay for cable tv subscriptions and site licenses for software
2631872 by the same token they could collect a reasonable amount from their students for
2631873 universities already pay blanket fees so that student a cappella groups can perform on campus
2631874 is this a good law or not and give me the gist of it

2631876 panasonics toughbook cf 29 comes closer to an indestructible notebook than anything weve seen
2631877 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2631878 russian jet fighters have dropped three bombs on tbilisis airport
2631879 i have foriegn policy experience because i lived somewhere before i hit puberty
2631880 shesh i think we are gonna need a bigger booth
2631881 i jis don like her shes got some splainin to do
2631882 once upon a time we used to fight this nemesis and now we are paying for our reluctancy because we were stupid enough to downplay it
2631883 in 20 years it will become obvious that we were all duped but during that 20 years the global warming crowd will have a field day
2631884 i mean the only point up for debate is why global warming is happening
2631885 theres no question that some states have made choices to be greener than others
2631886 some states are benefiting from both cheap electricity while polluting the planet and make all the rest of us suffer the consequences of global warming
2631887 so much environmental collapse has at last awakened much of the world particularly the 141 nations that have ratified the kyoto treaty to reduce emissions the bush administration however has shown no willingness to address the warming crisis in a serious way and congress has not been much more encouraging sens john mccain and joe lieberman have twice been unable to get even mild measures to limit carbon emissions through a recalcitrant senate
2631888 as ive said before as soon as the majority of meteorologists who study such things for a living believe that global warming is a problem currently around 20 believe ill begin to take notice
2631889 you cannot find a real industrialist anywhere in the world
2631890 the overwhelming balance of evidence shows no appreciable warming trend in the past 20 years nor indeed since about 1940 while some surface readings in far away locations mainly eastern siberia and the tropical oceans show warming trend the well maintained stations in the united states do not weather satellite date the only true global measurements we have show no warming neither the independent data from weather balloons which confirm the satellites in all respects in addition so called proxy data i e non thermometer records from tree rings ice cores etc show no warming
2631891 those of us who have been fighting against the torrent of lies surrounding and advocating the global warming theory thought we might rest at last safe in the knowledge that the new president understood how completely absurd it was how absurd it is to even consider us participation in the kyoto treaty that permits twenty other nations to do nothing while we ruin our economy finally from american policy center article
2631892 you cant find a real scientist anywhere in the world who can look you in the eye and without hesitation without clarification without saying kinda mighta sorta if and or but
2631893 could not afford emission cuts that would hurt its economy
2631894 i feel badly for us as a country that we have been put into this position
2631895 it will cost us in the long run and its already costing us in terms of credibility

2631930 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2631931 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2631932 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2631933 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2631945 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2631946 its certainly a down day certainly for the american people

2631950 whether or not its a toll road or its not a toll road is inconsequential
2631951 this takes care of the worst of the bottlenecks the toll facility ends up paying for the non toll facility all folks win in this deal
2631952 whether or not its a toll road or its not a toll road is inconsequential over the next twenty years youre going to see development more than double
2631953 to take an existing road thats already there and turn it into a toll road and say its an improvement i have some issues with that
2631954 i dont think the public is shell shocked anymore i think when you have 350 to 400 000 toll tags on cars in central texas people are looking for more places to use them because their experience i think has been very positive
2631955 we dont add signalization to the non tolled facilities for the sake of trying to drive people to the toll road that would show a complete lack of ethics and integrity
2631956 in my mind it will become an inconvenience to take it from 60 to 45 and unless they time the light correctly it may take me even longer to get out onto the road
2631957 folks that will be moving they know the toll road is coming we were here thats what i hear a lot
2631958 the builder doesnt care how we feel because this is about money
2631959 there will be lower speed limits on the frontage roads because thats where the intersections will be and thats where the neighborhoods would be so we dont want to inundate those neighborhoods with 70 mile per hour traffic if you want to drive 70 youd better get on the toll road
2631960 you always hear you dont have to take the toll road you can take the free road i contend yes that is true but to whose convenience

2632100 but gov perry remains resolute spokesman robert black admits the federal government has a big sort of dilemma because the united states as a whole is obligated to abide by

2632251 durante a nossa vida aprendemos a valorizar coisas que n o s o fundamentais
2632252 o bom humor nos salva das m os do doutor
2632253 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2632254 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2632255 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2632256 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2632257 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2632258 in the end you have to be able to say do i really want to make this loan because i may have to eat it
2632259 they would say and fannie mae and freddie mac were part of it this is a complex global market if you start interfering with the free flow of money then georgia will become an island that has no credit i kept telling them youre in for a crash here
2632260 in the face of this horrible mess we still dont have firm clear regulations to protect consumers like prohibiting loans the borrower cant repay or gouging on price
2632261 freddie mac was up in albany working hard to gut the bills language this past spring
2632262 not conforming to an ordinary type or pattern unconventional offbeat humor
2632263 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2632264 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2632265 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2632266 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call
2632267 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2632268 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2632269 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2632270 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2632271 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2632272 great teachers dont set high expectations great teachers set the right expectations for each student
2632273 major but lets not be stupid when doing it release

2632278 not just boring stories reconsidering the gender gap for boys
2632279 there are always ears on the other side of the wall and on both sides of this ridiculous haircut
2632280 no i said make it look ironic and shitty not like a guy shitting
2632281 i hope you learned these two things from me retirement count down 8
2632282 five and a half ways to lose followers and irritate your tweeps contains naughty language
2632283 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2632284 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2632285 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2632286 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2632287 la lucha va a continuar de hecho hemos abierto algunas puertas en el mbito internacional est n quit ndole el derecho al pueblo a elegir y al ciudadano a ser electo
2632288 making the band 4 and watching these producers work with donnie is his upcoming album going to sound like that do we need another justin

2632291 we have to set the table for the bug guys
2632292 he struggled in the first inning then he settled in and threw the ball well
2632293 id say his stuff is back hes got a different look about it

2632295 the collapse of the auction rate securities market was a direct result of defendants unilateral decision to no longer artificially support the auction rate securities market
2632296 because the background check and transfer to the teen grid takes time
2632297 the team is looking great and the defense is looking great
2632298 now we just have to keep stepping things up like we did today things are going great and as long as we keep working hard and playing hard in practice we will continue to improve
2632299 we have more depth this year it is very noticeable
2632300 that is definitely the biggest difference that i see from last year i read somewhere that we have 105 guys in camp and you can see that depth at a number of positions
2632301 it helps now that we know what coach hawk and the staff expect from us
2632302 we can go out to practice and know what the coaches expect from us and what they want us to do we can pass that knowledge along to the freshman and help their transition to college be quicker our ability to do that is really helping the team bond our team unity is great this year and that is going to help us all season
2632303 the offense has further to go than the defense and i think that was evident today
2632304 the new forum will provide much needed information to the
2632305 my descriptions of the city are based on the accounts of the citizens of coventry as well as on eyewitness accounts of the bombing of baghdad
2632306 cats stay with the building thinks harriet dogs go with the people
2632307 the bombs feel to harriet like all these things an earthquake shaking the ground lightening striking the earth the deep sonorous toll of a bell when something is unnatural there is no new language for it the words to describe it must be borrowed words from the old language of natural things
2632308 the awful moment when he realizes his life is not what he thought he has been operating in the world as a predator and now he understands that he really is prey
2632309 equipped to be around the sights and sounds of people
2632310 contractions started kicking in i sat there with her right between her legs we got tribal on it we danced to it i was dj ing this brazilian music we were jamming she was sweating no painkiller lets go
2632311 i felt like i was a kid or something out there
2632312 all those times goofing around in my front yard i always imagined myself pitching here
2632313 i think hell be happy anyway because of the way he pitched
2632314 to pitch here was his childhood dream come true well one of them anyway
2632315 he did what i was looking for and what joe was looking for
2632316 los aviones de combate rusos han arrojado tres bombas contra el aeropuerto de tiblisi
2632317 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2632318 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2632319 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2632320 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2632321 im just not real upset about it im just going to move on ive already done that
2632322 its the first bad outing ive had in a long time im not going to look much into it
2632323 some guys understand how to handle the media a little bit better than others
2632324 when you play in new york not only is it a learning process on how to play in new york i think its also a learning process on how to say exactly what you mean i can tell you the results bothered him
2632325 this government prepares world class athletes so dont blame us for bread shortages but look instead at the incompetence of your local officials
2632326 hey theres washington dc to the north with 3 major airports and even norfolk to our east why would an air carrier choose richmond
2632327 neighbors feared the project would worsen parking congestion and noise on their streets
2632328 i am bothered by the fact it has a solid street front and doesnt seem to fit the character of the neighborhood
2632329 neighbors feared the project would worsen parking congestion and noise on their streets
2632330 i am bothered by the fact it has a solid street front and doesnt seem to fit the character of the neighborhood
2632331 because most martial arts methods incorporate eastern teaching and techniques the martial arts are easy doorways into taoism buddhism confucianism and other non christian religions
2632332 traditionally martial arts are forms of spiritual education that function as means towards self realization or self enlightenment it is true that the spiritual dimension of martial arts can be downplayed or ignored but that is not consistent with their ultimate purpose historically
2632333 before and after any taekwondo class the students meditate first you may be asked to clear your mind of all thought and to relax completely the 2nd method of meditation is related to visualization
2632334 many of the patterns of taekwondo are rooted in semi mystical taoist philosophy and their deeper meaning is said to be far more important than the mere performance of a gymnastics series of exercises
2632335 ilyo is a pattern which has a spiritual orientation containing 24 movements the title of the pattern refers to the development of a state of spiritual enlightenment which is one of the ultimate aims of the disciple of taekwondo the student who has attained ilyo is capable of completely spontaneous reaction without any interference from the conscious mind
2632336 induce him to stay and gamble at the wynn casino
2632337 intentionally miscalculates markers and forges the high rollers signatures in order to change a high rollers win to a loss
2632338 the claims made in the counter suit by joe francis are not only false but scurrilous beyond imagination mr francis obviously felt secure making such defamatory statements under the protection of a judicial pleading however he has recently made other false and defamatory public statements we not only intend to press the proper charges for collection of his gambling debts but we will also pursue mr francis for damages resulting from those incredibly damaging and libelous statements each and every statement made by mr francis is an outrageous falsehood and he will be held accountable for those statements
2632339 first our technical analyst friends would state the recent move up is still well within the range of a bear market correction
2632340 second from a fundamental standpoint we still have major headwinds
2632341 to provide some impetus for home sales and of the positive lateral economic activity that goes with it
2632342 every recovery has a catalyst at the end of world war i it was u s soldiers returning from europe at a time of innovation at the begin of the 1920s they purchased everything in site got married and then purchased even more stuff
2632343 it produced the economic boom of the 1920s in the 1990s we had the birth of the world wide web and the technology boom that increased productivity and transformed business processes
2632344 you get what you concentrate upon there is no other main rule
2632345 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2632346 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2632347 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2632348 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2632349 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2632350 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2632351 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2632352 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2632353 laura su esposa y yo acabamos de tener la gran alegr a y el gran privilegio de practicar aqu en pek n en china
2632354 esto muestra simplemente que dios es universal que dios es amor y que ning n estado ning n hombre ni ninguna mujer deber an tener miedo del amor de la religi n
2632355 superan los marcos de la comprensi n de las acciones militares
2632356 en mi opini n se trata de elementos de una especie de genocidio contra el pueblo oseta creo que ser a justo que ordenara usted a la fiscal a militar que documente dichos incidentes sobre todo porque la mayor parte de la poblaci n osea son ciudadanos rusos
2632357 san francisco faced with the discovery of a serious flaw in the internets workings computer network administrators around the world have been rushing to fix their systems with a cobbled together patch now it appears that the patch has some gaping holes on friday a russian physicist demonstrated that the emergency fix to the basic internet address system known as the domain name system is vulnerable and will almost certainly be exploited by criminals
2632358 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2632359 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
2632360 so im not surprised there is a disproportionate number of un ratified contracts this year
2632361 what is sobering is that no one knows how much state aid they will get next year so people dont want to promise what they dont have
2632362 we have no state education formula to help predict what communities will receive and its possible that if the states financial situation doesnt improve the legislature could reduce state aid to education a year from now we just dont know
2632363 in good or bad years there is still a local element to this that is temperamental and idiosyncratic
2632364 so now we have what weve had for years we dont have a right to strike in this state but at the same time teachers can have a work action and then be ordered back to work by a judge
2632365 i dont want to get my hopes up i just try to spend all the time with him i can
2632366 its the obligation of guatemala to support all guatemalans regardless of where they are
2632367 this will help for this month maybe next but this legal process will take more than a year
2632368 if theyre causing trouble its one thing if not they should be left alone theyre doing jobs no one wants to do
2632369 if the employers were paying fair wages to people who clean toilets and make beds then americans would be doing those jobs
2632370 but americans wont do those jobs for 7 an hour
2632371 people understand when they come here that they have the risk of being discovered and if they get discovered they get deported
2632372 you dont like to see anyone deprived of something but her father should be deported he put himself at risk
2632373 tell governor carcieri i said thank you there are drug dealers and rapists out there and hes doing this to my father
2632374 strange hes one of the important things to happen in music
2632375 if you had problems problems disappear because youre still here and theyre still here
2632376 i try not to live in the past the only time i do that is when im writing my book im out hearing young people im into artistry
2632377 as a touring artist you hardly ever get to go to shows its awesome
2632378 physicians dont view abuse toward the elderly the same way they view child abuse
2632379 i think we have an ethical responsibility a moral responsibility and were shirking it
2632380 if you see signs that a person may have been abused you need to ask has anybody hurt you are you afraid of anybody how did this happen if the explanation doesnt fit with what you see you need to probe further
2632381 an immediate report to the state department of elderly affairs failure to make such a report is a crime punishable by up to a year in prison and or a 1 000 fine
2632382 the reporting issue didnt cross my mind i was ignorant myself
2632383 physicians dont view abuse toward the elderly the same way they view child abuse
2632384 nobody ever gets into trouble for not reporting it at least in rhode island
2632385 sometimes physicians dont know what theyre looking at because historically there has not been education on elder abuse provided in medical training
2632386 there are relatively few medical schools that have any specialized geriatrics training and there are relatively few geriatricians
2632387 elder abuse is often hidden you dont necessarily see the bruises or the broken ribs most elder abuse clients dont have a bruise to show for it
2632388 primary care doctors dont know how to probe and dont have the time
2632389 dependent on an abuser to meet needs that otherwise would be unmet sometimes the abusive nephew is the only person who will come to the house to get the elder out of bed so she can sit in front of the television set during the day
2632390 if the caregiver suspects the patient is talking to the doctor
2632391 dont want to get involved with the legal system or the social service system
2632392 is a double edged sword alliances friendships develop between patients and the patients family and caregivers they the doctors dont want to accept a different potential reality
2632393 in some cases primary care doctors feel torn about reporting because sometimes they feel reporting may do good with regards to the patient and their relationship with the patient
2632394 could improve an elders quality of life as it relates to safety it could also adversely affect the patients quality of life
2632395 not always helpful but destructive i interviewed one doctor who said that after he reported to aps their patient almost got kicked out of their apartment
2632396 some physicians tend to dismiss or not identify elder abuse as a problem that they can do anything about
2632397 tend to minimize the role of physicians in addressing elder abuse some of them feel if they do something its not going to make any difference other physicians feel its more important to address the medical issues the patient comes in with rather than the elder abuse issues
2632398 doctors need to be made aware that if they have a suspicion of financial exploitation patient abuse or neglect they must report
2632399 doctors need to become better educated when dealing with elderly patients to recognize that the bruises they see on an elderly person might not be from rolling over in bed
2632400 most of the abuse occurs in the process of giving care to needy frail older people who are not easy to take care of
2632401 will lead to a discussion of abuse questions such as how are things going at home
2632402 reaching the point where youre trusted as a health care professional takes time coaxing building a lot of trust creating a safe environment and having a skill set to talk
2632403 most people dont walk into a doctors office because they are victims of elder abuse they have depression weight problems nightmares sleeping problems gi problems neck and muscle pain rather than bruises and many times they are not asked questions about these things
2632404 the police yielding to pressure to disrupt the half day bar council forum on conversion to islam at 10 am in kuala lumpur today is a most adverse reflection on law and order as well as religious harmony in malaysia on the eve of the 51st merdeka anniversary
2632405 malaysia has failed a major test in nation building to demonstrate that we are shaping up to be a more civil society where sensitive issues of inter faith problems can be discussed in a mature and responsible manner to promote national unity and religious harmony in the country
2632406 are there any cabinet ministers who are prepared to raise this episode at wednesdays cabinet meeting to uphold the right to have such forums to be held
2632407 this is unlikely considering the public stand that has been taken by umno leaders including deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razak home minister datuk seri syed hamid albar minister in the prime ministers department datuk seri ahmad zahid hamidi and the education minister datuk seri hishammuddin hussein demanding that the bar council forum should be called off
2632408 if discussing our constitution and our laws is equivalent to
2632409 well it appears that this type of thuggish and loutish behaviour is unfortunately not only limited to umno youth
2632410 its just a difficult time but in some cases its proved to be an opportunity to sit down and work things out
2632411 our primary interest was in getting a contract a contract we could defend and the community could accept
2632412 we analyzed our contract and we knew where we were spending dollars that we wanted to spend differently we told the teachers you have to help us find the money and to their credit they did
2632413 we went in with the mindset that there were significant fiscal restraints on the district and we educated our members about that
2632414 we told them to be mindful of the economic and political climate you know my teachers have the same bills as everyone else so they understand
2632415 we knew what the issues were before negotiations began because of all our meetings over the years and we were able to keep tally of the interests of the school committee as well as the teachers
2632416 there is a lot of familiarity with mary anne roll and mary ann mccomiskey
2632417 we respect each others opinion we want to come to common ground everyone agreed were here for the students
2632418 but it was an area we could cut that would not directly affect students
2632419 we wanted a thinner contract and we didnt get that
2632420 there is a lot of language that goes back 25 to 30 years and no one even knows where it came from anymore the public sometimes thinks we are negotiating a three year contract were not were renegotiating a 30 year contract and that doesnt happen all at once
2632421 there is a decreasing amount of funding that communities can seek under the states property tax cap
2632422 and by not appropriating the entire amount they can under law they are decreasing their ability to fund schools in the future
2632423 what lincoln shows is that both sides were willing in a tough financial environment to find a way to make sure that they reach an agreement so there is no work stoppage and programs continue and that teachers got what both sides thought was fair
2632424 districts have to get creative because both sides are realizing there is just not a lot of movement to be had on the money
2632425 s lo es el segundo intento fallido por desarrollar una vacuna mantenemos la esperanza porque hay varios proyectos en marcha y porque millones de vidas pueden ser salvadas

2632431 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government is prepared to assist in any way
2632432 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock
2632433 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one of our family suffers a loss we all
2632434 our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2632435 i am on board with senator obamas campaign and i am proud to be working here
2632436 its never easy to lose especially when you poured so much of your time and effort into a campaign like that
2632437 but once we had a nominee there was no doubt in my mind that i wanted to go work for barack obama because the issues at stake in this election are too big
2632438 the best way to fight for what hillary wants and what i want for my children is to work tirelessly for barack obama
2632439 especially if youre young this is your first presidential and youre reading stories about supposed lists and the godfather rigmarole about the price of disloyalty in this business youre going to wonder if that will affect you
2632440 especially during the primary here it was about making the case for her as a candidate it was never in my mind about being against barack obama
2632441 it was clear he wanted to get the ball rolling as soon as possible but he also knew he should give me a few days
2632442 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes

2632447 for the first time the uae sends two women athletes they are the presidents daughters but im sure that has nothing to do with why theyre here
2632448 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes
2632449 im going to vote for evo because hes always going to support us
2632450 there was death before in chapare and now we have peace
2632451 the coca leaf pays for our studies our clothes our health
2632452 what would be the services how many entities any value objects
2632453 two police officers and a security guard were injured and two police cars were destroyed
2632454 theyd show up at some small theater or a church or wherever they were supposed to play and people would be lined up outside the doors to get in and theyd be saying are you going to play the apartment
2632455 and theyd say no were going to play bach and tchaikovsky

2632463 the individual that he spoke to didnt want anything to do with the plot and immediately told the colleges public safety department

2632469 sitting under a tree with his friends when a military jeep drove up and the army shot him a live bullet pierced his head the boy died immediately
2632470 moussa tried to run away but his sandal slipped off after he stumbled over a part of the fence

2632502 rachel was there when you werent so dont say anything about her
2632503 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2632504 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2632505 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2632506 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2632507 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking
2632508 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2632509 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2632510 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2632511 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2632512 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2632513 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2632514 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2632515 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2632516 que da una nueva dimension al hecho amoroso al centrarse fundamentalmente en el egoismo de nuetro material gen tico
2632517 si no se tratara mas que de la satisfacci n de una necesidad imperiosa serie indiferente la hermosura o fealdad del otro individuo
2632518 subita sorpresa del alma que la lleva a considerar con atenci n los objetos que le parecen inusuales y extraordinarios
2632519 el amor bien puede derivar de un sentimiento generoso pero bien pronto lo corrompe el gusto por la propiedad
2632520 el deseo del bien que produce y lleva al conocimiento
2632521 con un cierto toque latino ambas suponen un giro m s liviano y luminoso al desarollo del lbum que cierra con
2632522 otro tema largo en tono r amp b y soul reposado con voz y coros
2632523 no you cannot climb on the ceramic horse so fuck off
2632524 when my arm was broken at 4 that was paramount
2632525 i should have told the doctor but the stress was of such magnitude that i thought it would never happen again that shed never lose it again
2632526 they the perpetrators pick on a child that they can control and get away with she picked on me because i was shy and i believe that she thought i was slow and i was clumsy now you take these elements and you can control the situation so she picked on me and a relationship formed
2632527 more difficult now that im 34 than when i was a teenager
2632528 then i was used to it it was right there i didnt know how bad my abuse was until after i was an adult until after i was a parent
2632529 i did have some therapy involved but my therapy was a lot of self resilience
2632530 a lot of people ask me well dave what turned it around for you what was the one element that switched and i go back to when i was burned on the gas stove
2632531 i had to trick her very quickly and force her to hit me so that the clock would run out so that she wouldnt burn me i knew later in the bottom of the basement that if i could do that one thing what else could i possibly achieve
2632532 so it all goes back to the gas stove i wanted more
2632533 if you take that on a more extended level you think if i can survive death several times how come i cant write a book how come i cant save a child how come i cant make myself into a fighter so you just take these little things and sure im different from other people im very focused very driven and im pretty good
2632534 if it doesnt stop with me right now what happens to my son
2632535 if i dont forgive my mom im just as guilty as she my grandmother never forgave her father my mother never forgave my grandmother its got to stop with me period because if i carry around all of this hate and baggage its going to destroy me my wife and son
2632536 there was a time when i didnt forgive her obviously when i was a child it was always why why why survivors of abuse are dysfunctional theyre like robots they want to know why did this person do this to me and did this person ever have any affection for me and as a young foster kid my social workers would say no dont worry about it but its like a program youve got to run the program in order to find out about it once they find out about the program they can move beyond it
2632537 if anything i just feel so sorry for this woman i mean if she had been raised now 1 she would have been reported much earlier which means 2 she could have gotten some help which means 3 we would have been reunited as a family to be pretty frank i really wish i had a mommy and a daddy
2632538 was there such a thing as child abuse back then
2632539 i remember i asked her mother was there ever a chance that you could have um and she knew what i was getting at and she said david honey i could have killed you hundreds of times just like that the only problem i had was where to hide its body
2632540 how can they miss you if they dont even know that youre there no one had seen me in years
2632541 there have been some very favorable changes in terms of the victim theres an extension of the time period that a criminal case may be brought against a person who has molested or sexually assaulted a child now a criminal complaint may be filed within one year of a complaint to a law enforcement agency by a person of any age alleging that he or she while under the age of 18 years was the victim of a crime
2632542 the funding is very limited they have to have a case that they feel they can prosecute and win if it looks as though the witness might crumble under cross examination or if the details are too sketchy or if evidence is missing then they have to make a very difficult decision on whether or not to prosecute
2632543 not all of them pan out not all of them are legitimate
2632544 in fact children are in danger we intervene to try to change the situation so that they wont be in danger
2632545 and to that extent what we do is we go in we investigate we offer services and we try to keep the family intact if the child is in imminent danger we do not have authority to remove the child law enforcement has to remove the child
2632546 little ones who dont bring snacks and arent independent enough to help themselves
2632547 being left after school not being picked up thats usually a big clue that this little guy is on his own
2632548 often one of the clues that were looking for not necessarily assuming its abuse but assuming that something traumatic is happening is when a child just changes when his demeanor his energy level his ability to make eye contact his ability to follow through with his work when all that diminishes its like a signal to our teachers
2632549 we have a full range in our district from complete neglect and abandonment to sexual abuse
2632550 i used to work in a child emergency shelter and the very worst the most damaged kids were severe neglect kids they dont even know that theyre human i have seen a lot of things and you never see the stuff you see in the eyes of a kid whos suffered severe neglect because its so warped its so distorted of the deepest things in humanity its disorienting to your soul
2632551 its just amazing that this man made it out of there thats the other amazing thing about child abuse that there are some kids who can make it out theres some robustness to the psyche or something
2632552 the state of california invested maybe 100 000 in me
2632553 its not a steppingstone its the job ive always wanted its really neat to be involved in the formative years of a historic court body
2632554 he has convicted some of the worst offenders weve ever prosecuted
2632555 but perhaps jacks strongest trait is the fact that he is scrupulously fair and honest
2632556 i was paying 4 27 a gallon a few weeks ago i dont know how long it will last but ill take it
2632557 i hope it keeps going down i was putting 50 of gas into my tiny sedan
2632558 if the country doesnt get off our oil dependency were doomed and so is the planet
2632559 healthy people are the greatest asset of any nation and molecular screening promises better management of health risk
2632560 this will lead to specific interventions aimed at reducing risks including adjustments for nutrition lifestyle and environment
2632561 a principal advantage of linspire its codec licensing agreement with microsoft no longer applies
2632562 with the linspire acquisition we had three desktop brands and two distinct code bases from joint discussions with our respective engineering teams it made eminent sense to combine our efforts with a single code base and two brands
2632563 freespire is returning to debian because we need to build all of our desktop products upon a single code base
2632564 xandros has always worked closely with the debian community where the emphasis is stability and consistency over the bleeding edge besides its not that big a switch since ubuntu is based on debian as well
2632565 linspire accomplished what no other distro has ever done it got a gnu linux distro pre installed on computers sold in a major retailer
2632566 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2632567 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2632568 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2632569 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2632570 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2632571 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2632572 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2632573 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2632574 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2632575 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2632576 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2632577 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2632578 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2632579 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2632580 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2632581 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth
2632582 climate change is a robust area of science and there is plenty that is still being debated and new discoveries are still being made
2632583 it is a topic that will keep attracting different opinions from enthusiasts and from bloggers they are a minority but they are proving to be a very vocal group
2632584 most scientists are adamant that any assessment of climate change based on only 10 years of data is not only meaningless but reckless
2632585 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2632586 david evans former consultant to the australian greenhouse office says hansens giss is unreliable because it is the only measurement agency that relies almost wholly on land based data instead of satellites
2632587 most scientists are adamant that any assessment of climate change based on only 10 years of data is not only meaningless but reckless
2632588 what the bloggers have succeeded in doing is to highlight that measuring climate change is an evolving science but their success has been at the margins only so far they have failed to prove that these discrepancies negate the broader core arguments about the trends of global warming
2632589 ive experienced many terrible things in life a few of which actually happened
2632590 youre merely going through a natural body change but nothing is wrong with you physically
2632591 give sunrise series more than 13 episodes to set themselves up and get awesome
2632592 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals
2632593 it tastes i think a bit like this one berry in finland
2632594 nu i asa ca or sa fie gata toate pana la targ
2632595 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
2632596 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
2632597 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
2632598 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
2632599 he life was took and it was took so violently and for to be so sweet it just hurts
2632600 i dont know anybody thats human that can shoot and kill people and then lay down and go to sleep
2632601 every night its just like gunfire and it seems like police dont even come to the cause because its just like regular
2632602 theyre doing a lot of surveillance on the west side i think the suburbs should get more surveillance as well
2632603 im gonna pray for them and that it might not happen in my time or when i want it to happen but god will avenge my sons death
2632604 i was just like one of his biggest fans he was just a phenomenal talent and the fact that we have lost this great superstar who is straight out of englewood south side just like me we grew up like three blocks away from each other
2632605 you can still rise above your environment and still become somebody and do good in the world
2632606 his legacy will be something that he told me several times himself and that is never give up
2632607 he worked a lot of different jobs and was doing comedy on the streets and small clubs
2632608 he was well into his 30s before his career took off
2632609 in the broader picture he was really a strong strong comedy star
2632610 i thank god he gave us him as long as he was here
2632611 i think this is a fitting tribute to who he was
2632612 bernies spirit is throughout this entire parade he was chicago
2632613 he will be missed he was a great comedian condolences out to the family
2632614 our prayers are without bernie mac one of our brothers is a family member of bernie mac and we just like to send out love and support to his family at this time of their bereavement
2632615 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2632616 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2632617 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2632618 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2632619 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2632620 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2632621 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2632622 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2632623 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2632624 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2632625 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2632626 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2632627 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2632628 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2632629 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2632630 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2632631 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2632632 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2632633 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2632634 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2632635 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
2632636 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
2632637 one to show my respect for the people of china and two to cheer on the us team
2632638 that reflects where we are in the economic downturn we feel that it is right to do to prepare for future losses we do expect our losses to increase given where we are in the economic cycle
2632639 we have priced very keenly and we plan to continue to price very keenly because we are winning a large number of new customers
2632640 lending and deposit growth is well ahead of the market profit before credit expenses has more than doubled even though funding costs were much higher and we continued to invest in new branches
2632641 weve substantially increased credit provisions reflecting the economic downturn and the outlook for continuing challenging conditions however our overall asset quality remains sound
2632642 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2632643 to be honest i really didnt feel that great going into the ready room i started getting these chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more excited i was pretty emotional after that race

2632645 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2632646 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2632647 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2632648 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2632649 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2632650 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2632651 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2632652 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2632656 thats all youre thinking about you want to catch that guy everything else goes away
2632657 i took him down to the ground right here in this grass dirt area
2632658 right here i kind of like full blown tackled him and i put my arms around i took him to the ground saw where his hands were and handcuffed him
2632659 in the end while some athletes were fortunate to celebrate their achievements on the medal stand others were able to fulfill their dreams simply by competing but the captivating and unforgettable moments of those two weeks in beijing will last forever relive all the drama and excitement from the pageantry of the opening ceremony to the extinguishment of the olympic flame all captured on the official olympic dvd from nbc sports
2632660 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2632661 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2632662 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2632663 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2632664 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2632665 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2632666 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2632667 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2632668 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2632669 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived
2632670 they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination
2632671 going to meet the principals basically to update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2632672 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the interparty dialogue
2632673 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2632674 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2632675 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2632676 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2632677 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2632678 sienna and he are in love they are living together in la everyone knows about her and accepts her
2632679 he should have announced his separation a lot earlier than he did hed been sleeping on friends couches for six months
2632680 china and japan they will fight for gold and silver and the other teams will fight for the bronze
2632681 although we made some small mistakes we did a great job in general we are competing at the right time and right place with support from the people of our country
2632682 there was indeed a lot of pressure i was nervous
2632683 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did
2632684 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room
2632685 i believe with his enormous reserves and physical armoring sean resisted the drug
2632686 thats what they are looking for the ultimate confrontation they want a smack
2632687 some of the products that would typically be purchased at a supermarket or club store in bulk quantities were seeing more customers buy those products throughout the month at a 7 eleven
2632688 its important to add destination appeal so that shoppers think of them not only as convenience
2632689 adding that second layer can help them in the future

2632691 in the blink of an eye my whole life changed
2632692 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2632693 i telephoned him president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2632694 i explained to him how it could have serious consequences how it could lead to military engagements death and destruction and that it would be best to reconsider his decision but he was stubborn
2632695 it was our duty to remind him of his humanitarian responsibilities to try to dissuade him but he chose to ignore us just as in the same manner he tried to destroy the country and block its institutions
2632696 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2632697 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before
2632698 and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2632699 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2632700 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2632701 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2632702 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2632703 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2632704 people say politics is the art of the possible but they are wrong politics is the art of creating the possible and what is possible is what people believe is possible
2632705 its so hard for me because im so open to hold back
2632706 in spelling the english language was assimilating the consequences of having a civil service of french scribes who paid little attention to the traditions of english spelling that had developed in anglo saxon times not only did french
2632707 any desire to standardize would also have been hindered by the great english vowel shift which took place in the early 1400s before the shift a word like loud would have been pronounced lood name as nahm leaf as layf mice as mees
2632708 the renewed interest in classical languages and cultures which formed part of the ethos of the renaissance had introduced a new perspective into spelling etymology etymology is the study of the history of words and there was a widespread view that words should show their history in the way they were spelled these werent classicists showing off there was a genuine belief that it would help people if they could see the original latin in a latin derived english word so someone added a b to the word typically spelled det dett or dette in middle english because the source in latin was debitum and it became debt and caught on similarly an o was added to peple because it came from populum we find both poeple and people before the latter became the norm an s was added to ile and iland because of latin insula so we now have island there are many more such cases some people nowadays find it hard to understand why there are so many silent letters of this kind in english it is because other people thought they were helping
2632709 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in

2632713 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2632714 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish

2632756 in your interview i was but disturbed at your prevailing pessimism about global warming etc etc violence i have also been dark about various issues but i want to ask how do you reconcile this with the urgency and the enormous lifefulness and energy of a lot of what you are doing
2632757 but i can protest against the latter at least as if there were some hope as far as the energy goes thats physiology for the most part it keeps me going even through depression
2632758 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2632759 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2632760 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out

2632856 its best to avoid colorful clip art or pixelated pictures
2632857 the card should have a well thought out design and be easy to read
2632858 before you sit down at your pc you should try and imagine what you want the card to look like
2632859 you should remember that everyone has access to these same pre made cards
2632860 that makes these business card packages from office suppliers attractive

2632879 he was a friend of guys who liked to party a friend of spiritual people a friend of kids a friend of senior adults
2632880 everyone would say i want a piece of what this guy has
2632881 he wasnt the prototypical homecoming king blown back sandy blonde hair and 14 inch biceps
2632882 people loved him for the size of his heart not his external qualities
2632883 andy set the standard for us in character leadership self control and self sacrifice

2632894 the belief that gender gaps in math and science fields are largely due to discrimination support for affirmative action and belief that discrimination is a key cause of racial inequities in american society generally members of this cohort see race and gender as fundamental
2632895 this suggests that within a cultures internal context there may be observable
2632896 in which we define a socially acceptable space deemed appropriate for our youth to learn about the world where a necessary media extraction of culture from its source has allowed interfering influences of cultural intimacy and sensitivity to alter the faithfulness of the virtualised disney experience
2632897 brilliance melded with polish and a touch of gritty focus more magnifying glass than prism a cactus is sharp in many directions but spends its life alone distant and irrelevant a pencil is sharp and to the point and it creates legends delineates logic and brings the beauty of the living world to that of the once living i would dedicate myself to being a pencil but 2b or not 2b that is the question

2632901 the market in general is repricing not only the euro dollar interest rate spread but reassessing what other major central banks will be doing thats the key driver for the market today
2632902 the trend for the dollar is changing quickly we are in a situation now in which the ecb is expected to start cutting interest rates while the federal reserve will have to start hiking
2632903 that combined with the drop in oil and other commodities is giving a big boost to the dollar this is not just a technical move fundamentals are now in place to support a sustained dollar rally
2632904 when you look at ecb rate expectations the overnight index swap rate shows minus 30 basis points 12 months from now for the bank of england its minus 50 basis points
2632905 the fed is expected to raise 70 basis points 12 months from now

2632911 i mean who could put up those numbers nobody will ever duplicate that

2632941 i was just going home for a day off see the kids and i got the phone call it caught me off guard after the deadline passes you kind of catch your breath a little bit and see whats going to happen ive spent a few days in the air i feel all right im just excited about being here
2632942 all of a sudden one day youre not and the next day you are in a playoff chase it kind of lights a fire under you youre ready to go out there and get after them
2632943 theyre always in the game anything can happen theyre out there to win a ballgame do whatever they need to do thats how you get into the playoffs
2632944 he doesnt give up a lot of extra base hits he throws ground balls we have a nice balance now between the righties and the lefties so id say primarily against righties he can come in and start an inning if i like the matchups he could come in during an inning if were looking for a double play
2632945 when sound speeds up it becomes light and when sound slows down it becomes matter
2632946 when i get some money im gonna buy me some time cant fight your wars till im finished with mine
2632947 hes probably one of the best guys on and off the field that ive ever met hes a great family man great for the community and always did his family and everyone proud he helped me out tremendously when i was up there from a leadership standpoint and a teammate standpoint hes one of the best ive been around obviously hes the consummate leader hes always in the leader hes a great teacher and hes like having another coach on the field
2632948 un voyage de 1 000 km commence toujours par un pas
2632949 what do you want to be when you grow up
2632950 surfs flat no waves no surf no fun for a surfer
2632951 it is sheer folly to expect justice from the unprincipled
2632952 justice is itself the great standing policy of civil society and any eminent departure from it under any circumstances lies under the suspicion of being no policy at all
2632953 nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
2632954 it is not if we will be extremists but what kind of extremists will we be
2632955 a man should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong which is but saying in other words that he is wiser today than he was yesterday
2632956 he that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill our antagonist is our helper
2632957 everything we shut our eyes to everything we run away from everything we deny denigrate or despise serves to defeat us in the end what seems nasty painful evil can become a source of beauty joy and strength if faced with an open mind
2632958 its like a whole other world where you can smell the food but you cant touch the silverware
2632959 we established the fastball early and pounded the strike zone
2632960 then they got aggressive so we went to the breaking ball and got a lot of popups
2632961 its tough to come up with stuff to say every night
2632962 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2632963 i thought wed get some whacks at him the second time around
2632964 he kept us off balance youve got to tip your cap to him this is the second time hes thrown well against us
2632965 when you make them hit the ball and you dont walk anybody you can be very effective
2632966 one run isnt going to get you a win unless you get a shutout and we havent seen too many of those lately
2632967 barack obamas faith and his spiritual journey not only are shaping this election but also as you tell the story and reflect on it capture many of the trends that are most powerful and transforming in this age
2632968 the younger voters coming on line tend to be postmodern theologically to the extent they are theological at all and tend to lean leftward in their politics
2632969 i think obama is very clear that he first went to church to get connected to a church not so much out of a spiritual search but because people he was working with in the south side of chicago challenged him that he would be more successful if he had some connections to church some connection to faith but i think in time he was captured by the gospel
2632970 i think what is diminishing is a secular approach to politics and whats arising is a faith based approach to politics and now i think we have the opportunity in this country for the great debate between a right leaning limited government low taxes anti abortion type of faith based politics and then the more left leaning version of that on the other side
2632971 the whole world comes to pisa for one thing only the tower
2632972 everyone just cares about their own backyard or their own bell tower
2632973 would represent a great pain for me and for the city
2632974 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2632975 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2632976 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2632977 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2632978 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2632979 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2632980 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2632981 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2632982 i should have known that people would feel that way
2632983 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2632984 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2632985 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2632986 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2632987 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2632988 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2632989 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2632990 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2632991 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2632992 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2632993 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2632994 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2632995 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2632996 making the band 4 winner awarded a solo contract with bad boy records visiting the long island neighborhood where he grew up
2632997 only one of us could make it over the wall
2632998 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2632999 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2633000 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2633001 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2633002 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2633003 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2633004 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2633005 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2633006 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2633007 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2633008 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2633009 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2633010 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2633011 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2633012 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2633013 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2633014 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2633015 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2633016 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2633023 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2633024 id ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me
2633025 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label

2633029 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2633030 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2633031 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
2633032 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
2633033 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star
2633034 im like life aint fair chill baby girl my girl is here
2633035 getting the crowd excited for the second sequel to one of the cornerstones of his lauded catalog of classics rumors of the album began this january when but jays reps denied that the song was new
2633036 i walk into the dressing room and kanyes like lets do a record lets do this im like cmon man but you know i couldnt tell him no its his show that was the idea he wanted to perform a new record
2633037 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature
2633038 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2633039 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2633040 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2633041 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2633042 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2633043 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2633044 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2633045 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2633046 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2633047 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2633048 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2633049 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2633050 um procedimento padr o ao liberar combust vel para atingir o peso ideal para o pouso

2633054 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2633055 i paid an agent for a work pass earlier this year and now i do not know how to reach him
2633056 this new operation launched by the government appears to be more serious because of the present political situation
2633057 political parties are calling for more action by the authorities to solve the illegal immigrant problem and that is why i believe it will be like 2002 again
2633058 that is why i feel rather edgy now i have made arrangements for my wife and children to leave in a day or two as they are here illegally
2633059 i will join them in nunukan kalimantan early next week
2633060 i will return maybe in a month or two but i will be using my own passport
2633061 by then i will try to secure a more steady job and work pass
2633062 because of that i was only allowed to return to sabah after six months
2633063 i entered sabah illegally and managed to secure myself the document for rm2 000 through a friend in putatan
2633064 they do it out of desperation violation of the conditions of their permits is one of the most common offences committed by foreigners
2633065 in sabah we do not allow foreigners to be employed as grass cutters
2633066 yet so often you see them working by the roadside

2633069 listen up everyone the lord our god is completely stable and trustworthy for life it is to our
2633070 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2633071 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2633072 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2633073 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2633074 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2633075 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2633076 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2633077 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2633078 sekalian aja buncit adik gw trus adik paling kecil si dewi

2633081 while bruce was in hong kong filming in late 1971 or early 1972 he had his weight equipment and training gear shipped to him
2633082 he was constantly training when he watched tv or went to the movies he conditioned his knuckles when he was driving he worked the hand grips if he walked to a bookstore and came to a hill he always ran he never wasted time
2633083 lee felt you had no business being in the martial arts if you werent in shape
2633084 if you werent in shape you couldnt be 100 percent efficient
2633085 he was constantly looking for ways to improve including weight training and isometrics
2633086 he felt it was important to have definition but he did not feel you had to overboard
2633087 he did not feel it was necessary to develop large muscles on the other hand strength and definition enhanced certain functions such as kicking and punching
2633088 a lot of the time he read books and analyzed different arts
2633089 he had a keen eye and an analytical mind he did a lot of researching
2633090 its really good its effective but it is also very difficult although bruce lifted a lot of weight most people cant i remember trying to lift what he used and i couldnt even hold it
2633091 and its good when youre in close range because there isnt much room for your wrist to travel this is a good drill for the one inch punch
2633092 it was one of lees favorite drills because it built speed and punching power at different ranges
2633093 this drill enables you to develop explosive power and to close the gap more efficiently
2633094 do these real fast and do as many as you can
2633095 i think there are a lot of factors but i think it was his drive
2633096 for example he always told me you had to put 100 effort into everything you did he said when you throw a punch put everything into it dont just go through the motions to this day i remember that and its very important to me
2633097 kok elu jahat banget sih kmaren ama gw dua kali lagi

2633100 union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2633101 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2633102 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2633103 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2633104 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2633105 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2633106 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2633254 ive harped on this issue since 2005 the year that apple first started selling movies and tv shows on itunes since then itunes has become the dominant marketplace for legal movie sales and rentals in june apple said itunes users were renting or purchasing 50 000 movies a day apples rivals like amazon unbox movielink and cinemanow have never disclosed how many movies they sell and rent but my belief is that theyre bit players so how do you get your movie sold on itunes

2633311 the great forces of morality had nothing to say about it
2633312 that was as good enthusiasm and energy on both sides of the ball as ive been around
2633313 you have to realize that we had a pretty extensive practice before we started scrimmaging practice was as crisp as i have seen it asack added a 29 yard touchdown run on the evening while rookie wide receiver johnny williams led the pass receiving corps with six catches for 56 yards quarterback thaddeus lewis was eight for 20 through the air for 57 yards while running back clifford harris gained 20 yards on the ground and added two receptions for an additional 30 yards glenn williams and oglesby were credited with one quarterback sack apiece nick maggio had a good day kicking the ball that was encouraging i thought our tackling was really crisp particularly for our first scrimmage maybe far better than i thought it would be i thought we took care of the football for the most part it was good to see a few freshmen contribute

2633315 to explore the need for a more substantive truth commission along the lines of the south african truth and reconciliation commission in order to combat the endemic malaise of corruption and mis governance in nigeria
2633316 unless a society exposes itself to the truth it can harbour no possibility of reconciliation reunification and trust for settlement to be solid and durable it must be based on truth
2633317 although the truth cannot really in itself dispense justice it does put an end to many a continued injustice
2633318 i therefore say to those who wear legalistic blinkers who argue that immunity would be an affront to justice that they simply do not understand the nature of the negotiated revolution that we have lived through we must deliberately sacrifice the formal trappings of justice the courts and trials for an even greater good truth

2633322 years ago you got the fbi out there because they did a lot of the forensic stuff
2633323 now you place a call to the state police crime lab and they come out
2633324 local departments they have people that can do the same things the experts do
2633325 as it related to bank robbery they target those that are violent and target the repeaters
2633326 do you need the taskforce to come out for that one no you know who youre looking for
2633327 were always the first ones to respond but many times within the hour the fbi is there
2633328 anytime weve had a bank robbery in the past they typically respond
2633329 really i cant weigh in as far as there being a time when we sought assistance and were told sorry we dont do that anymore
2633330 i think its clear in the post 9 11 world a lot more has been put on the fbis plate and the state polices plate and local law enforcements plate
2633331 i think the allocation of resources is something every agency federal state or local has to evaluate but from our personal experience when youve needed the fbi you pick up the phone
2633332 we welcome all cooperation from the federal authorities and other departments
2633333 we do not want to put blinders on to information other agencies may possess when trying to solve the case
2633334 our philosophy is if we have information to share to help someone else solve their bank robbery or if they have information for us we will work together

2633342 people that spray it just assume its a no lose situation thats just not the case
2633343 even if we were to spray an infant on the sidewalk that shouldnt cause a reaction

2633345 we do characterize it as a temporary means of control

2633415 from the dawn of the republic americas quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of god the creator the framers of this nations founding documents drew upon this conviction when they proclaimed the self evident truth that all men are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights grounded in the laws of nature and of natures god the course of american history demonstrates the difficulties the struggles and the great intellectual and moral resolve which were demanded to shape a society that faithfully embodied these noble principles in that process which forged the soul of the nation religious beliefs were a constant inspiration and driving force as for example in the struggle against slavery and in the civil rights movement

2633470 the normative criteria for identifying a given teaching as ioum are clear enough in magisterial documents themselves to be authoritatively extended to particular teachings
2633471 a ll those things are to be believed with divine and catholic faith and which are contained in the word of god written or handed down and which the church either by a solemn judgment or by her ordinary and universal magisterium proposes for belief as having been divinely revealed
2633472 the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women
2633473 although the individual bishops do not enjoy the prerogative of infallibility they nevertheless proclaim christs doctrine infallibly whenever even though dispersed through the world but still maintaining the bond of communion among themselves and with the successor of peter and authentically teaching matters of faith and morals they are in agreement on one position as definitively to be held

2633511 the two patients with suspected bird flu have recovered and are in normal condition but as we havent received results from the laboratory they remain in the isolation room
2633512 we have taken measures since tuesday when we found strong indications of bird flu virus in some 100 chickens and ducks in several places in air batu village
2633513 we dont need to send samples from the poultry to a laboratory because its pretty clear that the cause is the bird flu virus

2633519 tuvimos un buen partido creo que siempre fuimos due os del bal n y lo pudimos reflejar en el marcador antes del partido nos dijimos que ten amos que ganar de cualquier forma para irnos a espa a tranquilos y lo conseguimos
2633520 esto es producto de un choque con hassan estamos expuestos a ello pero no pasa nada s lo me pusieron tres puntadas
2633521 fue un partido con muchos errores tuvimos la suerte de hacer los goles nosotros aprovechando dos pelotas quietas y bueno hay que mejorar para el partido que viene tuvimos otro par de chances claros pero no tuvimos suerte en la definici n pero bueno se gan contra un rival de grupo y esperamos seguir mejorando para ganar con mejor futbol

2633524 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2633525 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2633526 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2633527 i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should but then in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and started getting excited
2633528 fue un rival complicado sobre todo al inicio creo que de arranque jugamos bien despu s nos falt manejar mejor el partido y al final con el 2 0 salimos sufriendo era un partido para jugar mucho mejor
2633529 sin ser brillantes merecidamente nos adjudicamos el triunfo hay mucho por trabajar creo que en cada partido hay cosas positivas y detalles para seguir trabajando
2633530 la prioridad siempre ser mantener el cero porque te da la ventaja de hacer un gol busqu con los cambios dar rotaci n ya que tengo un plantel extenso la prioridad fue darle la rotaci n al conjunto porque hay jugadores que ven an de participar en dos partidos intensos y muchos necesitan la oportunidad de mostrarse el equipo de inicio y con los cambios me gust y seguir teniendo mucho trabajo para decidir las alineaciones en el futuro
2633531 fue clara y evidente la diferencia que hubo en el marcador fueron s lo dos jugadas a bal n parado para que nos sentenciar n el resultado creo que demostramos que en ning n momento renunciamos al objetivo de llevarnos la victoria sin embargo cuando nos hicieron el primer gol no pudimos rescatar el empate y mucho menos despu s supimos revertir el resultado
2633532 este tipo de desatenciones son las que debemos de tomar en cuenta para corregirlas durante la semana y no volver a perder por errores como estos
2633533 cuando ganamos dos partidos consecutivos no nos cre amos la gran cosa y creo que esta vez que perdimos no podemos sentir que somos los peores creo que estamos a muy buen tiempo para retomar el nivel que mostramos en las fechas anteriores ya que estamos mentalizados en sumar para la tabla de cocientes
2633534 a nadie le gusta estar en la banca pero son decisiones que uno tiene que respetar y cuando le toca entrar poner todo para hacer las cosas bien no s qu pase al regreso ser decisi n de benjam n si vuelve a la alineaci n anterior yo tengo que seguir trabajando para ganarme el lugar en el futuro
2633535 conseguir el resultado era lo m s importante el ganarle a un equipo de grupo y obtener esa ventaja moment nea todav a nos falta un poco m s de nivel creo que el equipo est para m s pero hay que seguir en el camino y poco a poco el futbol se ir soltando
2633536 lo m s importante a pesar de no jugar bien son los tres puntos antes de irnos a espa a ah tendremos la oportunidad de mostrarnos con equipos importantes habr que hacer un buen torneo all para regresar y meternos de nuevo en el torneo
2633537 no me gust el partido cometimos errores que no debimos
2633538 desafortunadamente perdimos pero tenemos que revisar dos acciones definitivas en el encuentro el gol que no dan por bueno de robert de pinho y una tarjeta roja que debi de existir tambi n tuvimos dos errores que marcaron la diferencia pero nada m s
2633539 el arbitraje siempre perjudicar a alguien en este caso nos toc a nosotros yo s considero que hay una tarjeta para marcelo carrusca que le meti una plancha a partida por el sector izquierdo
2633540 en general vi bien al equipo desgraciadamente uno parte de un plan de inicio y con un gol muy temprano es muy dif cil poder recuperarse normalmente a estas alturas un equipo como el nuestro no debi de haber recibido la anotaci n en ese instante
2633541 no me puedo ir tranquilo cuando pierdes no puedes estar tranquilo no me gust el partido cometimos errores que no debimos

2633549 i think that it is understandable that everyone in hawaii is excited about having someone that is born who grew up here running for the president of the united states
2633550 but this is not american idol this is not voting for your favorite or the most popular this is making an important decision on who should lead our nation
2633551 of course i have strong feelings that sen mccain would be better for hawaii better for america and better for our world
2633552 i think he has such a long proven record of being able to work across party lines
2633553 he doesnt just talk about it but has done it over and over again
2633554 i also think that he would be better for the defense establishment here in hawaii his father of course used to be the head of pacific command
2633555 our military installations here in hawaii are so important they are important to our national security they are also important to the economy of hawaii
2633556 this book is an extraordinary achievement that will stand as the definitive account of the desperate avoidable cultural tragedy of iraq for many years to come
2633557 july 22 2008 has now been issued there are several things to note
2633558 a fragmentary marble funerary stele with a warrior and young man dating to the 4th century bce
2633559 fragment of a grave stele with a warrior and a youth
2633560 must have been added as a separate piece of marble
2633561 warrior differs from the attic norm not only in the rendering of his drapery but also in certain details of dress
2633562 very different from the complex tubular style current in athens during the late fifth and early fourth century
2633563 reaches to the middle of the warriors upper arm with a wide opening that extends to the level of his elbow at the end of the stele
2633564 no ready parallel to the chiton depicted here comes to mind
2633565 the warriors lower arm is slightly advanced and it is unlikely that the hand was empty he might be imagined holding a phiale or a dagger
2633566 young men posed like this youth are usually shown alone reaching down to a pet or a small servant boy but it cannot be ascertained whether the youth here was accompanied
2633567 the unusual details of the warriors dress and the plain flat rendering of his drapery suggest that this stele was not carved in an attic workshop
2633568 the stele seems to lack a certain clarity in the organization of its forms that is a hallmark of most attic work
2633569 until a telling parallel for this particular relief is found it is not possible to be more precise about its place of origin

2633609 casualties of the incident may still rise xinhua reported citing witnesses who
2633610 with these special circumstances and the special background of the eve of the beijing olympic games hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities
2633611 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2633612 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvring
2633613 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2633614 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2633615 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2633616 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2633617 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2633618 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2633619 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2633620 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2633621 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2633622 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2633623 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2633624 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2633625 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2633626 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2633627 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2633628 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2633636 today we above 200 activists from tyc are protesting against the brutal occupation of tibet by china and the hosting of the most prestigious sporting event worldwide in a country which lacks human spirit and looks down upon democracy and fundamental rights
2633637 the 2008 olympics shouldnt have been offered to the only last dangerous communist regime of china on the basis of their human rights record and particularly tibet issue we came here for tibet independent and chinese and ioc authorities politicized the olympic games and torches tibetans are get killed if they protest or to voice for the truth of tibet the real terrorist is china not tyc
2633638 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2633639 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying
2633640 we had all been wondering what we were going to do to mark the twenty year milestone in the biohazard history and it seemed like it was long overdue even though we are all busy with many different projects as well as other careers and music projects it has been surprisingly painless to get everyone together we had our first real jam three weeks ago and it was really amazingly tight considering it had been such a long time the longest we had ever gone without playing together our former manager scott suggested to me that i hook up with bobby hambel guitar and we do a reunion he was definitely integral in getting us all together we think that since biohazard sold nearly four million albums worldwide and has performed in virtually every corner of the earth lots of fans will come out to relive the even more famous live show get a t shirt stage dive or just reminisce
2633641 i hope those people really did need help and that they werent just trying to lure someone away to kill them this got all of us freaked out the following ensued

2633645 we needed another tourism outlet for this area and this is it
2633646 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2633647 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2633648 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2633649 it is clear the situation is dire i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2633650 diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia
2633651 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately

2633654 i dreamt about this day since i was a little girl on a ranch in alaska
2633655 it was relaxed and romantic i wore a traditional wedding gown and diamonds and he wore jeans and a button down shirt tys definitely my perfect prince
2633656 we both have been so blessed in our lives were lucky to have each other and look forward to starting a family together
2633657 she looked beautiful her dress is gorgeous the ring is gorgeous they cant be happier
2633658 i always say hes a stand up guy in a world of flakes
2633659 you never have to guess with him and that reliability is really comforting especially for somebody as capricious as myself
2633660 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2633661 the grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of our god stands forever
2633662 we really need to be careful not to humiliate people with our charity
2633663 but doing the truth in charity we may in all things grow up in him who is the head even christ

2633665 he put on a really solid performance and were going to sadly miss him
2633666 the players have got some opportunities to show their respect for him the way we go about it the next three weeks
2633667 they collingwood made us look slow and inept at times but we know were better than that
2633668 theres a few things we need to fix but we need to do them quickly and move on
2633669 the aim is to keep improving and for a fair period over the last six weeks we think weve done that
2633670 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2633671 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2633672 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2633673 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2633674 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2633675 i am pretty happy about that that was a pretty emotional race today
2633676 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through i wasnt really happy to turn and see all three of us together at the 200 metres point
2633677 i wasnt really comfortable with that close a race i normally have more of a gap
2633678 i made my breaststroke a bit stronger and the freestyle was all downhill
2633679 i looked up and saw him he waved the flag and nodded his head that was a cool feeling to have the president here and to say congratulations
2633680 i thought it would be a 3 41 time that would win it he did a great job
2633681 its no big surprise he has been improving steadily over the last few years and he swam the sort of time i wanted
2633682 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2633683 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2633684 according to some reports several russian ships are patrolling near the port of poti and are blocking ships from entering the port with grain and fuel supplies necessary for georgia
2633685 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2633686 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2633687 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2633688 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2633689 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2633690 after undergoing approximately eight hours of surgery yesterday afternoon and evening she is in a critical but stable condition at a beijing hospital
2633691 this would be very generous you could hardly ask for more
2633692 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2633693 the embroidery does not follow the order of the plan nor any order recognizable as that of the events they have all lived through one day horses falling in battle the next king william and his brothers commissioning ships to be built a morning on a saxon peasants pursued by norman knights wielding whips and afternoon on the exploits of harold fighting alongside william against conan of brittany heroically rescuing a man from drowning in a river writhing with giant eels some days working upside down before switching sides with your partner and seeing the strange world of wool and linen right way up again these partnerships ever changing the women switching from one frame to another as they complete a figure or a scene
2633694 yet the embroidery is real enough the wool stinking of the sheeps piss used to set the dyes the linen taut as drumskins in the frames men and horse ships and city walls emerging from the tangle of needles and thread and charcoal lines as the world came out of chaos though a great deal more slowly it can take a week or more to complete a single suit of mail overlapping the stitches so densely that you can almost imagine the woolen replica would offer as much protection as the real thing building up ring by ring the fishscale effect that sometimes reminds gytha of accompanying her father to the early morning market his great red gentle hands lifting the gills of the fish to test their freshness and you can eke out the process further by snapping needles rubbing out sister jeans guidelines so mistakes ensue and have to be unpicked
2633695 last winter gytha lost track of the time she and margaret spent embroidering the image of a norman abbey called mont saint michel its dainty arches balanced on a folded hill of sage green and ochre its roof ridged with yellow gold a place impossible outside the imagination of god yet built by these two with their aching backs and smarting fingers stiff with cold their tips swollen with chillblains like overripe plums even if they could work the complete cycle of the hours without stopping for food or rest the project might take so many years its patron would be in the grave before it was complete

2633697 we took a chance i cant believe how close we were

2633701 you know obviously with a 78 point lead now i think its pretty healthy but as you can see tonight anything can happen
2633702 obviously weve got to be happy with the third especially with the season weve had well take it
2633703 i think tonight was a night we had one of the cars to win we tried to play traffic as best we could and we were able to overtake dixon twice but it didnt pay off
2633704 white panties i tried tampax i used the biggest hunkiest sanitary pad known to man i called them 5 day turtle neck sanitary pads and i went through

2633708 teenagers today have no concept of a world that is not connected via the internet how they live and operate in that connected world using collaborative social networking platforms and creating and sharing content that they manage tag and recommend to their peers can provide enterprises with some valuable lessons to apply within their own organisations
2633709 i am pretty happy about that that was a pretty emotional race today
2633710 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through i wasnt really happy to turn and see all three of us together at the 200 metres point

2633717 when i invented the web i thought of it as an infrastructure i designed the web as a foundation for many things
2633718 the losers are likely to be those companies that try to make money by pouring old media wine into the new web bottles the winners will be the players that invent new ways to tap into what the web brings to the party instant feedback instant analysis and the collective wisdom of a billion users

2633721 the information and communication technologies that are transforming media culture and the economy are also reshaping how companies and employees function new social computing tools such as wikis and blogs put unprecedented communication power in the hands of employees
2633722 so to sum up when we try to look at 2010 it is in some ways more of the same but it is also more of the best just diffused and integrated

2633730 i was like no hes supposed to be low key

2634013 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2634014 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2634015 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2634016 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2634017 he had collapsed became unresponsive and with many attempts to revive him was obviously didnt happen there
2634018 he was very dedicated to the fire service not only our department but like i said he was a state instructor so he was very such a part of probably everyone in western pennsylvanias area
2634019 responsible for molecular genetics and laboratory benchwork including dna extraction pcr amplification dna cloning electrophoresis histology and fluorescent in situ hybridization
2634020 are you sure that recliner is in there good enough dont you think it should be turned the other way
2634021 if you are going to react to it be hurt by it change your ways because of it this persons advice then i hope this is someone you put on high regard as being highly competent a person who will give you godly advice and a person who respects you and doesnt reject you for you just being who you are
2634022 how great it is that she can be so carefree not to worry at all what she looks like on the outside
2634023 do you want to get up tomorrow morning and go fishing with me
2634024 if i can arrange for someone to watch panda would you like to go fishing with me
2634025 are you sure shes so little sometimes she is hidden somewhere under her covers
2634026 panda what are you doing honey are you ok come on lets go up and get in my bed together
2634027 mom sugar our hamster is out of his cage and kohl our dog is looking funny at me
2634028 mommy guess what i found sugar all by myself and juju is so proud of me because i am a big girl i just looked in the drawer and he was right there and juju didnt even see him but i did because i am a big girl
2634029 hi mom were at the playground panda is going down the slide and kohl is laying in the shade un the tree
2634030 i am going home you cannot talk to me that way
2634031 beware of poisnous snakes the boy has seen around here the last few days

2634033 welcome to chuao home of the worlds best cacao in spanish
2634034 but i feel the cacao from ocumare is superior to chuao we have better fermentation control our drying patios are enclosed so dogs or chickens cant shit on the beans in chuao dogs and chickens can walk all over the beans
2634035 youll have to make your case in front of the council
2634036 its not up to me youll have to make an appointment and meet with the board and they make the decision on who gets the beans
2634037 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for those that despitefully use you and persecute you
2634038 but i say unto you love your enemies do good to them that hate you pray for them that persecute and calumniate you
2634039 but i tell you love your enemies and pray for they that persecute you
2634040 but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you asv
2634041 and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
2634042 and his father and his mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him
2634043 the childs father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him
2634044 and his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him asv
2634045 and jesus answering him said to him it is written thou shalt adore the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
2634046 jesus answered it is written thou shalt adore the lord your god and serve him only
2634047 and jesus answered and said unto him it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
2634048 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven
2634049 the first man was of the earth earthly the second man from heaven heavenly
2634050 the first man was of the dust of the earth the second man from heaven
2634051 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is of heaven
2634052 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
2634053 and to enlighten all men that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden from eternity in god who created all things
2634054 and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery which for ages past was kept hidden in god who created all things niv
2634055 and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in god who created all things
2634056 interaction of judaism and hellenistic culture is then one of the fundamental struggles in the march of civilization and hellenistic judaism is after the bible the most remarkable contribution of the jewish genius to the worlds thought
2634057 faith is defined not simply but in a double aspect and in such a manner that its two aspects stand unconnected beside each other the assurances of what is hoped for and the conviction of things unseen
2634058 he trusts in the god with whom he is intimate this is the old testament meaning of the word to know when it is used of the relationship between god and man in addition however there is added as a second point from greek philosophy conviction only one may not then inquire who it is who effects conviction the man of faith himself which would be contrary to the sequence or as the older exegetes think the faith or as later ones do god
2634059 set out in chronological order the leading events of the history of israel and judah from the time of abraham
2634060 the first example of the propagation of the mosaic legislation in the light of greek ethical ideas
2634061 having first expounded the monotheistic principle of judaism and contrasted it with the lower ideas of god held by other peoples explains that these laws are designed to secure the purposive separateness of the jews
2634062 hellenic speculation was used to bolster hebraic belief and greek ethics to justify the jewish torah
2634063 in this case the case of judaism the language game of prescription is kept in its purity it is not taken over by ontological discourse and it is only if this game is kept pure that it can really be sophisticated
2634064 in special degree the age of criticism and to criticism everything must submit
2634065 should learn to rejoice at the worlds progress although it may not be to their own advantage or that of their country
2634066 are directed to the use of his reason are to be fully developed only in the race
2634067 an organ which is not used or an arrangement that does not attain its end is a contradiction in the teleological sense of nature for if we turn away from that fundamental principle we have then before us a nature moving without a purpose and no longer conformable to law
2634068 what with mens being close to each other and yet strangers
2634069 undoubtedly to that end the descent of all men from a single family was the best arrangement
2634070 generate a whole host of unnecessary and indeed unnatural inclinations called luxurious
2634071 conscious of his reason as a power which can extend itself beyond the limits to which animals are confined
2634072 a hint of the development of man as a moral creature here lies the true basis of sociability
2634073 must always be free and it alone can bring about enlightenment among men the private use of reason may be quite often seriously restricted
2634074 bound together with a mutual opposition which constantly threatens to break up the society
2634075 it seems more in accord with human nature and the purity of morals to base the expectation of a future world upon the sentiment of a good soul than conversely to base the souls good conduct upon the hope of another world
2634076 one of the more obvious ironies of kants intellectual development was his turn in old age to a consideration of moral implications of historical knowledge a subject to which he denied genuine philosophical interest in the mature phase of his philosophical career when under the urgings of herders thought about history and the historical events of the french revolution kant was forced to reflect on the epistemological bases the moral value and the cultural significance of historical knowledge
2634077 preemptive metaphysical prescription of human nature grounded in his conception of reason and the categorical imperative
2634078 kant is aware that men when men have risen to the apprehension of moral principles progress in moral insight is neither mechanical nor the result of purely intellectual ratiocination reason he says does not work instinctively but requires experiment practice and instruction in order to progress gradually from one level of insight to another
2634079 it is not a constitutive principle that enables us to determine anything in respect of its direct object but only a merely regulative principle and maxim to further and strengthen the empirical employment of reason
2634080 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
2634081 i confess openly i have little interest in what is generally called the final goal of socialism this goal whatever it may be is nothing to me the movement for social progress everything

2634083 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2634084 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2634085 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2634086 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2634087 what makes this complicated is that until the whole package is done its not done
2634088 yes we have things on the table that weve agreed to
2634089 they are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation
2634090 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it
2634091 the paper we knew and cared about is fast disappearing and the real losers are the people of los angeles
2634092 the roofs of the houses came off there were no windows left
2634093 i told her this needs to be done and i just left
2634094 they were the sweetest family ever they are a really christian family
2634095 they follow usa volleyball they would leave little messages for the players the whole reason they were here is because their life is usa volleyball
2634096 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2634097 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them

2634102 we like to get a good number of night practices under our belts so that when those night games roll around we are more comfortable with the surroundings
2634103 with three night games already on our schedule for this fall at fresno state vs ohio state vs penn state we will take full advantage of all the night practices we have
2634104 you guys gave us a lot today so the rest of your night is free no meetings
2634105 obviously we want to get out of last place and theyre above us
2634106 we got em for what six more so i guess weve got to go for the gusto here down the stretch and just have to keep battling like we have all year
2634107 he was throwing strikes and he didnt leave much in the middle of the plate
2634108 he wasnt easy to hit tonight he stayed down in the zone pretty much im sure he made a couple of mistakes but we didnt really jump on them
2634109 he moved the ball around on us pitched inside got ahead of the count on us youve got to give him credit
2634110 i wasnt expecting to get up again today but the way my arm feels i could go every day
2634111 go ahead ask her the worst she can say is no
2634112 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2634113 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2634114 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2634115 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2634116 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2634117 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2634118 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2634119 miller was one of the smoothest drivers ive ever seen i wanted this race so bad
2634120 i would like to think all the fans for coming out youre what keep us going keep this race great
2634121 memorial races die off pretty quick but weve been eight years on this we all love it
2634122 there was a little bit of pressure at first team owner rons hammons cars win everywhere they go
2634123 he never puts any pressure on me he just tells me to go out there and have some fun
2634124 i knew mike would be down at the bottom so i kept hammering away at the top
2634125 the car worked good these guys work pretty hard on it and they make my job look easy
2634126 i watched the sprint cars and some of those guys were running around the top there was a big cushion there to lean on so i thought id just stay up there
2634127 the race track had an awesome cushion you could just lean against it if you keep the tires from jumping it
2634128 it seems like this year its been either famine or victory weve had a heck of a lot of famines
2634129 its further evidence of the ineffectiveness of the services that lifelock advertises
2634130 theres nothing on my actual credit report about uncollected funds no outstanding tickets or warrants or anything
2634131 theres nothing to indicate my identity has been successfully compromised other than the one instance i know im taking a slightly higher risk but ill take my risk for the tremendous benefit were bringing to society and to consumers
2634132 theres been a lot of marketing a lot of hype about lifelock
2634133 the question is how much protection does it really buy you
2634134 there is no company that can guarantee they can protect you completely against identity theft
2634135 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
2634136 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
2634137 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
2634138 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
2634139 i was just hoping it would happen a lot sooner than it did
2634140 its something weve been fighting for over the last five six seven years there was a big push for it obviously among the smaller schools
2634141 it will give the smaller schools in the area a chance to showcase the talent that we have
2634142 through that time i became frustrated with the fact that minster which is a small school is playing against larger schools such as toledo st ursula academy and notre dame academy quite a number of those heavy hitting schools
2634143 when you get to that point you have to give the kids a chance thats how little schools build bigger programs and better programs is opening up that door for them
2634144 we were extremely fortunate at lcc to have such quality young ladies that come up through the lima junior golf association program
2634145 i know thats one of the things they were looking at as far as what theyre going to do when that happens
2634146 even as i hope for some measure of peace and comfort to the bereaved families
2634147 i must also hope that we as a nation draw some measure of wisdom from this tragedy
2634148 we must also engage however in the more difficult task of understanding the sources of such madness
2634149 we will have to make sure despite our rage that any u s military action takes into account the lives of innocent civilians abroad our military bent over backwards to not harm innocent bystanders although that is regrettably not always possible in war but any mistakes made by american soldiers will no doubt immediately be pounced on by liberals and the media as proof of the evil of america we will have to be unwavering in opposing bigotry or discrimination directed against neighbors and friends of middle eastern descent um it would be easier to separate the good muslims from the bad muslims if only the good muslims would publicly condemn the bad ones instead of letting them hide in their mosques finally we will have to devote far more attention to the monumental task of raising the hopes and prospects of embittered children across the globe children not just in the middle east but also in africa asia latin america eastern europe what no embittered children in western europe or australia and within our own shores

2634160 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
2634161 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
2634162 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
2634163 language is courage the ability to conceive a thought to speak it and by doing so to make it true
2634164 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
2634165 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
2634166 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
2634167 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
2634168 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients

2634170 tidak hanya itu myopia pada anak anak juga akan berpengaruh terhadap tingkat kecerdasan aktivitas sosial bahkan aspek psikologis si anak
2634171 di indonesia masih sedikit sekali data yang menggambarkan perkembangan miopia pada anak terutama anak usia sekolah dasar pada usia tersebut terjadi perubahan yang sangat signifikan terhadap perkembangan myopia
2634172 we have people who have been giving for years and years and years and people who have been coming for years
2634173 its a good way for us to spread the wealth
2634174 you have to keep this secret but its coming up 10 years if word gets out theyre gonna label us as old fogeys and well be out of business
2634175 some slightly more hip hop edged stuff which is interesting but its still from that reggae base
2634176 we spent a lot more time on song writing and just getting the songs ready before we went into the studio which was quite good so we had a clear idea of where we were going once we were in the studio
2634177 i was kind of thinking that its along the same lines of what were doing just kind of chipping away at the same block which i reckon is quite cool but then my mum said to me ooh that doesnt sound like the black seeds so there you go if mum thinks it sounds pretty different then maybe it does
2634178 wellington always seemed to be really busy theres lots going on and i was just getting too busy and stressed out i have a family as well and so i was always doing gigs during the week and then kids wake up at the crack of dawn the next morning
2634179 its been really good ive written lots of music down here and spent lots of time in the studio and probably been a bit happier as well not being so overtired and so overworked
2634180 that was quite intense having to make that call to cancel the last few shows which was the first time weve cancelled any shows but when its a life or death situation its just what has to be done
2634181 initially there were heaps of ex pats at the shows and they still come along but i think each year as the word spreads theres more of the locals from wherever which is great
2634182 its really nice to play to heaps of people that are just going this is so awesome having someone from home but its really exciting playing to overseas people as well especially if its the first time theyve heard something like that
2634183 weve been at the stage for two or three years now where this is our job we dont have to do anything else which is awesome and were pretty lucky to be in that position
2634184 were so lucky to be able to live in such a great country and be full time musicians i feel very privileged thank you helen clark for the artists benefit that got me by when i didnt make enough money and then i got to ditch it when i did make enough money
2634185 not necessarily massively better than national but theyre definitely better
2634186 new zealand music is awesome and fans should support it generally theres lots of people that arent as lucky as me whose music i like that dont get to do it as a full time job and it would be great to see some of those artists be able to do that
2634187 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children

2634190 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
2634191 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
2634192 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
2634193 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
2634194 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
2634195 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
2634196 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
2634197 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
2634198 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
2634199 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
2634200 internationally recognized as the preeminent magazine for calligraphers and lettering artists

2634203 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2634204 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2634205 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2634206 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2634207 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2634208 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
2634209 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
2634210 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
2634211 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
2634212 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
2634213 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
2634214 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
2634215 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
2634216 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
2634217 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell

2634224 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
2634225 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
2634226 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
2634227 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
2634228 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
2634229 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
2634230 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
2634231 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
2634232 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
2634233 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
2634234 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
2634235 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
2634236 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
2634237 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
2634238 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
2634239 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
2634240 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
2634241 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
2634242 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
2634243 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
2634244 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
2634245 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
2634246 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
2634247 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
2634248 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
2634249 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
2634250 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
2634251 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
2634252 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
2634253 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
2634254 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
2634255 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
2634256 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
2634257 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
2634258 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
2634259 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
2634260 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
2634261 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
2634262 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
2634263 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
2634264 dahulu ada dua orang saudara pada masa rasulullah salah seorang daripadanya mendatangi nabi dan saudaranya yang lain bekerja lalu saudaranya yang bekerja itu mengadu kepada nabi maka beliau bersabda mudah mudahan engkau diberi rizki dengan sebab dia
2634265 makna mudah mudahan dalam sabda beliau mudah mudahan engkau bisa kembali kepada rasulullah sehingga ber fungsi untuk memberikan kepastian bahwa dia mendapat kan rizki karena berkah saudaranya dan menegur bahwa dia mendapatkan rizki bukan karena pekerjaannya
2634266 bukanlah kalian diberi rizki karena sebab orang orang lemah di antara kalian
2634267 berinfaklah kepada orang orang fakir yang terikat oleh jihad di jalan allah mereka tidak dapat beru saha di muka bumi orang yang tidak tahu menyangka mereka orang kaya karena memelihara diri dari me minta minta kamu kenal mereka dengan melihat sifat sifatnya mereka tidak meminta kepada orang secara mendesak dan apa saja harta yang baik yang kamu nafkahkan di jalan allah maka sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui
2634268 sesungguhnya aku tidak mengetahui suatu kedudukan setelah kenabian yang lebih utama daripada kedudukan para ulama jika hati para ulama itu sibuk mencari kebutuhan hidupnya niscaya ia tidak bisa memberi perhatian sepe nuhnya kepada ilmu serta tidak akan bisa belajar dengan baik karena itu membuat mereka bisa mempelajari ilmu secara sepenuhnya adalah lebih utama
2634269 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu saling memakan harta sesamamu dengan jalan yang batil kecuali dengan jalan perniagaan yang berlaku dengan suka sama suka di antara kamu dan janganlah kamu membunuh dirimu
2634270 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
2634271 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
2634272 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure

2634281 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
2634282 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
2634283 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
2634284 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
2634285 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
2634286 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
2634287 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
2634288 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
2634289 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
2634290 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
2634291 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
2634292 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
2634293 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
2634294 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
2634295 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
2634296 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
2634297 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
2634298 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
2634299 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
2634300 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
2634301 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
2634302 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
2634303 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
2634304 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
2634305 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
2634306 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
2634307 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
2634308 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
2634309 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
2634310 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
2634311 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
2634312 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
2634313 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
2634314 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
2634315 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
2634316 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
2634317 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
2634318 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
2634319 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
2634320 i told bob bowman that this would be my last 400 im
2634321 ive got to go out there and get a good time and this was a good time afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2634322 i guess you can say i went out too fast
2634323 the backstroke took a lot out of me but i did my best i cant ask for anything more
2634324 i stayed a lot smoother and rode my stroke a lot more it definitely felt good
2634325 making it into the final was the only thing i was after
2634326 i went faster than last night and thats always a good sign
2634327 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2634328 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
2634329 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
2634330 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
2634331 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
2634332 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
2634333 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
2634334 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
2634335 we will certainly impressing on our athletes that when their competition is over and they go downtown there are so many volunteers around that it would be wise to be branded
2634336 we really should be insisting they wear their team gear
2634337 i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for your security if you are in gear
2634338 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
2634339 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
2634340 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
2634341 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
2634342 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2634343 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2634344 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2634345 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2634346 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
2634347 our study sheds new light on how that process works
2634348 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
2634349 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
2634350 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
2634351 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
2634352 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
2634353 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
2634354 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
2634355 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
2634356 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
2634357 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
2634358 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
2634359 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
2634360 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
2634361 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
2634362 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
2634363 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
2634364 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
2634365 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
2634366 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
2634367 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
2634368 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
2634369 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
2634370 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
2634371 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
2634372 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
2634373 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
2634374 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
2634375 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
2634376 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
2634377 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
2634378 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
2634379 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
2634380 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
2634381 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
2634382 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
2634383 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
2634384 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
2634385 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice

2634390 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
2634391 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
2634392 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
2634393 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
2634394 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
2634395 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
2634396 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
2634397 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
2634398 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
2634399 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
2634400 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
2634401 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
2634402 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
2634403 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
2634404 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
2634405 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
2634406 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
2634407 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
2634408 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
2634409 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
2634410 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
2634411 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
2634412 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
2634413 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
2634414 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
2634415 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
2634416 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
2634417 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
2634418 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
2634419 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
2634420 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
2634421 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
2634422 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
2634423 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
2634424 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
2634425 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
2634426 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
2634427 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
2634428 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
2634429 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2634430 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
2634431 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
2634432 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
2634433 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
2634434 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
2634435 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
2634436 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
2634437 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
2634438 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
2634439 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
2634440 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
2634441 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
2634442 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
2634443 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
2634444 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
2634445 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
2634446 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
2634447 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2634448 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
2634449 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
2634450 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
2634451 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
2634452 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
2634453 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
2634454 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited

2634460 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
2634461 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
2634462 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
2634463 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
2634464 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
2634465 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
2634466 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
2634467 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme

2634474 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
2634475 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
2634476 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
2634477 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
2634478 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
2634479 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
2634480 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
2634481 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
2634482 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
2634483 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
2634484 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
2634485 we will do whatever we can to save these children
2634486 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
2634487 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
2634488 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
2634489 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
2634490 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
2634491 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
2634492 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy

2634497 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
2634498 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
2634499 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
2634500 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
2634501 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
2634502 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
2634503 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
2634504 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
2634505 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
2634506 starting this fall t mobile usa will take the extraordinary step of ditching its traditional deck on the phone and replacing it with a platform thats open to almost any developer multiple sources have told us
2634507 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
2634508 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
2634509 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
2634510 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
2634511 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
2634512 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2634513 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes
2634514 im going to vote for evo because hes always going to support us
2634515 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2634516 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2634517 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2634518 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2634519 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2634520 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2634521 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2634522 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2634523 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2634524 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2634525 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2634526 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2634527 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2634528 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2634529 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2634530 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2634531 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2634532 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2634533 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2634534 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2634535 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2634536 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2634537 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2634538 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2634539 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2634540 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2634541 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2634542 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2634543 theyll probably see the highlights and i think theyll understand hes a great kid and hes had a great camp so far he can make plays hes got speed hes a great football player
2634544 he knows how to get in and out of his routes and obviously he knows how to catch the ball chris johnson has another level of speed and hes going to help us
2634545 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2634546 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2634547 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2634548 re re painting dss room and need input access is forbidden deep echoing voice forbiddennnnnnnnn rahhhhhhh i
2634549 re re re painting dss room and need input access where was forbidden the projector or my website kristi myspace
2634550 re re re re re painting dss room and need input girl you gettin your drink on lol just kidding youre funny
2634551 re re re re painting dss room and need input the projectorororororor lol sorry when i saw it i just got this vision of some monty
2634552 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2634553 miles davis and the modern jazz giants avec deux superbes morceaux round midnight et the man i love
2634554 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2634555 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2634556 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2634557 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2634558 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2634559 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2634560 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2634561 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2634562 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2634563 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2634564 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2634565 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2634566 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2634567 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2634568 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2634569 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2634570 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2634571 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2634572 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2634573 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2634574 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2634575 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2634576 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2634577 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2634578 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2634579 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2634580 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2634581 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2634582 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2634583 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2634584 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2634585 nosotros somos doce estrellas pero un equipo hay que saber conjuntar los talentos para poder llevarse el oro en ese aspecto el ejemplo es espa a
2634586 tienen muchos jugadores de gran calidad los gasol navarro calder n rudy sabemos que es uno de los equipos que nos separan del oro
2634587 es uno de los rivales en el camino hacia las medallas son muy buenos en el uno contra uno y en la concepci n de equipo
2634588 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2634589 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2634590 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2634591 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2634592 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2634593 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2634594 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2634595 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2634596 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2634597 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2634598 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2634599 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2634600 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2634601 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2634602 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2634603 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2634604 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2634605 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2634606 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2634607 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2634608 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2634609 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2634610 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2634611 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2634612 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2634613 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2634614 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2634615 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2634616 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2634617 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2634618 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2634619 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2634620 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2634621 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2634622 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2634623 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2634624 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2634625 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2634626 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2634627 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2634628 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2634629 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2634630 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2634631 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2634632 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2634633 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2634634 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2634635 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2634636 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2634637 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2634638 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2634639 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2634640 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2634641 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2634642 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2634643 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2634644 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2634645 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2634646 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2634647 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2634648 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2634649 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2634650 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2634651 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2634652 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2634653 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2634654 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2634655 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2634656 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2634657 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2634658 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2634659 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2634660 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2634661 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2634662 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2634663 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2634664 rauque de vieille porte rouill e malang avec la voix dun mec
2634665 yaya nyanya meet need your angry germans yaya nyanya meet your angry germans spank me spank me hahahaha take a little piece of my tchechoslovakia
2634666 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2634667 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2634668 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2634669 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2634670 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2634671 just so you all know we did set a record
2634672 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2634673 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2634674 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2634675 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2634676 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2634677 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2634678 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2634679 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2634680 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2634681 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2634682 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2634683 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2634684 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2634685 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2634686 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2634687 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2634688 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2634689 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2634690 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2634691 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2634692 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2634693 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2634694 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2634695 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2634696 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2634697 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2634698 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2634699 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2634700 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2634701 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2634702 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2634703 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2634704 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2634705 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2634706 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2634707 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2634708 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2634709 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2634710 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2634711 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2634712 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2634713 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2634714 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2634715 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2634716 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2634717 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2634718 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2634719 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2634720 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2634721 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2634722 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2634723 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2634724 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2634725 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2634726 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2634727 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2634728 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2634729 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2634730 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2634731 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2634732 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2634733 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2634734 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2634735 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2634736 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2634737 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2634738 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2634739 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2634740 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2634741 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2634742 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2634743 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2634744 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2634745 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2634746 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2634747 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2634748 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2634749 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2634750 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2634751 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2634752 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2634753 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2634754 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2634755 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2634756 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2634757 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2634758 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2634759 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2634760 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2634761 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2634762 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2634763 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2634764 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2634765 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2634766 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2634767 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2634768 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2634769 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2634770 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2634771 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2634772 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2634773 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2634774 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2634775 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2634776 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2634777 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2634778 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2634779 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2634780 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2634781 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2634782 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2634783 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2634784 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2634785 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2634786 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2634787 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2634788 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2634789 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2634790 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2634791 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2634792 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2634793 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2634794 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2634795 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2634796 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2634797 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2634798 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2634799 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2634800 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2634801 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2634802 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2634803 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2634804 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2634805 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2634806 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2634807 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2634808 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2634809 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2634810 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2634811 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2634812 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2634813 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2634814 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2634815 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2634816 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2634817 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2634818 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2634819 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2634820 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2634821 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2634822 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2634823 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2634824 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2634825 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2634826 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2634827 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2634828 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2634829 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2634830 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2634831 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2634832 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2634833 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2634834 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2634835 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2634836 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2634837 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2634838 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2634839 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2634840 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2634841 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2634842 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2634843 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2634844 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2634845 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2634846 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2634847 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2634848 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2634849 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2634850 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2634851 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2634852 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2634853 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2634854 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2634855 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2634856 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2634857 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2634858 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2634859 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2634860 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2634861 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2634862 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2634863 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2634864 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2634865 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2634866 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2634867 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2634868 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2634869 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2634870 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2634871 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2634872 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2634873 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2634874 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2634875 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2634876 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2634877 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2634878 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2634879 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2634880 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2634881 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2634882 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2634883 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2634884 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2634885 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2634886 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2634887 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2634888 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2634889 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2634890 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2634891 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2634892 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2634893 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2634894 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2634895 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2634896 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2634897 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2634898 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2634899 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2634900 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2634901 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2634902 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2634903 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2634904 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2634905 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2634906 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2634907 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2634908 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2634909 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2634910 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2634911 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2634912 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2634913 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2634914 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2634915 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2634916 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2634917 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2634918 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2634919 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2634920 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2634921 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2634922 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2634923 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2634924 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2634925 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2634926 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2634927 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2634928 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2634929 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2634930 it is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top arctic predator displaced by climate
2634931 we saw the polar bear on our first clear day after several days of poor weather
2634932 the bear didnt come near us but the prospect of maintaining a round the clock vigil while trying to do our surveys had us concerned
2634933 and there will be three different sub divisions because there are so many gymnasts to get through and all of the men will be working their way around six pieces of apparatus
2634934 baikal is the greatest lake in the world it is a limitless reserve and source for water that all of humanity can drink without any sort of purification
2634935 this is a priceless gift for everyone whether you live in bolshiye koty or florida or kansas
2634936 we say that only romantics do this sort of work
2634937 theres a kind of work that just has to be done whether you like it or not and its just worked out that were the ones who have to do it
2634938 is an indicator of whether modern man can curb his appetite and preserve what nature has created
2634939 before the year is over this ground will hold the nations first solar highway project and oregon will make history using the power of the sun to light this interchange
2634940 more importantly this project will represent a new era for energy in oregon
2634941 it will represent a step forward toward our vision of an energy independent oregon and it will represent the endless opportunities before us to chart this course of clean reliable and renewable energy for our state
2634942 pge is committed to developing and promoting more solar power in oregon
2634943 we appreciate the innovative approach the governor and odot are taking to support our solar industry and make oregon first in solar highways
2634944 this could be a perfect way to take something we own the right of way and realize multiple value out of it
2634945 its also a great way to help us reduce our carbon footprint
2634946 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2634947 four people who entered the site are now in police custody and police are dealing with a number of other people who are trying to get in

2634985 ive done all i can do i just dont know what to say any longer
2634986 i truly do not believe it is a matter of what you have or have not said people who make this decision do it for many many reasons and only rarely do they do so for strictly theological ones i am sure if we could dig a little deeper we would find many personal reasons that have nothing to do with formal theological issues
2634987 of course i know but it is so tremendously difficult to see someone simply abandon the gospel and walk into the arms of heresy you want to do something
2634988 but i learned a long time ago that you cannot force someone to hear you you cannot force someone to think rationally to obey truth or to recognize error if they have chosen not to do so it is beyond your capacity nor can you judge your ministry of the word on the basis of such an action by someone in your congregation the apostles faced this same situation so surely it was not a matter of failure for them nor for you
2634989 but it really doesnt make me feel any better right now
2634990 i know so your suggestion that she talk to me was ignored let me guess im too lets see harsh unloving
2634991 seems the double standard doesnt bother her her new found mentors can write or say anything but if anyone responds to their arguments and in fact refutes them well they are unloving and unkind and unchristian you name the excuse
2634992 i know i cant believe we have to discipline someone who grew up in our midst
2634993 she has embraced deadly heresy roger gods people must be warned and we can only hope the seriousness of the response will communicate to her the gravity of what she has done besides i think you will want to spend some time going over the foundations of the faith from the pulpit once again just to make sure everyone is clear on the basics
2634994 i have always sought to be faithful in preaching the whole counsel of god she heard it preached over and over again i thought she loved the truth
2634995 elders are not given a supernatural ability to see into the hearts of their congregations nor are you expected to you exhort you warn you encourage you teach and you trust in christs promise to build his church but in his way in his time you hope the best especially for those who are under your ministry for years but you know that longevity is not a sure sign of calling and of course we dont know how long this fascination with rome will last sacramentalism cannot long satisfy the heart of the truly redeemed and if she is well the honeymoon cant last forever
2634996 yes of course well thank you for coming i will keep you appraised of any developments in the situation
2634997 barbara has a sort of custody of that disabled son since he is living with her though he was 18 and since the son is on blakes health insurance by court order there is no way you can truly escape barbara you will have to speak with her on insurance matters or else pay someone else to do this

2635116 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2635117 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2635118 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2635119 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2635120 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2635121 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2635122 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2635123 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2635124 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2635125 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2635126 may have been viewed as a green light for aggression in the region

2635130 i was disappointed in my experience maybe people in my family hyping it up led to nothing but disappointment i found the meat to be very good however as a person who lives to try steak houses in new cities i would rate jeff rubys and berns far ahead of lugers i did not appreciate my waiter rushing me to order arguing with me about which type of potatoes i had chosen and not explaining the different cuts of meat better i had a table full of kids with there parents allowing them to run around which at these prices i did not expect i appreciate tradition but the tables were bland chairs uncomfortable and service rude why am i rating 4 stars the food was simply that good i do not recommend taking the subway at night dress how you want as well no need for even a collar pass on the strudel if you dont love raisins pecan pie was much better

2635134 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being

2635161 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2635162 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly

2635291 langkah pertama ialah kita harus mengerti apa yang dimaksud dengan
2635292 hoy me enter a trav s de los distintos medios de informaci n que la ltima conferencia de prensa a agenda abierta de un presidente creo que sic fue en 1999 y en este mismo lugar quiere decir que todo aquello que hab amos o do que solamente durante la anterior gesti n no hab a habido conferencias de prensa se debe tambi n a un error de informaci n parece ser sic que no solamente el anterior ex presidente n stor kirchner no dio conferencias de prensa sino tampoco lo hicieron otros ex presidentes
2635293 as que la primera aclaraci n viene para poner las cosas blanco sobre negro negro sobre blanco como les gusta decir a ustedes y creo que desde 1999 y precisamente en este lugar era que no se hac a una conferencia de prensa a agenda abierta
2635294 no podemos perder ni un minuto buscando consensos este no es el gobierno del consenso sino el de resolver problemas

2635301 a m que estoy en la cola de los que deben pagar insumos y quincenas que este se or no me venga a decir c mo est n las cosas y hoy las cosas no est n bien
2635302 el poder de moreno est intacto moreno es kirchner y es por eso que quien reemplaza a sbatella es un hombre de santa cruz
2635303 est donde deben estar los ministros de econom a de los kirchner o sea hablando poco y comport ndose como un secretario de hacienda
2635304 con cobos est todo mal la concertaci n ahora pasa por otra gente la asistencia de cleto a la exposici n rural fue una provocaci n que molest mucho en los kirchner y sus alrededores est la idea de limitarlo al m ximo posible si pudieran le sacar an hasta la silla

2635509 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2635510 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2635511 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2635514 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2635515 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2635516 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2635546 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2635547 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2635548 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2635549 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa

2635553 ultrapassam o limite da compreens o das ac es militares

2635556 then i started to cry as we knelt on the kitchen floor i said mommy imma love you till you dont hurt no more and when im older you aint gotta work no more and imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
2635557 it was a green metal box with a few paint marks on it with quite a few wires coming out of it into my daughter it didnt look like a normal nhs one
2635558 but it was the only hope for her even when she got hooked up to the dialysis machine they said that every hour was a bonus
2635559 shes fine now a normal two year old i just cant thank him enough for saving my babys life
2635560 this machine is only being used on the tiniest earliest babies where there is nothing else that can be done
2635561 miller was one of the smoothest drivers ive ever seen i wanted this race so bad
2635562 i would like to think all the fans for coming out youre what keep us going keep this race great
2635563 memorial races die off pretty quick but weve been eight years on this we all love it
2635564 there was a little bit of pressure at first team owner rons hammons cars win everywhere they go
2635565 he never puts any pressure on me he just tells me to go out there and have some fun
2635566 i knew mike would be down at the bottom so i kept hammering away at the top
2635567 the car worked good these guys work pretty hard on it and they make my job look easy
2635568 i watched the sprint cars and some of those guys were running around the top there was a big cushion there to lean on so i thought id just stay up there
2635569 the race track had an awesome cushion you could just lean against it if you keep the tires from jumping it
2635570 it seems like this year its been either famine or victory weve had a heck of a lot of famines

2635620 this is our 5th year of collections and we just completed our 5th boutique this our 2nd event of the year last month we were at colonie center nest month well be at clifton park center and the following month will be at price chopper in mohawk commons
2635621 even if people create greater supplies of environmentally preferable fish and even if there is more demand for it from consumers the seafood supply chain doesnt always cooperate
2635622 well have the resources to support an all out effort at product placement
2635623 seafood is a large industry but its very fragmented informal and artisanal so people have been hesitant from a business standpoint how do you build a business around that
2635624 sea change has begun to change the opinion investors have of fisheries as a place to look for investment
2635625 thats really important because the transition to sustainable methods requires capital
2635626 our goal is to create a market response to the global seafood crisis by building a network of artisanal seafood producers both in the wild sector and aquaculture
2635627 we want to take them to new markets they could not reach on their own and build a branded presence
2635628 i want people to think about the producer to consumer connection
2635629 so cleanfish decided to step back and say cleanfish presents loch duart salmon
2635630 right now there is no sustainably produced farmed salmon anywhere in the world
2635631 cleanfish tries to label people as green who are doing something a little better than the bad guys but its still not sustainable
2635632 if sustainable seafood is to grow youve got to be talking about aquaculture because fisheries are not going to be expanding in the wild
2635633 and if we want positive change in aquaculture we need to recognize and reward the better practitioners
2635634 some choices they make arent on our seafood watch card but i dont want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good
2635635 cleanfish is building an important brand the more visible brands like cleanfish that there are the better off we all will be
2635636 most challenging year to date with regard to efforts at the state level to restrict directory publishers ability to freely deliver phone books

2635640 the profits will now be hurt by the constant expense
2635641 we will get to see in all of its splendor what the banking and legal fees are
2635642 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement
2635643 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy
2635644 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
2635645 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
2635646 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
2635647 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
2635648 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up
2635649 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results
2635650 its an icon of 20th century aviation and it was a piece of the puzzle
2635651 we had to respect it we didnt want the new terminal to have a looming presence
2635652 ninety nine percent of the time breach letters look like a piece of junk mail and people throw them away
2635653 that is no guarantee that that information is not out there and available to people to use for fraudulent purchases
2635654 our recommendation to consumers is that they never use debit or check cards
2635655 once that information has been compromised it provides criminals with a direct pipeline into their banking
2635656 if for some reason you dont get your statement on time that would be a red flag that something might not be right
2635657 did you know that one of our mutual funds just changed managers
2635658 ive only had an open track in front of me two times and ive won both of those times
2635659 its just a matter of finding the time to run people down and then having enough to win it
2635660 weve gone to a harder compound this year and its made it harder to pass the preferred lane in our division is the lower lane but if a guy gets there youve got to be almost a half second faster to make the pass on the outside

2635667 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2635668 i cant understand their logic why are they bombing civilians
2635669 i cant tell you too much but were getting close to making an announcement
2635670 i really cant confirm or deny that theres anything in this office until a finding of probable cause
2635671 please know that a copy of your message has been forwarded to the fraud office of the attorney general of our state do stay in touch wed love to welcome you for a rather long visit
2635672 this driving program is a wonderful thing and i wish they would do more of this even for drivers education classes
2635673 drivers education just teaches you how to pass the driving test not how to drive in real world conditions like this
2635674 look where you want to go not where you are heading
2635675 that is by far one of the hardest things for people to do if you want to go through the cones point the car there thats where it will go
2635676 i learned a lot it makes perfect sense now i have a lot better chance of not freaking out if something like that ever happened
2635677 this whole thing offers experience that as a parent i would never otherwise be able to provide
2635678 im petrified about them driving but what im seeing here today is amazing and i wish every kid their age could get this experience
2635679 i could be sitting in a room and it was so obvious i was a civilian
2635680 i was the center of attention even when i didnt want to be
2635681 naoto has had sex with all four sisters not in the name of love but on a mission to impregnate one of them and prevent being disowned by his family however as the ceremony draws near he realizes that what he has been doing is foolish and must correct his actions before he loses his new true love forever
2635682 its time for dessert with a sweet helping of g taste first we get a glimpse into the life of sayaka a beautiful teacher whose luscious body aches for satisfaction shes just not getting enough and poor sayaka doesnt even know whats wrong until doctor fubuki steps in to give her a woman to woman examination then we have misuzu a kind quiet girl who just happens to look ravishing in a swimsuit when shes around a certain guy she likes she just cant control herself shell bare all and do anything but she still cant get her man its up to sayaka to step in and show her how to put her natural assets to good use
2635683 the lanes do not align real well so folks in the middle lane would be headed toward the folks across the street in the oncoming left turn lane
2635684 residents are certainly welcome to suggest capital improvement projects that they feel are needed
2635685 we have individuals showing up saying i dont want to stop
2635686 were looking at how to rally these volunteers for the good of mankind
2635687 theres still a lot of work to be done in these schools
2635688 i think more of these would be great for the community property values would rise there might be less crime in some areas
2635689 not every day because im 80 and i have dance twice a week
2635690 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
2635691 it was a great day we wanted to make sure we got out here on the last day
2635692 it was a lot of fun but we are sad to see it go
2635693 it was nice to have it in such a local location
2635694 i am really excited because i know what is to come
2635695 i dont like they are moving so far away from us
2635696 he could come off gruff and strict and if you asked a question you were going to get a straight answer but he was such a jokester
2635697 he was concerned for the employees they had families mortgages
2635698 one time he went to look for prom dresses with our older daughter
2635699 she fell in love with one but it was expensive
2635700 they came home without the dress but later hildebrant went out by himself and bought it
2635701 hed dominate the conversation if you didnt watch him politics religion science he wasnt neutral on anything
2635702 for years don would joke and say when i die i just want you to stand me up in a corner and have a good time
2635703 well talk about all the funny things he did all the good things he did
2635704 hes trying to defend the indefensible when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars
2635705 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone

2635709 i am very happy about our performance today against a very technical talented japan team
2635710 besides a great goal by carli lloyd i am very happy about our tactics
2635711 we are trying to get to the top of the conference and to get three points in this game was important
2635712 this is a huge three points for us because it puts us above columbus and right up there behind new england
2635713 we ended up taking advantage of that situation where we had the 11 on 10 our guys moved the ball pretty well we had a little bit of luck on the first goal but sometimes you need that
2635714 he understands what it takes to play in this league and how to play he knew he was at fault for that first goal and he found himself in a spot where he was just alert enough to get in on the end of that play it was a great ball that marco pappa played across tomasz frankowski took a good shot and reis made a good save but wilman was there to tap it in
2635715 i think that we put a game together for 90 minutes which weve struggled to do this season
2635716 tonight we did the job for the full 90 minutes we were blocking shots getting in front of balls and showing a lot of character defensively its something we needed to do and now we use this as motivation to try and continue playing like we did today
2635717 weve got two guys in the olympics two guys suspended three back home injured and we picked up another couple of injuries today
2635718 so we were down to the bare bones and the young guys have come in there stepped up and done a great job
2635719 im extremely disappointed and embarrassed today with our performance im not going to point fingers at anybody but the players need to perform im in charge and of course i am responsible and i will take the blame for it i expected people to step up and they didnt do it
2635720 we will certainly impressing on our athletes that when their competition is over and they go downtown there are so many volunteers around that it would be wise to be branded
2635721 we really should be insisting they wear their team gear
2635722 i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for your security if you are in gear
2635723 amiga entiendo que est s confundida el poema te lo escrib m s para tratar de ayudarte a aclarar tu mente
2635724 it felt good out there it was our first time on centre but its so humid it was kind of hard to get your breath back in long rallies
2635725 those managed entities that are capable of returning performance statistics are performance providers
2635726 this is one awesome mattress have i ever told you how much i love the mattresses in good hotels im a complete slut for them
2635727 thats all it would have taken to get you into bed before this a pricey room with a pillow top mattress
2635728 ow no really suk do you know how long ive wanted to lay next to you like this
2635729 listen its been since the first day you walked into the restaurant for your interview
2635730 i know its been a long time a veritable eternity let me tell you
2635731 youve got to admit this feels pretty good doesnt it
2635732 it feels sort of natural and i think is the first time all day ive relaxed plus this mattress is awfully comfortable
2635733 im too old for sleep overs i dont want to play games i want you for real youve got my complete attention
2635734 how come you never said anything about this before now
2635735 i dont know it never seemed like the right time you were dating and then i was dating meg by the time meg and i split you were with what was her name stone
2635736 yeah and work kept getting in the way for a while i was even your boss
2635737 youre so amazingly soft and warm you dont even feel real you feel better than i ever imagined
2635738 i was just thinking we could use some more pillows
2635739 snippets of erotica sometimes seem to do more for me than a whole story i guess its like seeing a flash of leg or a single button undone instead of full nudity at any rate i loved this site lesbian themed erotic haiku newish just started in september but with a delicious collection of sexy snippets
2635740 it really hasnt sunk in i was under the impression bernie was improving and was going to pull through this
2635741 its a terrible loss bernie was such a bigger than life personality even on the set of the oceans pictures filled with nothing but big stars he was a huge presence that says something

2635744 more cautious figure than warren might have passed on the opportunity to become a political lightning rod
2635745 i dont see them doing it with an episcopal bishop or a cardinal or another evangelical
2635746 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
2635747 it can be such a disappointment when you feel god leading you to start a group and then only one person shows up but from personal experience i can say that god knows what he is doing and may have planned it that way the first time i had only one woman come to a hopekeepers meeting we ended up having an amazing conversation later she disclosed that she was extremely leery about attending and probably wouldnt have spoken at all if other people had been there
2635748 jane i know some of us can identify with what you are sharing can someone else tell us how she or he has dealt with the emotions that accompany a situation that was similar
2635749 since we want to have plenty of time at the end to share something uplifting lets move on to question five jane would it be okay if people could offer their encouragement after the meeting or maybe later this week with a phone call or email
2635750 every single week andy went over to see sawyer to do something with him
2635751 hed take him out to the movies crutches and all
2635752 he wanted to show that life is fleeting and that the only thing that can really satisfy us is eternity and christs love
2635753 he was a friend of guys who liked to party a friend of spiritual people a friend of kids a friend of senior adults
2635754 everyone would say i want a piece of what this guy has
2635755 he wasnt the prototypical homecoming king blown back sandy blonde hair and 14 inch biceps
2635756 people loved him for the size of his heart not his external qualities
2635757 andy set the standard for us in character leadership self control and self sacrifice
2635758 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2635759 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2635760 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2635761 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call
2635762 healthy people are the greatest asset of any nation and molecular screening promises better management of health risk
2635763 this will lead to specific interventions aimed at reducing risks including adjustments for nutrition lifestyle and environment
2635764 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
2635765 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump yeah 10 years from now 2 cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
2635766 to address the unique needs of immigrant and refugee women struggling to become self sufficient contributing members of society
2635767 anyone truly qualified for a political office doesnt want it

2635774 i know about all the media hoopla and everything else thats brought around it
2635775 loiterers on the porch of knockemstiffs general store adjourned to the inside when they saw a stranger with a camera
2635776 they probably had said stuff they didnt want to be saying
2635777 knockemstiff had a reputation for being a really rough place
2635778 when i started writing i took that and cranked it up a few amps
2635779 maintenance standards have deteriorated at united as operational decisions are increasingly driven by economic considerations

2635781 look at all these people united would be making money is oil were 200 00 a barrel

2635907 we cant point our finger at anyone even though id like to
2635908 but why was she there why was she left there
2635909 what threw us was when we found out where she was actually found
2635910 i think thats the hardest part and thats why we cant really rest until we actually know what happened
2635911 a lot of us think that her drink might have been spiked
2635912 she was already on medicationand i know she wasnt well on the thursday
2635913 im just holding on hoping it will turn out to be natural causes
2635914 if we find out it was an epileptic fit and it was just one of those things that went wrong well id rather that than find out in six or 12 months time that her drink had been spiked
2635915 when i found out i didnt want to believe it was her it still feels like oh shell call me its so unfair
2635916 you just think of all the evil out there and all the wrongdoers and they take someone as beautiful and innocent as nelly who didnt have the chance to have children or grow up
2635917 she spoke to me several hours beforehand and said mum i really dont want to go
2635918 she was rushing back home to get ready and she had other plans romantic plans and she really didnt feel like going but i guess she felt obliged
2635919 i just hold on to that maybe if she had stuck to her gut and just stayed at home maybe she would still be here

2635946 i performed for the queen and prince philip at her jubilee
2635947 i met them after i performed and the queen was polite and everything you would imagine she seemed to remember me from stage and shook my hand but prince phillip wasnt so impressed he said to me what is it you do
2635948 its my favourite hobby and perhaps one that people who dont know me wouldnt expect me to be into
2635949 i learned at ski rossendale and now i go to the alps as often as i can

2635986 history should teach the next generation and the next generation that something should not be done again or not be repeated again and that our next generation not be treated as perpetual immigrants but as equal partners in this land
2635987 there is an urgent need to protect and preserve the historical sites with their artifacts and skeletal remains
2635988 since much historical info and artifacts are in private homes much will disappear with the passing away of our older generation
2635989 this lack of a sincere commemoration of chinese pioneer history has resulted in chinese canadians being treated as perpetual immigrants thus hurting the self image of many particularly our next generations

2636023 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
2636024 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
2636025 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed

2636029 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2636030 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2636031 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2636032 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2636033 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2636034 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
2636035 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
2636036 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
2636037 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
2636038 clade c vaccine products certainly warrant further investigation in light of several recent publications regarding potentially novel properties of the c envelope and because more than half of the global hiv 1 infections are clade c
2636039 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
2636040 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2636041 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2636042 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella
2636043 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
2636044 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers
2636045 these polymers are flexible and can be used for heating and cooling so there may be many different possible applications
2636046 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
2636047 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2636048 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2636049 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2636050 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2636051 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2636052 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
2636053 with exposure to an environment that has poor quality air pollutants may trigger symptoms of asthma in a dose dependent manner
2636054 with the high minute ventilation amount of air breathed in one minute seen during exercise the effects of exposure to these pollutants are more noticeable in athletes than in non athletes and likely more evident in people with asthma than in those without asthma
2636055 however a significant percentage of the pollution about 35 at the olympic stadium can be attributed to sources outside beijing controlling only local sources of pollution may not be sufficient to achieve the air quality goal set for the beijing games
2636056 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2636057 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2636058 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
2636059 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
2636060 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2636061 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
2636062 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
2636063 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
2636064 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2636065 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2636066 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
2636067 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
2636068 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
2636069 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered

2636076 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon
2636077 mr bachman and his wife barbara were visiting the drum tower in beijing china when they were attacked shortly after noon by an assailant wielding a knife
2636078 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2636079 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening

2636083 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2636084 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2636085 according to some reports several russian ships are patrolling near the port of poti and are blocking ships from entering the port with grain and fuel supplies necessary for georgia
2636086 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2636087 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2636088 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2636089 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2636090 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2636091 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2636092 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2636093 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2636094 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2636095 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2636096 i am pretty happy about that that was a pretty emotional race today

2636165 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2636166 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2636167 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2636168 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2636169 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2636170 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2636171 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2636172 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2636173 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2636174 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2636175 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2636176 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2636177 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2636178 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2636179 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2636180 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2636181 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2636182 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2636183 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2636184 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2636185 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2636186 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2636187 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2636188 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2636189 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2636190 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2636191 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2636192 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2636193 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2636194 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2636195 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2636196 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2636197 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2636198 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2636199 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2636200 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2636206 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2636207 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2636208 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2636209 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2636210 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2636211 the very concept of sin comes from the bible christianity offers to solve a problem of its own making would you be thankful to a person who cut you with a knife in order to sell you a bandage
2636212 if anyone is lacking in wisdom let him keep on asking god for he gives genrousl to all and without reproaching and it will be given him
2636213 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2636214 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2636215 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2636216 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2636217 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2636218 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2636224 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2636225 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2636226 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2636227 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2636228 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2636229 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2636230 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2636231 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2636232 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2636233 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2636234 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2636235 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2636236 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2636237 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2636238 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2636239 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2636240 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2636241 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2636242 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2636243 yeah its from a book can i go back to work now

2636268 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2636269 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2636270 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow

2636290 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry in the russian arsenal they have launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2636291 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2636292 if the russian side is simply convinced it wants to keep pressing the attack militarily there is not much the georgians can do theyre being hit very hard so we have to rely on diplomacy

2636313 i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities
2636314 we cannot abuse the concept of national sovereignty to deny the rest of the continent the right and duty to intervene when behind those sovereign boundaries people are being slaughtered to protect tyranny
2636315 the history of soweto is the history of south africa as prominent anc leader walter sislu wrote it is a microcosm
2636316 we talk about a lost continent which blinds us to seeing elements of progress and hope neither the united states nor the european union have a clear africa strategy we have all lost africa from our mind set and political agenda but we should start now to re discover africa as a vital strategic and economic region in world affairs why africa matters
2636317 george orwell to understand this sad story of suppressed pigs becoming suppressing farmers themselves

2636326 to save the river we need water and we need it now
2636327 i just want to celebrate life by saying to hell with death what better way of saying that than by taking the ultimate symbol of death and covering it in the ultimate symbol of luxury desire and decadence
2636328 we preserve buildings because theyre historic for their historic value because they are architectural works of art
2636329 but why not take a picture why not document the place then tear it down and make room for something new and modern
2636330 because theres something about being in a space that is entirely different from simply a visual reproduction pictures lie they dont tell the whole story
2636331 true an 8 x10 photo of the interior is nothing compared to being inside walking around all my senses were activated sound and smell acoustics i would rather stand on the stage and listen to my own echo than read a list of dimensions about achieving high quality sound
2636332 economically it makes sense sometimes its too expensive to renovate but for the most part historic buildings can be successfully upgraded another thing is the emotional element can you imagine how upset people would be if we tore down and it decreases urban sprawl i mean think about it in the 80s white lakes mall was all the rage then came wanamaker we keep building and building and vacating useable spaces kansas is full of space but we dont need to use it only for property development downtown topeka wouldnt be so dead if we didnt keep moving and expanding and vacating
2636333 i know green is the buzz of the moment but ive always felt strongly about using existing buildings over and over reinvent their purpose we constantly move the center of town its not good enough here so we move it somewhere else people adjust and inhabit and then it moves again its almost obsessive compulsive like we have no patience anymore i think thats one of the strengths of this site the library represents a center which didnt disrupt or disband its community when it renovated

2636335 oh they used a mixture of paint thinned with linseed oil to get that varnish y look

2636342 id have a hard time taking their pictures but shes right though powerful stuff
2636343 but the results are incredible i heard her talking once about how that was the only way she could imagine how people would respond to the loss of our planet putting a face on something as dramatic as irreversible damage to the planet and species extinction she said thats how it feels to her those expressions
2636344 i could have i provoke them all the time but they dont take me seriously it doesnt take much at that age
2636345 kids react that way all the time like its the end of the world over stuff like gum
2636346 no longer shall i paint interiors with men reading and women knitting i will paint living people who breathe and feel and suffer and love
2636347 the historical teapots are more tranquil and inspiring than the modern pots however several such as
2636348 a wonderful display very educational and the reception was wonderful

2636350 i never would have thought of this kind of display
2636351 interesting and lovel can you really put tea in these pots
2636352 my parents from iowa were impressed with this library and gallery
2636353 we reall enjoyed this sara is at shawnee heights high school and is in ceramics our friend lives in china jasmine tea is our favorite
2636354 im always trying to create work that doesnt make viewers feel theyre being spoken down to so that they feel open participation
2636355 youll never get a job in the arts so study something more practical

2636377 they showed a good tempo we have more guys making plays down the field then weve had a in while we have some young guys who have shown the ability to make plays and have shown they arent afraid to make plays you saw williams fiege and casey all make some nice plays tonight
2636378 i thought both taylor and ross showed a lot of poise and made some good plays down the field
2636379 it is something we can build on i thought they both played better in the scrimmage than theyve been practicing which is a good sign they just went out and played and you could see a noticeable difference in them
2636380 now is the time where we will evaluate the first seven practices and evaluate personnel and start looking ahead to what personnel moves need to be made and move to next week

2636383 the digital divide in society is mainly a divide between old and young
2636384 these programs can be a big help to non professionals who dont need business cards that often
2636385 its best to avoid colorful clip art or pixelated pictures
2636386 the card should have a well thought out design and be easy to read
2636387 before you sit down at your pc you should try and imagine what you want the card to look like
2636388 you should remember that everyone has access to these same pre made cards
2636389 professionally designed business cards are a must for mid sized companies and large firms
2636390 that makes these business card packages from office suppliers attractive
2636391 tn film models are popular these screens are in the lower end of the price range
2636392 mva pva and s ips displays hold the advantage here
2636393 ips displays cost around 2 000 euros theyre for people like graphic designers
2636394 its also good if you can tilt the screen forward or backward
2636395 but 15 inch monitors have become exotic even 17 inch models have been driven out of the market
2636396 the viewing angle becomes more important with a wide screen that is near your face

2636409 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
2636410 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2636411 ive been at a few places and theres always some dissent

2636545 its not a tip sheet its a review of the referees performance which every coach every week gets
2636546 its a review to say yeah this referee got this decision right that referee got that decision wrong
2636547 its more or less a check for them coaches as well to fix up areas in their game that we believe in the debrief came up
2636548 so to call it a tip sheet when it suits you is probably a little bit disappointing
2636549 you can call it what you like but thats not what it is
2636550 the bottom line of it all is the referee on occasion does have issues but so does the discipline of football teams in general

2636559 its not a tip sheet its a review of the referees performance which every coach every week gets
2636560 its a review to say yeah this referee got this decision right that referee got that decision wrong
2636561 its more or less a check for them coaches as well to fix up areas in their game that we believe in the debrief came up
2636562 so to call it a tip sheet when it suits you is probably a little bit disappointing

2636641 isasakripisyo nila ang trabaho at kapanakan ng mga empleyado maging ng mga mamamayang pinaglilingkuran ng mga ahensiyang apektado ng paglilipat para mapagbigyan ang mga kapitalistang gaya nina jaime zobel de ayala henry sy sr magkapatid na andrew at lucio tan at si john gokongwei jr

2636647 alam naman natin na sa usapin ng pagbibili ng mga pag aari ng gobyerno naririyan ang mga padulas o mga lagayan para mapadali ang mga transaksiyon hindi lamang inaalisan ng gobyerno ng karapatan ang publiko sa mahahalagang serbisyo dahil sa paglipat ng mga tanggapan nito at ng trabaho ang mga empleyado sa loob ng mga opisinang ito nanakawan pa nila ang taumbayan

2636719 by now summer of 2008 excess deaths from violence in iraq since march of 2003 must be at least a million this conclusion can be reached more than one way there is not much controversy about it in the scientific community some 310 000 of those were probably killed by us troops or by the us air force with the bulk dying in bombing raids by us fighter jets and helicopter gunships on densely populated city and town quarters in absolute numbers that would be like bombing to death everyone in pittsburgh pa or cincinnati oh only the us is 11 times more populous than iraq so 310 000 iraqi corpses would equal 3 4 million dead americans so proportionally it would be like firebombing to death everyone in chicago
2636720 the wars of iraq the iran iraq war the repressions of the kurds and the shiites the gulf war and the american calamity may have left behind as many as 3 million widows having lost their familys breadwinner many are destitute
2636721 but over 500 a month dead in political violence is appalling enough the srebenica massacre in 1995 killed 8 000 at the average rate of death in iraq this winter and spring a similar massacre will have been racked up in 2008 in the northern ireland troubles over 30 years about 3 000 people died and it was widely considered a bad situation that death toll is still being achieved every 6 months in iraq according to the official may statistics and of course by the rule of 11 that death toll would be like nearly 6 000 americans dying in political violence every month or 72 000 a year note that this 72 000 figure would only be political deaths since it does not include criminal homicides the annual total murder rate in the us is about 16 000 including political violence what little there is the us is one of the most violent societies on earth and iraq in may makes it look like a pacifist convention
2636722 at the end of 1943 as war raged in europe general dwight d eisenhower wrote to his commanders in italy clearly expressing his intent to spare cultural property from damage whenever possible today we are fighting in a country which has contributed a great deal to our cultural inheritance a country rich in monuments which by their creation helped and now in their old age illustrate the growth of the civilization which is ours we are bound to respect those monuments so far as war allows this statement and other protective measures for cultural property were a direct result of concerted efforts by governments the military and cultural heritage professionals of many of the allied nations to protect europes cultural heritage during world war ii
2636723 the coalition forces in iraq did not have the kind of m onuments f ine a rts and a rchives units that were present during world war ii while most countries still have civil affairs units few cultural heritage personnel serve in todays military leaving most military commanders without this expert advice furthermore units receive little training on cultural property protection beyond instructions to avoid damage during military operations some european nations maintain civil military cooperation units including a small force of reservists who are cultural heritage professionals however their deployment is often hindered by their nations rules regarding entry into combat areas
2636724 baghdad he works as a blacksmith in one of baghdads swarming shiite slums but at least once a month abu saif tucks a pistol into his belt hops into a minibus taxi and speeds south his goal to unearth ancient treasures from thousands of archaeological sites scattered across southern iraq

2636729 the head archaeologist mohammed yahya said the town is more than 20 000 square meters in area and includes administrative quarters temples and other buildings of magnificent and splendid design yahya who is the head of the provincial antiquities department in the province of diwaniya where the new babylonian town was discovered said he still lacks evidence on the towns ancient name the locals call it shamiya after a provincial district nearby he said
2636730 that his team has come across several cuneiform tablets but there is no one to read the ancient writing because iraqi experts with the knowledge to decipher mesopotamian script have fled the country
2636731 on the 13th of april when i went back to the museum it was as if a hurricane had hit what they could not take they smashed but the main problem was the looting of the archaeological sites
2636732 it is not something we are losing and tomorrow we can buy again it is the memory of the iraqi people the memories of mankind
2636733 heightened public awareness does increase pressure on governments to enforce existing laws and treaties which can help to curb the trade in illicit antiquities from iraq and looted archaeological sites around the world
2636734 by working with dr george and groups around the world safe hopes to again focus the worlds attention on these issues

2636805 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
2636806 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump yeah 10 years from now 2 cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
2636807 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
2636808 people can argue back and forth over who shot first
2636809 if georgian officials request it we will facilitate the transfer within a relatively short amount of time
2636810 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are
2636811 were not talking about anything beyond international diplomacy at this point
2636812 focus into getting our response thought through and then send an envoy into the mediation phase
2636813 its a very localized conflict that appears aimed at threatening the democratic experiment in georgia
2636814 many speculate that part of the reason for the use of disproportionate force is because russia doesnt want to see georgia moving toward nato
2636815 those are some pretty powerful words that are not helping us to end the violence
2636816 how could it be legitimate that any leader in this situation would reject international mediation
2636817 perhaps its trying to make them ice look more humane
2636818 we need to establish the integrity of the immigration system and this is how we can do it
2636819 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2636820 we have concluded based on lab access records witness accounts and other information that dr hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings

2636824 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2636825 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening

2636828 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2636829 the state government wants to find out the source of the massive blackout we need to know exactly
2636830 todo indica que el secuestro de se or boulton tuvo prop sitos econ micos pero ante todo fue un complot contra las auc que pretendi destruirnos pol ticamente narcotraficantes y miembros de instituciones colombianas fueron los responsables
2636831 y aqu viene el m s grande de los errores que se ha cometido en las auc fue la oportunidad que se le dio a los grandes capos de la droga de manipular nuestra organizaci n hasta casi someter a varios de los grupos de las auc mediante fichas claves que se mueven en una frontera difusa entre el narcotr fico y la autodefensa o la defensa del narcotr fico
2636832 casualties of the incident may still rise xinhua reported citing witnesses who
2636833 with these special circumstances and the special background of the eve of the beijing olympic games hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities
2636834 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2636835 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2636836 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2636837 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2636838 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2636839 if someone compatible with me comes along i wouldnt hesitate to give myself a new start
2636840 i promise you i would never do that to you again
2636841 oh look at my hubby making out with another powerful guy thats hot let me play with my tits a little bit
2636842 come on were going to write this book now or else
2636843 retire for what what are you going to retire to a chair
2636844 hey i like this guy and lets go see him more
2636845 i do have to say if i could make records more and do a movie a year that i love and not have to do the movie that i have to make money on id probably be happier
2636846 they used to shoot people for having this much fun
2636847 fortunately in the last few years ive overcome the whole for the most part actor thing because were pretty well respected in the whole americana music world now
2636848 i think one of the things with my solo records is sometimes they werent quite as cohesive up until maybe hobo and beautiful door because i would have like a rock song and then a country sounding song and then a blues song a bunch of different things
2636849 we come out first as the boxmasters with the whole mod suits and everything and play kind of loud hillbilly music
2636850 and then were off for about 20 minutes and everything changes the lighting and the stage set changes and then we come out and do the big rock show
2636851 much like a balance scale the woman is measuring the choices she can make to reduce reuse and recycle
2636852 the tree upon her head symbolizes the environmental issues that weigh heavily on all of our minds
2636853 its very ambitious the melodies are lennon and mccartney and the song structures are kind of all over the place its homage to all my indulgences
2636854 and there was a moment when something clicked inside that made me aware of myself that allowed me to watch myself playing from the outside up to then play had been unconscious
2636855 the difference between an actor and anyone else is that awareness of the playing
2636856 one of the great pleasures of my work is to impersonate others to hide myself behind those guys
2636857 hes not doing anything funny with his hair hes not paralyzed hes playing an almost generic european stud but because its bardem hes doing it with a lot more shadings than weve ever seen before
2636858 he looks like a caveman and has the soul of an aesthete he can be self deprecating and he can be brutal he can play comedy or tragedy he can play a great artist or a peasant and be completely convincing in either role hes the whole package
2636859 the book is based quite a bit on the theory of co evolution
2636860 which is the idea that wolves and later dogs are what made us the dominant species on the planet that we evolved because of them and they evolved because of us
2636861 we made dogs and dogs made us some of the genetic research is fairly controversial but there is some evidence that wolves and humans have been together for 150 000 years and other evidence that suggests it could have happened before we were even fully human
2636862 i have to admit the reason i went into the arts was that i was a really good student in english and a fair student in science it has worked out well because i love science at the conceptual level but i get to a certain point where if there are unknowns i get very frustrated
2636863 and whats fun about being a fiction writer based in science is that when people dont know the answers you get to make them up
2636864 jesses work appealed to me because it contains so many unexpected combinations
2636865 it really represents the great dialogue that can occur when artists explore beyond their own culture
2636866 a typical representative of his race being just sufficiently below the white mans standard to be coddled into doing anything that this manager might suggest
2636867 i get a kick out of getting in tough places
2636868 perhaps the unrelenting duress is what caused benders face to often seem devoid of life
2636869 in several surviving photographs his stare advances the notion that he knows something you dont and that something isnt good
2636870 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2636871 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2636872 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2636873 yes i will concede that conan will enjoy increased ratings not for long though
2636874 just as conan is settling in boom jay leno returns on another network conan will kiss it goodbye at that point
2636875 even while working on the show i was among those predicting his cancellation the poorly delivered jokes the lack of chemistry with andy the conceptual comedy sketches that got few laughs etc
2636876 over a decade later conan not only survives but to my students with no memory of carson and only a fleeting idea of how great letterman was in his heyday on nbc hes the king of late night
2636877 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2636878 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2636879 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2636880 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2636881 i want to thank you first do you know how good it feels to help someone you love one of my best memories of the past year is helping you through this thanks for giving me the chance
2636882 the saddest time in his whole career was when you left
2636883 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2636884 do they not want me there because hell we dont want to talk about giving up a home run to barry bonds as the only thing worth talking about in nationals history
2636885 then they signed mo vaughn and it got a little pricey
2636886 we are hoping that what they have said about having their loan book secured by first mortgages is true but we have seen all this before
2636887 we have been pounding the trustee for the last three weeks with inquiries to find out what is going on but not receiving a huge amount of help
2636888 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2636889 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year

2636891 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal
2636892 now next time you are expecting will be easy well just schedule a c section at around 38 weeks well all be prepared and you dont have to bother about going into labor
2636893 the time might not be too far away where if the international game continues to grow where the players might be contracted to a controlling body
2636894 i am going to explore that i think if we can do something along that line then we are heading in the right direction but to do it you have to generate the revenue
2636895 i made up my mind at 24 0 against us

2636897 i dont talk a lot when i dont have to
2636898 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2636899 wow i wish i could see hundreds of cheesy christian t shirts all in one day
2636900 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2636901 he changed speeds and hit his spots he gave them a chance to win
2636902 this new superbug is something that we really need to be scared of
2636903 we know you are an incompetent fool are you really sure you want to do that you ignorant peasant
2636904 there is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened
2636905 oh my god oh my god i will be right back
2636906 el problema de ser famoso es lidiar con los paparazzis y los chismes
2636907 i think one of the biggest challenges is that most social media efforts are performed in isolation that they are not seen as part of an overarching business strategy
2636908 wanna get big watery shiny eyes without any surgery crave and envy no more
2636909 ive reached the stage where my lawyer my broker my allergist and my president are all significantly younger than i

2636922 when allah decreed the creation he pledged himself by writing in his book which is laid down with him my mercy prevails over my wrath
2636923 allah mighty and sublime be he says the first of his actions for which a servant of allah will be held accountable on the day of resurrection will be his prayers if they are in order then he will have prospered and succeeded and if they are wanting then he will have failed and lost if there is something defective in his obligatory prayers the lord glorified and exalted be he will say see if my servant has any supererogatory prayers with which may be completed that which was defective in his obligatory prayers then the rest of his actions will be judged in like fashion
2636924 credo di poter dire che dal tipo di modalit questo attentato sembrerebbe pi ascrivibile al fondamentalismo musulmano allestremismo fondamentalista che non al pkk
2636925 difficilmente si pu pensare a una turchia stabile senza la risoluzione della questione curda per paradosso uno dei pochi risultati positivi della guerra in iraq stato proprio lavvio verso un auto governo da parte dei curdi delliraq tutto questo come sappiamo ha reso molto nervosi i militari turchi ma se lo si analizza con una sufficiente lungimiranza un kurdistan autonomo in iraq consente di attaccare meglio la frangia dellirredentismo curdo violento che opera in turchia e a spingere anche i curdi della turchia verso un auto governo che non passi per la violenza e lutilizzo della lotta armata chiaro che il raggiungimento dellobiettivo passa per la collaborazione dellautorit turca
2636926 sembra per cos dire che i turchi siano naturalmente islamici naturalmente musulmani il problema che lo sforzo della laicit compiuto da ataturk e dai suoi eredi politici si era gi esaurito la sua capacit di far presa sulla societ si era dissolto da quando erdogan al potere il tentativo un altro lintegrare lislam politico dentro le istituzioni laiche e democratiche e una via diversa per risolvere il problema tra democrazia e islam e credo sia una strada che sia molto importante che abbia successo e che vada incoraggiata
2636927 his attention is riveted in this moment he is not a busy spiritual leader but simply a human looking gravely into the eyes of another in this moment i see his greatness it is this
2636928 humility is not a discipline it is not a practice with him humility is simply what he is i see in this moment of eyes meeting that he is incapable of placing himself above or below me i am stunned by the reality of our equality
2636929 going to go home and burn his jersey and everything remotely resembling the seahawks name
2636930 i knew that that two game losing streak was just a slump i never doubted them not for a second because im a true fan
2636931 kirkuk deve tornare ad essere popolata dalle sue vecchie identit presenti in origine e solo allora tutti insieme si potr decidere sul da farsi la nostra posizione chiara kirkuk parte integrante del kurdistan e siamo ben lieti di veder convivere in pace tutte le etnie presenti in quella regione arabi e curdi assieme le richieste curde sono note e siamo disponibili a lavorare per giungere a una soluzione politica
2636932 ogni popolo del mondo ha diritto alla propria autodeterminazione a combattere per la conquista dei propri diritti e questo vale anche per i curdi detto questo lindipendenza un progetto di lungo periodo occorre riflettere in questo senso sul come e quando procedere attualmente lavoriamo per il rafforzamento dellautonomia per cui c ancora da fare
2636933 oggi il kurdistan pu contare sul 17 delle quote della vendita del petrolio iracheno non ci basta il nostro obiettivo poter arrivare al controllo del 25 30 solo allora saremo soddisfatti siamo favorevoli al ritorno in iraq delle mayor e riteniamo che il paese dovrebbe aumentare decisamente le esportazioni che oggi superano i due milioni di barili al giorno ma dipendiamo dalle decisioni dellopec
2636934 noi non abbiamo paura perch crediamo che se la turchia decidesse di invadere il territorio del kurdistan commetterebbe un passo cos azzardato da creare grandissimi problemi nella zona non credo lo facciano per noi la turchia un paese molto importante dal punto di vista economico ma questo non pu esimerci dal condannare bombardamenti che con lintento di colpire il pkk hanno ucciso civili inermi
2636935 ho da sempre sostenuto che il popolo curdo non deve assolutamente risolvere le questioni con la violenza e le armi ma con il dialogo e la pace in qualsiasi parte del mondo viva riguardo al pkk non posso affermare n tanto meno negare il suo essere un gruppo terroristico qualora il pkk invitato dalla turchia a partecipare a un tavolo negoziale dovesse rifiutarsi solo allora potrei dirle che si tratta di un gruppo terroristico
2636936 e stata terribile ma non credo ci fossero alternative alla guerra lunico modo possibile per liberarci da un dittatore sanguinario e togliergli il potere
2636937 il regime sionista criminale e terrorista che ha una storia di 60 anni di saccheggi aggressioni e crimini alla fine e verr presto cancellato dalle carte geografiche
2636938 il tempo delle potenze tiranniche finito e con la vigilanza e la solidariet tra i popoli gli usa e tutte le potenze sataniche se ne andranno e la giustizia arriver
2636939 possibilit di sviluppo delle relazioni economiche tra italia e iran
2636940 il popolo con noi le dichiarazioni del presidente iraniano su israele non ci impegnano
2636941 perch un patriota in dieci anni poi riuscito a trasformare lesercito e a guidarlo secondo sani principi lo sosteniamo perch ha mantenuto la pace sociale evitando per il libano unaltra guerra civile non stato scelto solo da noi ma da tutte le parti del panorama politico libanese
2636942 e stata una forte reazione da parte di tutta lopposizione ad una vera e propria dichiarazione di guerra contro hezbollah del governo siniora un governo che noi non consideriamo legittimo per la mancanza di una componente sciita al suo interno hanno voluto mettere le mani sulla nostra rete di comunicazione sotterranea che ha permesso di resistere agli israeliani nel 2004 questo stato un diretto attacco alla resistenza abbiamo fatto 18 mesi di opposizione a siniora e al suo governo e neanche quando abbiamo portato in piazza un milione e mezzo di persone ci hanno dato attenzione
2636943 non siamo stati noi a bruciarla ma un piccolo gruppuscolo dellopposizione il partito sociale nazionalista siriano hanno anche issato la loro bandiera dopo essere entrati negli studi tutto il libano al corrente di questo hezbollah sempre stato per la molteplicit dellinformazione e ha invitato subito gli amministratori della televisione a riprendere le trasmissioni e cos avvenuto
2636944 quello che dice il risultato di una deformazione della nostra immagine hezbollah non altro che un movimento di liberazione il suo compito difendere il paese da qualsiasi aggressione nemica dal 92 tutti i governi hanno riconosciuto il nostro ruolo e vedr sar lo stesso per il prossimo la nostra scelta non quella di conservare in eterno il possesso delle armi e non questa la nostra forza abbiamo un largo consenso tra la gente combattiamo la corruzione offriamo servizi e una mano ai diseredati difendiamo tutti i libanesi non solo gli sciiti
2636945 assolutamente abbiamo accettato la risoluzione 1701 che ha messo fine al conflitto con israele unifil di grande aiuto limportante che non interferisca con le questioni interne del paese
2636946 hezbollah da tanto tempo sta facendo un appello alle nazioni unite al mondo arabo e a tutte le organizzazioni internazionali per la liberazione dei molti libanesi che sono stati rapiti dal nostro territorio durante linvasione israeliana e ancora non sono stati restituiti sono in prigione in israele da 23 anni mentre i soldati israeliani lo sono solo da due noi leghiamo la loro liberazione a quella dei nostri credo sia cos per ogni conflitto
2636947 io non posso dare dettagli solo il segretario generale del partito hassan nasrallah in stretto rapporto con gli organi di sicurezza pu dare le giuste risposte io posso dirle che guardiamo a questo sequestro anche con un occhio alla questione umanitaria
2636948 quanto dichiara ahmadinejad non ci impegna per nulla sono sue parole e riguardano solamente lui noi auspichiamo che palestinesi ed ebrei vivano assieme pacificamente per attenzione spesso linformazione deforma la realt si estrapolano frasi da un discorso pi articolato personalmente riconosco lolocausto degli ebrei ma allo stesso tempo ritengo che a volte lo si strumentalizzi per giustificare loccupazione dei territori palestinesi da parte di israele
2636949 teaching a large first year course at a british university i am fed up with correcting my
2636950 all the data suggests that there are more and more students at university level whose spelling is not up to scratch
2636951 di questi incontri se ne sono svolti tanti anche in italia
2636952 sono aperti a funzionari governativi ex militari e professori se ne sono tenuti a ginevra in canada da varie parti e anche recentemente qui da noi anche questanno
2636953 latmosfera molto cordiale gente che si conosce da tempo sono sempre pi o meno gli stessi personaggi il clima molto pi amichevole e molto meno antagonista di quanto si possa immaginare parlerei francamente di amicizia non facile rendere lidea
2636954 ma sono incontri di cui si discute di tutto e con poche prevenzioni la vera difficolt il delivering il vero problema il risultato il raggiungimento dellaccordo ricordo di incontri in cui si avuto un delivering alto a livello iraniano ma che non ha portato a conclusioni perch cerano troppi ostacoli non cera il clima giusto non cera la volont politica soprattutto da parte americana ma anche europea
2636955 posso dirle soltanto che in alcuni incontri sono state formulate delle ipotesi di compromesso sia sullarricchimento sia sulle verifiche sono stati fatti passi molto concreti ma non c mai stato il sostegno politico definitivo
2636956 sono tutti riservati track two li definiamo ma il governo ne assolutamente a conoscenza faccio parte di un centro di ricerca che con il consenso del ministero degli affari esteri organizza e partecipa a questi incontri di diplomazia parallela
2636957 il cot e quello dei tecno conservatori e dei conservatori tradizionali i riformisti inutile contattarli non hanno peso e utile confrontarsi con i conservatori vicini al leader della repubblica islamica e con gli uomini dellex presidente rafsanjani
2636958 inizialmente fu berlusconi a non voler aderire ora non ci permettono di entrare ufficialmente la motivazione che non siamo un paese che possiede tecnologia nucleare sostanzialmente sono gli europei ad essere contrari alla nostra partecipazione
2636959 e un problema serio ma non in modo cos eccessivo il problema stato ridotto tutto al nucleare e tutto il nucleare allarricchimento lo considero un errore clamoroso
2636960 non mi faccia dire di pi per in futuro potrebbero esserci iniziative europee molto interessanti
2636961 che i siriani sono stati in libano trentanni ma non hanno cambiato le nostre teste sono stati costretti ad andar via dopo una manifestazione di un milione e mezzo di persone il 14 marzo del 2005
2636962 il piano originale non era tanto quello di esportare la democrazia quanto quello di rimuovere saddam hussein
2636963 e poi cera la convinzione successivamente risultata infondata della presenza di armi di distruzione di massa comunque troppo presto per giudicare realisticamente se i costi siano stati congrui agli obiettivi raggiunti
2636964 nellimmediato indubbio che sia stata una strategia positiva ci sono segnali di soddisfazione allinterno del governo iracheno
2636965 e motivo di questo che la strategia di petraeus ritenuta in grado di portare stabilit in iraq specialmente nellarea di baghdad attenzione per la stabilit in iraq una questione molto locale che ha a che fare con le comunit dei diversi luoghi non credo sia tanto corretto parlare di stabilit nazionale c ancora tanto lavoro da fare in questa direzione anche se al quaeda
2636966 avesse subito effettivamente tutti i danni di cui si parla non dovremmo commettere lerrore di dimenticarci di tutti gli altri gruppi di insorti e delle varie sette religiose la sicurezza una questione che rimane aperta voglio dire che se anche al quaeda risultasse sconfitta in iraq questo non vorrebbe dire automaticamente vittoria sarebbe un successo dal punto di vista tattico non dal punto di vista strategico
2636967 lui era l ai tempi dei negoziati con lira la sua analisi molto influenzata da questo la situazione totalmente diversa in irlanda si trattava di un gruppo nazionalista che voleva riottenere un territorio perso con al quaeda le cose sono molto pi complicate parlare con gruppi come lira o hamas relativamente facile sono questioni legate al territorio al quaeda vuole distruggere il modo di vivere occidentale i nostri valori con loro non c proprio nulla da negoziare
2636968 la questione attinente al fatto che da noi in inghilterra una delle priorit assolute mantenere questa relazione speciale con gli stati uniti sembra che blair abbia deciso di partecipare a questa guerra una volta chiaro che lamerica sarebbe comunque andata in iraq ad ogni costo anche da sola non potendola abbandonare in virt di quel sacro rapporto atlantico ha deciso di parteciparvi insomma alla fine
2636969 la fase iniziale delloperazione militare ha avuto molto successo sino a quando saddam stato deposto e gli iracheni si sono arresi fin qui tutto bene poi tre cose sono andate male la prima stata la mancanza di truppe nel periodo seguente al conflitto dovuta alla scelta di rumsfeld di non ascoltare i suoi consiglieri poi la de bathificazione il partito bath era un collante per il paese ne reggeva la struttura globale rimosso il partito tutte queste strutture sono venute meno e il paese caduto in una situazione di totale anarchia il terzo motivo
2636970 ha sempre a che vedere con la mancanza di truppe in questo caso nella fase di stabilizzazione una grande quantit di materiale esplosivo e munizioni che si trovavano in vari siti allinterno del territorio iracheno sono rimasti senza controllo e questo ha costituito un opportunit per gli insorti e per al quaeda di trovare una fonte di armi da usare contro gli americani e i loro alleati
2636971 lopposizione politica da molto tempo che chiede questa commissione dinchiesta
2636972 c stata sempre molta resistenza da parte del governo ma ora che tony blair uscito di scena non credo che gordon brown potr ancora resistere per molto a qualche mese dalle elezioni politiche non mi sembra una scelta opportuna finir per essere strumentalizzata
2636973 ci vuole ancora tempo per questi giudizi consideri che parliamo di un miglioramento di vita rispetto al 2003 non a prima delle operazioni militari ma mi chiedo quanto siamo disposti a rimanere laggi perch continuino a migliorare
2636974 molto presto con il volere di allah roma sar conquistata proprio come lo fu costantinopoli
2636975 spero che abbia imparato che la politica regionale degli stati uniti solo fomentatrice dodio
2636976 c stata effettivamente lofferta di una tregua da parte di hamas
2636977 ma dobbiamo ricordare qual il linguaggio del mondo arabo quello della dissimulazione in questo caso ogni obiettivo per realizzare la cos detta guerra santa lecito compreso il non rispettare alcun accordo e evidente che in un momento di grande debolezza come oggi quello di hamas lorganizzazione ha la necessit di riorganizzarsi e di prendere tempo per preparare poi lassalto finale magari con la complicit di altri stati della regione
2636978 la cancellazione dalla carta di hamas della volont di distruggere lo stato di israele esattamente come avvenne nel 93 fra rabin e arafat il secondo requisito labbandono di ogni forma di azione terroristica e il terzo il riconoscimento degli accordi sottoscritti con arafat in questo quadro
2636979 si innesca unaltra vicenda che un po il paradosso di tutte le vicende che avvengono in medio oriente se anche qualsiasi governante israeliano dovesse decidere di andare alla resa con hamas in un ipotetico accordo di pace questo non farebbe che rafforzare nellopinione pubblica araba e palestinese lidea che israele ha ceduto solo grazie alle azioni terroristiche il risultato sarebbe insomma stato raggiunto pi con la violenza che non con il normale dialogo
2636980 di tregua effettivamente si era parlato dopo alcuni incontri mediati dalla parte egiziana tra israeliani e palestinesi sembrava si trattasse ma proprio ieri israele ha bombardato occupato cinque case e tutto si complicato di nuovo
2636981 hamas fa proposte ogni giorno il punto a quali condizioni quelle poste dal popolo palestinese sono quelle poste da abu mazen a olmert le condizioni di hamas potrebbero avere riscontro solo se il movimento islamico ammettesse il suo errore a gaza e il governo di salam fayyad riprendesse in pugno la situazione se le richieste di hamas fossero quelle di sedersi al tavolo delle trattative questo non sarebbe possibile perch hamas non rappresenta il popolo palestinese
2636982 sono trascorsi quasi tentanni dalla rivoluzione tutto cambiato le generazioni e le loro esistenze oggi forse nella medesima condizione politica non si sarebbe arrivati alla rivoluzione quello che certo
2636983 che la linea di mio nonno era molto diversa da quella che oggi domina limam khomeini credeva in una repubblica islamica non a uno stato islamico come chi oggi al potere
2636984 nei dieci anni in cui mio nonno govern a parte i problemi derivati dalla guerra con liraq non si viveva la tensione di oggi limam permetteva a tutti i partiti politici di essere attivi nella vita della repubblica non esistevano le estromissioni di oggi
2636985 in questi tempi liran sta attraversando il periodo pi chiuso e oscurantista degli ultimi trentanni non naturale artificiale non potr proseguire cos per tanto ancora noi viviamo in unera di grande comunicazione e questo fa s che non sar facile continuare ad opprimere cos a lungo una societ i ragazzi che oggi hanno 13 14 anni tra un p ne avranno venti e loro ne stia certo non sopporteranno i soprusi del regime
2636986 non me ne parli un disastro sono contraria a tutte le posizioni del presidente dalla politica estera a quella interna per non parlare poi delle sue esternazioni sulla donna
2636987 sa cosa ha detto di noi per rafforzare il nucleo familiare necessario che le donne stiano in casa ci vuole fuori dalla societ ha represso la maggior parte delle iniziative femminili e contrastato le principali organizzazioni femministe
2636988 s ha ragione questo governo stato un fallimento con la sua politica economica con khatami linflazione viaggiava sull11 ora ha raggiunto il 20 in questi ultimi mesi i prezzi sono balzati alle stelle i generi alimentari i prezzi delle case sono aumentati di due tre volte
2636989 sa cosa avevano promesso porteremo il petrolio sulla tavola degli iraniani quando prometti e non mantieni la gente non lo dimentica
2636990 ma credo che oggi viviamo in un epoca che ha bisogno di un clima di fiducia e di pace sono sicura che se il mio governo la finisse di interferire negli affari di altri paesi liran potrebbe riacquistare la simpatia della comunit internazionale il paese attirerebbe turisti e stia sicuro muterebbe anche questa disastrosa situazione economica
2636991 voter ma non con troppe aspettative nelle liste riformiste sono stati esclusi importanti candidati conosciuti dalla gente in citt come shiraz qom tabriz le maggiori perdite sa questo cosa ha provocato a parte che i candidati riformisti sono in minoranza poi si dovuto sostituire i non ammessi con nomi sconosciuti la gente non sa cosa faranno se eletti al majles e potrebbe non votarli
2636992 e un tipo molto timido evita per natura lo scontro le racconto cosa successo
2636993 il quotidiano etemade melli riportava i risultati di un sondaggio che dava ali come il pi votato nella sua lista una settimana dopo in televisione nel corso di un programma che presentava le varie candidature il nome di nostro padre fu accostato a quello di un discusso personaggio dellmko un gruppuscolo terroristico stato allora che mio fratello ha deciso di rinunciare alla candidatura non voleva che per questa scelta il nome della nostra famiglia potesse essere infangato
2636994 anche a me piace lomosessualit e spero che un giorno sar possibile viverla anche in iran sostengo la causa di mehdi
2636995 esistono due dimensioni totalmente differenti del fenomeno in iran c la condizione degli appartenenti allalta societ iraniana che vivono la loro sessualit con tranquillit e divertimento e il loro tenore di vita a permetterglielo sono laltro iran quello del nord di tehran grande vita feste private palestre da favola ristoranti e auto di gran lusso per loro tutto vissuto come un sogno non hanno da nascondere nulla anzi tendenza fashion sono sempre in viaggio hanno grande cultura e parlano pi lingue la comunit in cui vivono non interagisce con il regime non ha bisogno di permessi pratiche uffici e burocrazia anzi li protegge isolandoli dai guai
2636996 devono nascondere gioco forza la loro identit sessuale cancellarla potrebbe rappresentare la loro fine in molti casi sono cresciuti in famiglie religiose nellangoscia di rischiare di perdere tutto il dramma maggiore per loro che non riescono a creare comunit non hanno modo di confrontarsi e solidarizzare
2636997 e allincrocio tra le vie enghelab e hafez dove dallimbrunire ragazzi gay si prostituiscono molti di loro provengono dalla provincia di tehran allontanati dalle loro famiglie vivono l la loro disperazione ho conosciuto un ragazzo di rasht un centro vicino al mar caspio mi raccontava di aver cercato mille lavori diversi di averne cominciati tanti sempre abbandonati perch denigrato e disprezzato per il solo fatto di essere gay nel parco tante volte
2636998 il ragazzo era stato fermato e picchiato dalla polizia morale funziona cos se dai troppo nellocchio ti arrestano se eviti di metterti in mostra tante volte ti tollerano
2636999 lessere gay di per s non un reato per la legislazione penale iraniana il problema che quando sono scoperti nel praticare rapporti omosessuali sono perseguiti nella stessa maniera di coloro che praticano rapporti extra matrimoniali con laltro sesso la differenza nella pena gli omosessuali sono condannati a morte per impiccagione gli adulteri alla lapidazione chi fa sesso fuori dal matrimonio viene frustato
2637000 no non mi mai capitato per le dico non avrei potuto comunque far molto la legge islamica lascia poco spazio alla difesa in presenza di testimone o dopo confessione il gay sarebbe comunque condannato a morte non avrebbe via di scampo lunica arma in mano alla difesa limpossibile dimostrazione che il rapporto non sia stato consumato
2637001 sono felice di affermare che siamo finalmente daccordo su unofferta da presentare alliran
2637002 il rapporto delliran con il vostro paese antico e profondo mi auguro che le scelte politiche dei due paesi proseguano in tal senso da parte nostra faremo tutti gli sforzi possibili e sono convinto che le interferenze di altri paesi non riusciranno a crearci problemi io non mi preoccuperei per questo
2637003 vedo il presidente ahmadinejad almeno due volte a settimana i valori spirituali e morali sono fondamentali nelle nostre scelte governative e io sono il suo consigliere culturale
2637004 non vero non esageri non ne sono stati esclusi poi cos tanti hanno partecipato hanno avuto un ruolo attivo e tanti di loro saranno seduti nel prossimo parlamento io ritengo che la prossima legislatura possa riservare alliran un libero e proficuo dibattito per il futuro del paese
2637005 il problema che il golfo persico molto piccolo e le navi che attraversano le sue acque sono tante troppe ogni tanto tra le navi iraniane e quelle di altri paesi succedono piccole scaramucce solo via radio per avvertimenti e minacce ma mai scontri ne siamo abituati ormai sono anni che succedono
2637006 sono a roma da tre giorni con pensatori e religiosi iraniani e cattolici abbiamo partecipato in vaticano a dialoghi interreligiosi un confronto quello con la santa sede che dura da pi di ventanni
2637007 discutiamo di modernismo pluralismo educazione dei principi della pace e della giustizia delle giovani generazioni di verit amore e libert lultimo dialogo era dedicato al rapporto tra fede e ragione nellislam e nel cattolicesimo e ci ha onorato della sua visita il pontefice benedetto xvi
2637008 liraq una terra importantissima per la grandi risorse petrolifere che contiene a mio avviso la presenza americana lunico grande problema vogliono gestire tutto dallestrazione alla vendita del petrolio e nonostante i tanti soldati morti le innumerevoli vittime innocenti irachene non desistono la comunit internazionale dovrebbe aiutare veramente liraq consentendo a quel popolo di gestire autonomamente il suo futuro
2637009 tutti sanno per che il nostro utilizzo del nucleare pacifico abbiamo subito pi ispezioni di qualsiasi altro paese le nostre attivit rientrano appieno negli accordi sottoscritti con liaea solo linteresse nazionale che ci spinge a proseguire su questa strada
2637010 che non sono arrivati ora cerano anche prima hanno gi governato e i rapporti con loro sono stati sempre ottimi spero possano continuare cos noi c la metteremo tutta
2637011 la nostra risposta agli attacchi dei riformisti che la disoccupazione diminuita non certamente aumentata per diminuire linflazione
2637012 noi abbiamo un piano e lo attueremo consideri che una gran parte dei ricavi della vendita del petrolio li abbiamo investiti per lo sviluppo delle infrastrutture del paese e chiaro e naturale che ci provochi un po di inflazione
2637013 le posizioni italiane sono secondo noi tra le pi realistiche in europa le consideriamo relativamente vicine alle nostre idee anche se non sempre sono state dello stesso tenore mi auguro che dalle prossime elezioni italiane possano esserci cambiamenti favorevoli allassunzione di scelte indipendenti dagli stati uniti noi auspichiamo che litalia non sia seguace degli americani
2637014 visto che il maleducato presidente bush ha invitato il popolo iraniano a disertare le urne noi presentiamo 30 illustri candidati che sapranno dimostrargli quanto siamo forti a perseguire i nostri principi
2637015 mi chiamo roshanak siasi sono attivista di kargozaran da quindici anni sono presidente nella regione di gilan vicino al mar caspio
2637016 secondo le nostre previsioni a tehran parteciperanno alle votazioni tra il 45 e il 50 degli aventi diritto nel resto delliran forse si superer il 60 la speranza che almeno 50 60 candidati riformisti possano entrare in parlamento abbiamo problemi nel controllo dei mass media a parte due quotidiani non ci resta altro radio e televisione ci sono avversi abbiamo poco per farci sentire
2637017 spero la si finisca di avvalersi della religione per emozionare ed eccitare la gente farle perdere la testa per poi utilizzare le loro menti ad arte per altri fini e poi mi auguro che liran riacquisti il senso del comune maturi nel perseguire lo sviluppo dellintera comunit che cominci a considerare limportanza della ricchezza della molteplicit a discapito dellarricchimento individuale
2637018 in effetti il primo raggio di sole dopo un lunghissimo periodo buio per il libano
2637019 conosco benissimo questo paese ci ho insegnato in libano non esiste certezza quello che oggi ti sembra in un modo dopo qualche ora totalmente modificato intendiamoci
2637020 laccordo in s una gran cosa un punto darrivo la questione vera capire al di l della forma quanto sostanzialmente abbia incassato hezbollah intendo il comprendere perch il movimento sciita abbia firmato laccordo ma questo
2637021 le due parti hanno proclamato la propria intenzione di condurre i colloqui in buona fede e con apertura e di mantenere un dialogo serio e continuato allo scopo di giungere a una pace generale secondo quanto prefigurato nella conferenza di madrid
2637022 i sionisti hanno perso la loro determinazione poich hanno dovuto affrontare i musulmani la cui fede incrollabile
2637023 chi si trovato su posizioni politiche contrastanti deve tornare a essere fratello parlamento e governo devono sostenersi a vicenda perch entrambe le istituzioni appartengono agli iraniani
2637024 dobbiamo lavorare insieme per risolvere i problemi economici del paese una qualsiasi decisione avventata ci farebbe infatti perdere altro terreno

2637046 el mercado mundial de alimentos se enfrenta con dos fuerzas arrolladoras al mismo tiempo una que quiere empezar a sustituir el petr leo cada vez m s caro con ma z girasol soja y otros cereales y otra china e india que requiere imperiosamente de alimentos para su inmensa y creciente masa de trabajadores
2637047 la agencia de noticias afp realiz un ilustrativo relevamiento en algunos mercados europeos tomando como referencia informaci n de organizaciones de consumidores por caso en alemania el pan aument entre el 5 y el 10 por ciento y la manteca subi de 79 centavos a 1 19 euro en los ltimos tres meses en espa a la leche trep 11 por ciento mientras que en polonia el litro de leche descremada pas de 0 40 a 0 60 euros en italia las pastas y en francia la tradicional baguette se dispararon generando jornadas de insurrecci n de los consumidores en china la tasa de inflaci n se elev al 6 5 por ciento en agosto el porcentaje m s alto en once a os impulsado en gran parte por el alza de casi 50 por ciento en el precio de la carne de cerdo en forma sencilla la conclusi n es que hay un grave problema no s lo en argentina puesto que lo que est en cuesti n con la agflation es lo que se conoce como soberan a alimentaria la accesibilidad de los alimentos por precios calidad y cantidad para la mayor parte de la poblaci n

2637060 es necesario partir de la base que no hay hechos o acontecimientos puramente econ micos sino m s bien socio econ micos biol gicos y ambientales y que para estudiarlos conocerlos interpretarlos y actuar para resolverlos es necesario hacerlo con un enfoque integral hol stico que rebasa largamente la mirada unidimensionl del economista hay que traspasar los l mites que separan a las diferentes ciencias naturales de la econom a rompiendo la compartimentaci n de los saberes e integrarlos en un nuevo enfoque enriquecedor la econom a ecol gica
2637061 la tradici n hist rica es por as decirlo de ayer en ning n lugar hemos superado realmente lo que thorstein veblen llam la fase predatoria del desarrollo humano los hechos econ micos perceptibles pertenecen a aquella fase e incluso las leyes que podemos obtener de ellos no se aplican a otras fases ya que el prop sito del socialismo es precisamente superar y avanzar m s all de la fase predatoria del desarrollo humano la ciencia econ mica en su estado actual puede arrojar muy poca luz sobre la sociedad socialista del futuro
2637062 la sociedad sigma una teor a del desarrollo econ mico
2637063 en el proceso de desarrollo econ mico de los pa ses las condiciones iniciales son importantes es decir
2637064 bolivia tiene cientos de a os de explotaci n minera y es el pa s m s pobre de am rica latina al igual que todas las localidades del pa s en donde operan las mineras m s importantes
2637065 las empresas mineras proponen que esta discusi n se d en el marco del estudio de impacto ambiental eia sin embargo el proceso de los eia mineros no goza de mucha credibilidad en el per la calidad de muchos estudios ha sido cuestionada los mecanismos no permiten una participaci n ciudadana oportuna e informada y en m s de una d cada ning n proyecto minero de mediana o gran envergadura ha sido desaprobado por nuestras autoridades si bien las leyes tienen que ser respetadas los conflictos parecen indicarnos que existe la necesidad de revisar y perfeccionar los mecanismos de evaluaci n de proyectos mineros m s a n en ecosistemas como el descrito
2637066 el caso de tambogrande a 85 km de piura ha sido una situaci n paradigm tica de contradicci n entre lo global y lo local
2637067 el de tambogrande es tal vez un caso nico en el mundo nunca he visto una explotaci n minera dentro de un valle f rtil
2637068 durante mis 30 a os de experiencia nunca he visto convivir agricultura y miner a y a pesar de la tecnolog a moderna siempre hay contaminaci n
2637069 en todo el tiempo que vengo investigando nunca he visto el caso de una convivencia perfecta entre agricultura y miner a cuando se construye un tajo abierto las rocas se exponen al aire y los elementos que contiene forman cidos ars nico cadmio mercurio sulfuro eso es una reacci n natural con un tajo grande hay una exposici n de la roca tambi n al agua puede haber filtraci n al agua subterr nea porque el r o est muy cerca as podr a afectar su calidad
2637070 miner a y desarrollo en el per con especial referencia al proyecto r o blanco en piura
2637071 esto significa que los efectos potenciales de r o blanco en el ambiente y el desarrollo no pueden ser analizados independientemente del impacto de este distrito minero m s amplio
2637072 en lo que respecta al ambiente el impacto de la mina tal como est dise ada actualmente podr a ser manejable si bien para asegurarse de ello se requerir a una evaluaci n de impacto ambiental conducida con los m s altos est ndares y un monitoreo independiente
2637073 existen evidencias de que la compa a no contaba con el permiso legal correspondiente de las comunidades de yanta segunda y cajas para operar en sus tierras
2637074 el informe de la defensor a del pueblo emitido en noviembre concluye que el caso muestra deficiencias cr nicas en relaci n al gobierno y regulaci n de la exploraci n minera en el per sostiene que estas deficiencias socavan derechos humanos y ciudadanos garantizados constitucionalmente particularmente de los pobres en reas rurales cuyos derechos son ya vulnerables la defensor a del pueblo concluye que la implementaci n del proyecto r o blanco ha violado los derechos de propiedad de los comuneros sus derechos para determinar de qu modo ser utilizado su propiedad y sus derechos a tener una participaci n informada en las decisiones vinculadas al desarrollo concluye tambi n que estas violaciones a sus derechos derivan de la falta de claridad de las regulaciones y pr cticas del ministerio de energ a y minas mem y que ste habr a tenido conocimiento de que se estaba violando estos derechos a partir de la informaci n que minera majaz le proporcion en el momento que le dio luz verde para empezar la exploraci n a gran escala el caso se ha vuelto emblem tico de profundas deficiencias del mem y de la incapacidad de las poblaciones locales para hacer algo al respecto la delegaci n concluye tambi n que este caso muestra dram ticamente c mo la protesta no violenta y el proceso democr tico han decepcionado completamente a las poblaciones locales esto resulta peligroso en el per y ayuda a explicar porqu los grupos locales optan por la acci n directa y c mo surge la violencia en torno a conflictos mineros
2637075 quienes sostienen que la miner a es la v a para el desarrollo econ mico local apelan a tres cadenas causales principales la primera opera a trav s de los efectos multiplicadores de la miner a en el mercado laboral y en el mercado productivo la experiencia peruana lleva a pensar que esta cadena causal es relativamente ineficaz para promover el desarrollo local la segunda cadena opera expl citamente a trav s del programa de desarrollo social que promueve minera majaz aqu el argumento es que este programa al apoyar los sistemas empresariales y de producci n locales aumentar los ingresos y el empleo locales actualmente el programa no parece muy diferente a otros programas de desarrollo rural y comunitario que han tenido efectos desalentadores sobre la dimensi n econ mica de la pobreza en los andes como ahora es ampliamente reconocido la tercera cadena causal es la menos directa pero es de la que m s se habla y opera a trav s del canon minero aqu el supuesto es que las minas pagar n impuestos y regal as que las autoridades locales utilizar n para invertir en desarrollo sin embargo actualmente las capacidades de estas autoridades son sumamente restringidas y la legislaci n obstaculiza que estos recursos se traduzcan en desarrollo adem s las tasas de las regal as parecen ser bajas respecto a los est ndares internacionales
2637076 frente por el desarrollo sostenible de la frontera norte del per
2637077 resulta contradictorio que el gobierno nacional denuncie la supuesta ilegalidad de la consulta vecinal y no haya mecanismo alguno frente a la presencia ilegal de la empresa minera majaz
2637078 como bi logo he llegado a esta conclusi n hemos alcanzado un punto
2637079 no tiene el objetivo de aplastar al contrincante como se hace normalmente en algunas pol micas sino que quiero darle un sentido persuasivo amical y pedag gico y cuyas consecuencias sirvan no s lo para los polemistas en mi caso tengo mucho que aprender sino para nuestros alumnos nuestros colegas y todo aquel que est interesado en el tema

2637082 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2637083 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2637084 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2637085 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2637086 john mccain was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine

2637112 rudely interfered with chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti china hostile forces
2637113 my presence in beijing will confirm it once more the friendship between france and china is a fundamental axis of frances foreign policy
2637114 they say we create a negative image they treat us like refugees and criminals
2637115 they are cracking down on us more than ever before they regard us as enemies who will disrupt the stability of the country
2637116 they ask us to embrace the olympic games to love the country love the party but they dont love us
2637117 as the beijing olympics draw daily closer all kinds of anti china and hostile forces are further intensifying their activities to create disturbances and carry out sabotage by any means
2637118 our enemies will do whatever they can to sabotage the beijing olympics they will even resort to extreme violence
2637119 tougher implementation of visa rules in recent months has already sent the number of tourists arriving in the chinese capital plummeting
2637120 zero mass petitions to beijing zero petitions to provincial capitals and no mass incidents during olympic games period
2637121 the government only knows this method and they are only good at this method to deal with dissent
2637122 may control the situation temporarily but its not the way to solve the problem fundamentally
2637123 much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the olympics but actually because of the olympics in an apparent attempt to portray a stable or harmonious image to the world by august 2008
2637124 why were the people of wengan so angry as to set fire to government buildings how could a citizen turn so violent after a single regular police interrogation does the removal of an illegal structure have to end up in hatred the three tragic episodes reveal a less than harmonious relations between the general public and those who are supposed to be at their service
2637125 as the peoples republic of china prepares to host the 2008 olympic games its 1 3 billion people can take pride in what they have accomplished in the three decades since they jettisoned maoist ideology and embraced market forces to develop their economy
2637126 setting the record straight social and economic achievements under mao
2637127 the dynamics of chinas rise are complex there is however a shaping contradiction dependency and growing economic strength china is dependent on foreign capital and foreign markets but china has also emerged as a world economic power a center of world manufacturing it has accumulated vast foreign exchange reserves and gained considerable financial leverage increasingly over the dollar and china is more aggressively seeking markets in the third world and exporting capital beyond its borders
2637128 the u s still occupies the primary position in the imperialist world economy it is the largest economy the financial glue of the whole world system and the political military guarantor of a global order that benefits at least for now all the big powers
2637129 the u s s economic position in the world has been declining but u s imperialism possesses unparalleled military strength relative to rivals and would be rivals and since 2001 it has been pressing this advantage mounting a global military offensive focused in iraq and afghanistan to secure unchallengeable dominance for decades to come

2637142 it is important to remember however that much of the ground for conflict between culturally differentiated grouops is not cultural but a competition over territory resouresem or jobs
2637143 consequently the failure to repeat normative behavior as the constitutive feature of subversive performativity may actually enhance the system rather than threaten it
2637144 duzak analyzed research introductions in polish and english academic journals and golebiowskis 199 study dealt with psychology journal writing finding many textual and stylistic differences these findings showed that the english texts used more direct assertive and positive positions
2637145 i n well meaning explanations meant to showthe legitimacy of different styles of argument across cultures hatim ends up generalizing about preferred argument patterns and like hinds 1987 who analyzed japanese english contrasts hatim can become an easy target for those who object to cross cultural analysis because of the danger of stereotyping

2637157 the idea that filipino farmers must plant exportable crops has always been proven as destructive to the economic backbone of the country which is agriculture and threatens the capacity of the farmers to conduct their activities sustainably meaning really beneficial to them and friendly to the environment
2637158 let us be reminded that only the capitalists and their cohorts were able to benefit when rice corn coconut and other indigenous crop farmers shifted to planting pineapples cavendish bananas and crops that are export oriented let us not be deceived by these sugar coated analysis because we have the best weapon to counter them and thats experience
2637159 would be to improve the composition of expenditure without necessarily increasing its level
2637160 the country would be able to seize new opportunities presented by the global markets by shifting expenditures towards supporting dynamic high value added products with export potential
2637161 more than 40 percent of the philippine labor force is employed but which now contributes only about 14 percent of national output
2637162 it is appalling to hear someone encourage filipinos to supply food to other countries when many filipinos are suffering from hunger and poverty because of lack of food while we recognize the potential of the country to host agricultural farms these farms must foremost serve the interest of the filipino people and not other any other countrys interest
2637163 we have already seen how producing food for other countries like the united states and japan have made our local farmers suffer almost irrevocable damages let us put an end to this kind of scheme that only impairs the filipinos capacity to agricultural self reliance
2637164 unta dili lang hangtod sa estorya ang ilang pagkakita ug kabalaka sa nagkadaut nga kinaiyahan ug saad nga mupanday sila ug mga balaud nga nagtinguha nga maproteksyonan ang kinaiyahan sa among bahin isip usa ka grupo sa kabatan unan kami nagahulat nga makita sa konkretong mga butang ang ilang mga saad apan asa na man ang ilang agenda alang sa kinaiyahan karon
2637165 dako man ang among paglaum nga ilang tumanon ang ilang saad apan unta dili na nila dugayon samtang anaa pay panahon unta mabatian na namo karon dayon samtang anaa pay panahon
2637166 the abundance of mt tipolog has been helping the lumad in terms of livelihood and agriculture and knowing this the people there are aware that the mountain must be protected against intrusions that will only mean destruction on the natural landscape and the resources that feed them
2637167 it is important for the public to know about this especially with the looming entry of certain developments that will only in the end cause the destruction of the mountain
2637168 our lumad brothers and sisters are now suffering because of the greediness of some people over the wealth of the mountains and the forests we know how the lumad were dislocated from their ancestral lands because of developments that only benefited a few people
2637169 as people living in the lowlands we believe and fully support the efforts of the lumad living at the foot of mt tipolog to develop the area according to their culture and tradition we will climb tipolog as a way of protesting against efforts of few people to milk money from the environment while the lumad are left out in poverty
2637170 their exposure to these deadly chemicals weakened their immune system and because of this they are susceptible to many kinds of diseases including tuberculosis
2637171 i wouldnt be surprised to know more cases of tuberculosis among the employees because tuberculosis remains to be one of the common diseases in the country but are you not wondering that despite our exposures to people with tuberculosis we dont have tuberculosis thats because our immune systems are not yet weak
2637172 we have a right to health and a healthy environment their right to the use of their property should be subservient to the right of the general public
2637173 ug protektahan nila ang eskwelahan kinahanglan pud nga maproteksyonan ang mga mag uuma nga anaa nagpuyo sikbit sa ilang buhaton nga plantasyon

2637177 erred in issuing its order since in actions questioning the constitutionality of an ordinance petitioners must have at least shown a strong case to overcome the presumption of validity in the courts mind which petitioners failed to do as ruled by this court
2637178 as a matter of fact witness for petitioners in the person of maria victoria sembrano a certified public accountant testified and admitted in open court that manual spraying is one of the methods used in spraying fungicides in bananas other than aerial and that manual method of spraying can be resorted to anytime
2637179 with the admission by the said witness petitioners claim that to shift from aerial spraing to some other modes of applying fungicides within three months is physically impossible is obviously misleading highly implausible and glaringly nugatory
2637180 petitioners themselves admitted as shown by the quoted declarations of witness sembrano that they can actually avail of manual spraying in lieu of the aerial method at anytime such being the case it perforce follows that the ordinance is actually not unreasonable neither oppressive nor confiscatory
2637181 with due respect erred in holding that the three months period within which to shift to some other modes of applying fungicides as mandated by the ordinance banning aerial spraying is unreasonable
2637182 first it was a mistake to have indicated that petitioners has a vested right in embarking into a vast multifarious investment such right being merely a properly right which can be subverted by police power of the state
2637183 second it has not clearly indicated what substantial right and interest the petitioner have to be protected as it was merely in anticipation certainly not its property rights which was failed to be substantiated during the preliminary injunction hearing finally the court failed to indicate in its order what was established by the petitioners during the hearings to validate its issuance of preliminary injunction
2637184 there is a need to grant the writ of preliminary injunction prayed by the petitioners anticipating a certainty of grave and irreparable damage and injuries the petitioners will suffer if the remedy is not granted to ensure the protection of substantial right and interest if petitioner recognizing its vested right in embarking into a vast multifarious investment

2637190 we see this is as a desperate act of political accommodation what have become of this government that everyone appointed into office are those who do not have the appropriate credentials and background and nothing but unquestionable loyalty to the administration
2637191 cant this government for once select someone to head denr whose background fits well to the position and can perform and deliver the demands of environmental protection in the face of various threats confronting the environment dont we have anybody else in whom we can put our full confidence and trust that she or he will be working on policies that are not against the environment
2637192 orders like this are biased to companies which are known for being environmentally destructive this worse we can get with people at the denr who in essence do not have the heart for environment and its protection when reyes also sat as the head of denr the unfair and destructive order of defensor came in full swing inviting more and more foreign mining corporations and agricultural companies to invest in the country
2637193 the filipino people deserve better and well qualified people to lead them and we hope that the president will consider this as she will also realize that the condition of the environment is so alarming already that agencies like denr must be composed of the correct people
2637194 please give the people of davao a favor give up this fight and for once show that a small part of you is willing to practice your corporate social responsibility respecting the city government who passed the ordinance and the lower court who ruled against your case is your only chance to show that theres another part of you other than being greedy and arrogant
2637195 enough of all these denials this is the best time to admit that aerial spraying is hazardous and therefore must be banned stop denying yourself and the public of the truth that you have lost the battle and will lose even if you will bring it up to the higher court if it is corporate pride that backs up your insistence the people with confront this with our implacable strength all the way through as we have shown in the past
2637196 the favorable ruling has all the more strengthened the resolve of the people even as pbgea remains in complete denial the people who have been exposed to aerial spraying all these years are all the more unbending this time
2637197 all members of maas are as ready as before we will not hesitate to report any violations to the city government
2637198 what is found by the court through their petitioner witnesses are not impressive to provide merit of credibility but on the contrary general observations and obscure presentation of their respective testimony not convincing to establish the fact on issue
2637199 the details of the testimonies of witnesses for petitioner furnish sic major inconsistencies as to destroy all probable aspect of what is there to accept in their testimonies
2637200 when confronted with the label of the fungicide dithane he admitted that his company dow agrosciences european development center has warned the public users of its dangerous effects to the health of human being with a disclaimer of responsibility of the company in case any untoward incident resulting in the adverse effect of said fungicide sic
2637201 his admission of the dangerous effect of fungicide in itself is enough to put the public to be aware of the said immediate danger poised by the particular fungicide
2637202 on the merit of her exposition theories and studies of fungicide reflected in her excellent qualification as a doctor of medicine and a pharmacologist along with her renowned qualification as a toxicologist by clearly putting into understandable presentation her thesis that all fungicide are poisonous and pose outright danger to the health and safety of human beings and the surrounding environment
2637203 mainly anchored and invoked the inherent power of the government supported and expressly provided in the time honored general welfare clause of the local government code of 1991
2637204 the exercise of police power is productive of a constitutional principle of social justice
2637205 the state shall provide social justice in all forces of national development along with said declaration the state shall protect and provide the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them
2637206 after a very extensive review and careful evaluation of the voluminous records submitted arguments and complicated positions from the parties the court cannot sustain the theory and position of the petitioners in assailing the validity and constitutionality of the subject city ordinance
2637207 there is indeed not only a necessity but a strong demand of urgency for the passing of said city ordinance in keeping with the stringent obligations of the government to answer the call of the people in accordance with the invoked general welfare clause of the public
2637208 in the greater extent for consideration the court arrived to affirm and sustain the validity and constitutionality of the subject ordinance not only on the basis purely of legality but as already stated true indeed there are questionable factual matters in the presentation of the witnesses of the petitioners that preponderate the evidence
2637209 what is paramount for upholding the validity and constitutionality of the subject city ordinance is the presumption that it is valid and constitutional and such presumption will remain unless certain basic principles will prove to be repugnant and contrary to the specific provision of the constitution and law
2637210 im so glad youre sitting there in that chair right now
2637211 if you start raising prices ill gouge your eyes out

2637228 i appreciate other peoples right to fly the flag but i also appreciate my right to burn it and i dont want to lose that
2637229 a while ago when i was really in need of some comfort in my life ann kottner said something very important to me just keep going and act as if
2637230 we had our worst fears and our greatest hopes and the reality exceeded our greatest hopes
2637231 like we had been away for about three months dust but just a slight layer
2637232 it feels like completely different city down here its a war zone there are military checkpoints and you have to carry id theres no food no mail no power on tv they tell us to go on tell us life is normal but theres no way
2637233 the first thing my wife did was grab all the photo albums the first thing i did was grab all documents passports checkbooks etc then we grabbed the pets and out we ran we only had ten minutes as we got to the stairway and the guard was congratulating us on how efficient we had been in our allotted ten minutes we looked at each other in horror we forgot clothes the guard let us back in for four minutes trying not to chuckle too loudly
2637234 without even thinking twice i had her come home with me i now have a new friend
2637235 no te levantes por la ma ana esperando que sea un buen d a

2637245 ich ermahne euch nun liebe br der dass ihre eure leiber darbringet als ein lebendiges heiliges gott wohlgef lliges opfer das euer vern nftiger gottesdienst
2637246 gib dein bestes dem meister nichts anderes ist seiner liebe w rdig
2637247 alle eure sorge werft auf ihn denn er sorgt f r euch
2637248 denn ich wei dass in mir das hei t in meinem fleisch nichts gutes wohnt wollen habe ich wohl aber das gute vollbringen kann ich nicht denn das gute das ich will das tue ich nicht sondern das b se das ich nicht will das tue ich wenn ich aber tue was ich nicht will so tue nicht ich es sondern die s nde die in mir wohnt
2637249 kommt her zu mir alle die ihr m hselig und beladen seid ich will euch erquicken
2637250 wie lange willst du mich verfolgen ich bin f r dich gestorben und habe f r dich mein leben gegeben
2637251 ich entdeckte eine schlimmere art von heidentum als bei uns die menschen beten sich selbst an sie lesen nicht die bibel und beten nicht materialismus und intellektualismus haben die herzen hart gemacht
2637252 wer nicht w hlt w hlt die die er nicht gew hlt h tte wenn er gew hlt h tte
2637253 w hrend meiner ersten jahre als christin hatte ich schwer mit negativen gedanken zu k mpfen ich wusste dass negative gedanken negative gef hle und negative erlebnisse nach sich ziehen und tat mein bestes dagegen anzuk mpfen sie kamen jedoch immer wieder nachdem ich wieder einmal einen vortrag ber die macht negativer gedanken geh rt hatte fragte ich den seelsorger frustriert was man denn tun k nne wenn diese immer wieder zur ckk men der mann verbl ffte mich mit der antwort ach das ist ganz einfach ersetzte sie durch positive gedanken es reicht nicht sich negativen gedanken nur zu widersetzen so wie sich jedes vakuum bei der n chsten gelegenheit f llt sei es auch nur mit wasser oder luft so geschieht es auch mit deinem denken solange dein gedankenhaus nicht besetzt ist mit neuen konstruktiven gedanken werden die schlechten gedanken immer zur ckkehren entscheide dich bewusst daf r an gute aufbauende dinge zu denken wie gott es dir in der bibel zeigt dann finden die negativen gedanken keinen platz mehr in dir seitdem entscheide ich mich tagt glich bewusst f r gottes gedanken ich habe begriffen dass es meine aufgabe ist diese wahl zu treffen
2637254 liebe freunde ich m chte das gerne erkl ren ihr habt mich um euren applaus gebeten den psalm noch einmal zu wiederholen aber als mein freund fertig war seid ihr still geblieben wo der unterschied lag ich will es euch sagen ich kenne den psalm aber er kennt den hirten des psalm
2637255 ich sehe dich wie einen getreidehalm im sommer du bist gut gewachsen und aus deinem leben soll einmal etwas werden zum wachstum geh rt sonne regen und wind hast du dir schon einmal berlegt wie ein so schwacher getreidehalm eine so schwere frucht tragen kann
2637256 sieh dir diesen knoten an der gibt dem halm die stabilit t je mehr knoten ein halm hat umso tragf higer ist er die knoten wachsen nicht alle zehn zentimeter sondern sie entstehen nur in den kalten reifn chten je mehr reifn chte ein halm erlebt hat umso stabiler wird er
2637257 ich glaube dass gott genau wie wir zutiefst traurig dar ber ist doch wir m ssen eins klar sehen seit jahren weisen wir gott aus unseren schulen aus unserer regierung und aus unserem leben und da er ein gentleman ist glaube ich hat er sich still und leise zur ckgezogen wie k nnen wir erwarten da gott uns segnet und sch tzt wenn wir doch von ihm verlangen dass er uns in ruhe l sst
2637258 wie k nnen wir erwarten dass gott uns segnet und sch tzt wenn wir doch verlangen dass er uns in ruhe l sst
2637259 lieber gott warum hast du das m dchen nicht gerettet
2637260 lieber besorgter sch ler ich habe hausverbot in schulen mit freundlichen gr en gott

2637263 i never bothered with the directors who did the dramatic parts of the pictures most of the times id never even see them
2637264 they did their job and i did mine of course my sections were more expensive we once figured out they cost about 10 000 per minute on the screen and people yelled about that but i hollered em down
2637265 i just tried an app called dvdfab decrypter which just failed a rip so wont be using that i have been told that i cant use dvd decrypter which sucks cos it did everything i wanted every time
2637266 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2637267 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2637268 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2637269 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2637270 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2637271 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2637272 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2637273 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2637274 unlawful proposals that would jeopardise its bid to build the national broadband network
2637275 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices ms gillard told abc television
2637276 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2637277 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices she said
2637278 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2637279 the middle east infrastructure and resources are creating a mountain of work
2637280 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2637281 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2637282 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2637283 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2637284 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2637285 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2637286 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2637287 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2637288 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2637289 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2637290 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2637291 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2637292 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2637293 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2637294 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2637295 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2637296 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2637297 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2637298 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

2637309 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers mr james said
2637310 the oil price being down 5 a barrel is certainly going to weigh down the energy sector although banks should continue to do well
2637311 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2637312 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2637313 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2637314 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2637315 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2637316 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2637317 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2637318 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2637319 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2637326 more to add this description is just of the top of my head
2637327 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2637328 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2637329 union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2637330 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2637331 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2637332 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2637333 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2637334 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2637335 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2637336 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2637337 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2637338 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2637339 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2637340 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2637341 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2637342 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2637343 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2637344 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2637345 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2637346 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2637347 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2637348 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2637349 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2637350 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2637351 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2637352 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2637353 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2637354 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2637355 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2637356 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2637357 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2637358 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2637359 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2637360 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2637361 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2637362 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2637363 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2637364 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2637365 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2637366 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2637367 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2637368 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2637369 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2637370 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2637371 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2637372 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2637373 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2637374 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2637375 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2637376 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2637377 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2637378 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2637379 who are open to doing something on the production side
2637380 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2637381 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2637382 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2637383 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2637384 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2637385 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2637386 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2637387 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2637388 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2637389 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2637390 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2637391 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2637392 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2637460 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2637461 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge

2637526 thats what i was doing at the start of the year i kept getting closer and closer
2637527 but when i got back from omaha i looked at the tape and i noticed i was 3 or 4 inches closer to the plate so what was happening was that a lot of balls i figured id hit off the barrel i was actually getting jammed on i was getting jammed all the time
2637528 not really because you can get away with stuff like that in the minors
2637529 i never used to think about it when i was in the minors the margin of error is greater
2637530 but up here pitchers notice everything and they will pitch you differently it really is a game of inches when i back off with my stance i can still reach the outside corner but i hit more balls off the barrel
2637531 what i have noticed in watching him this year is that hes in much better shape physically
2637532 and hes not one of these soft guys from the islands i saw him come charging home and just run over a catcher i mean knocked him out cold shoulder first
2637533 i saw him make three or four diving stops to his left and right he may not have great range but he also can scoop it at first hes making big strides there
2637534 i look at it i still cant believe its me
2637535 i still dont see him as an everyday major league player
2637536 i still see a slow bat but i hope im wrong because hes a guy you root for
2637537 its something that has helped me im pitching every two or three days every relief pitcher if he gets consistent time on the mound can be better
2637538 hes throwing his fastball on a downhill plane hes working both sides of the plate and that is helping his secondary pitches
2637539 i know what i did last year i can pitch here i just had to prove it to myself
2637540 i treat a four hit game the same as an oh for four game
2637541 once the game is over its over and you cant do anything about it you cant get too happy or dwell on the bad game

2637674 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2637675 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2637676 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2637677 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2637678 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2637764 i thought id go quicker at the end of the day it was a tough race not much i can do about it now i wish i could have gone quicker

2637766 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth unless they smoke drink or have different colored skin
2637767 the numbers for each of these nights have been similar suggesting preferences are stable
2637768 generally speaking the structure of the race remains as it has been since early june with obama holding a modest advantage over mccain
2637769 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2637770 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2637771 you know there are a lot of things we cannot control the thing we can control is ourselves try to deal with it try to be strong
2637772 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them
2637773 when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2637774 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2637775 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2637776 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2637777 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2637778 that was probably the hardest bout ive ever fenced in my career
2637779 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2637780 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation

2637789 now beijing is a city combined with modern and traditional elements the busy shopping malls and endless traffic is more or less the same in the wall street of new york city but we can still find many traditional cultures like teahouses courtyards and quadrangles
2637790 we would rigidly close all high polluting factories to ensure the health of athletes and the success of the olympic games
2637791 it is great to promote hong kong as a hub for filmmaking and it will certainly bring to our industry some insight and experience
2637792 batman has swoops in hong kong so the demand of batmans products have slightly increased
2637793 theres a 10 business growth in our shop during the film shooting
2637794 i think there would be some benefits to hong kongs tourism as the shooting of batman has chosen hong kong as a place for film shooting because when the people get to see the film they may try to find out more about hong kong and it may certainly attract them to come
2637795 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2637796 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2637797 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2637798 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2637799 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2637800 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

2637806 he was a young man ready to go somewhere in the world
2637807 i want to know the answer he is never sick he hasnt even got a family doctor is it something hereditary
2637808 we want to know so it isnt passed to his son what do we write on his death certificate
2637809 he got a tissue and wiped his fathers nose when he was lying in a casket downstairs because that is what his father did to him

2637814 in my experience the term excited delirium has been used exclusively by law enforcement and in the legal world
2637815 it is a term that is to the best of my knowledge developed by a non medical group i e the law enforcement and legal community and therefore yes it doesnt fall into what would be legitimate medical science
2637816 even though the american medical association does not recognize this diagnosis as a medical or psychiatric condition the national association of medical examiners has recognized it for more than a decade it is used by medical examiners in most major cities thus there is a great deal of controversy regarding the use of this syndrome to explain sudden death while restrained
2637817 i have had much reservation about this so called entity for many years the forensic pathology community is split on this
2637818 as far as i am concerned it is not an entity that exists in and of itself
2637819 one could theoretically argue that the state of excitement induced by a confrontation may produce death
2637820 in the absence of drugs in my opinion this is pure scientific conjecture it is a fiction that has created by a combination of medical examiners coroners forensic pathologists in those offices district attorneys law enforcement officers
2637821 it gets them out of a difficult situation many times when you have these deaths occuring following police altercations in which there was no weapon in which the person has no heart disease in which there was quote erratic behavior unquote
2637822 the ama and the american psychiatric association do not recognize this entity in the year 2008 its been discussed now for many many years certainly it has been revisited by the appropriate experts in these two national organizations and i am with them i do not recognize it or accept it at all in the absence of drugs
2637823 i look at it skeptically but im willing to review it when drugs are present specifically cocaine and amphetamines and other drugs that can alter behavior but not in a central nervous system depressant fashion
2637824 you cannot ignore the fact that nine out of ten of these cases involve victims who are members of a minority and cops who are white
2637825 its a more acceptable way of saying almost like its gods will in other words its something we could not have prevented hey man he just got excited in a state of delirious excitation he died we dont really know why we dont understand why we cant demonstrate anything at autopsy
2637826 its convenient and you need something you can sell and you know what to the public generally out there hey man its another one of those excited delirium cases too bad
2637827 how come we dont have excited delirium cases absent cocaine amphetamines et cetera in situations that do not involve the altercations with police
2637828 they only seem to die when the altercation is with the cops its never an altercation with their brother in law with their neighbor
2637829 according to a study by merrilee zetaruk of the pan am sports medical center in canada based on data collected largely from the 1990s the number of injuries in competitive womens gymnastics were as high as 200 per 100 gymnasts per year
2637830 when i compared the denon dvd 3800bdci with the transport i saw immediate improvement the performance with 1080p 24 blu ray playback looked better than any other players ive seen to date
2637831 it provided incredible detail and definition i find it really hard to compare players with blu ray playback because they all look excellent across the board however when i watched the dvd 3800bdci on my front projector system the denon edged out other players i had on hand in both depth and fine detail
2637832 the performance with standard dvd was also first rate many blu ray players lack great dvd playback capabilities and this is the first player i would recommended to replace your higher end standalone dvd model the performance fell in line with denons flagship dvd 5910ci which is one of the best dvd players ive ever tested
2637833 the dmp bd50 offers full 1080p 24 support with blu ray and upconverted dvd playback
2637834 blu ray playback looked excellent and in line with the best players ive seen the notable exception to this is the denon dvd 3800bdci which looked a tad crisper than the panasonic
2637835 unfortunately the dmp bd50 falls short in standard dvd playback
2637836 i hope panasonic offers a full 7 1 channel analog output in a future model i would also like to see it improve in the speed department
2637837 the bd p1500 did a great job with 1080p 24 blu ray playback it presented the high quality image that we expected from blu ray players
2637838 since samsung doesnt use a high end video processor the bd p1500 lacks the ability to properly convert 1080i to 1080p regardless of the cadence this only affects a limited number of titles on the market today mostly concert videos but it is still something you should consider if youre looking for a complete high performance blu ray solution
2637839 the bd 1500 did have an anomaly that i havent seen on any other blu ray player for some reason the menus looked slightly blurry
2637840 letters lacked their usual sharpness and menus exhibited a bit of haze and lack of contrast while this didnt affect movie playback it still became a distracting oddity
2637841 standard dvd video performance far better than i expected most blu ray players offer mediocre dvd performance compared with the better dvd players on the market but the bd p1500 performed remarkably well with my testing it offered high end deinterlacing performance and better than average scaling quality i dont think it offers quite the performance of samsungs more expensive bd p1200 which used silicon optixs hqv processing but it worked better than majority of players near this price point most people will find this to be a suitable substitute for almost any dvd player on the market
2637842 without a doubt the bd p1500 is the fastest standalone blu ray player ive used while it isnt quite as fast as sonys playstation 3 the load times were faster than the other players in this roundup and ones i used before
2637843 it moved at speeds that were more in line with what ive come to expect from the ps3 its great to see a manufacturer start to make some real strides in this department
2637844 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
2637845 no frenchman could be persuaded to play more than once a cricketer in france is a stranger in a strange land looked upon with mingled awe and contempt by the average frenchman

2637851 i swear to the mother of baal you cant make up stuff this bad its like the self congratulation and the self contradiction are competing with each other
2637852 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2637853 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2637854 theyll probably see the highlights and i think theyll understand hes a great kid and hes had a great camp so far he can make plays hes got speed hes a great football player
2637855 he knows how to get in and out of his routes and obviously he knows how to catch the ball chris johnson has another level of speed and hes going to help us
2637856 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2637857 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2637858 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2637859 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page

2637863 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
2637864 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
2637865 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
2637866 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2637867 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2637868 the people in this town have been through so much loss this year and my heart goes out to them
2637869 theyve stood by me they gave me a sold out show youve got to pay it forward in life thats all i did in cedar rapids
2637870 i try not to date where i work it makes life easier
2637871 i dont say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but theyd have to be pretty extraordinary

2637877 he asked me if i would open a drama centre so i went there and there was a plaque for the drama centre that had paul weiland on it
2637878 it was amazing because no one at my own old school would ever say heres a pupil thats done well maybe we should bring him back to inspire the other kids and these people dont know me from adam all the kids wanted my autograph
2637879 he drank in the local pub paddys he just joined in at the bar like a local he didnt want to be seen as a big hollywood star
2637880 he was very down to earth and mixed with the locals and the farmers he was very well liked
2637881 you are a disgrace to the man race its time to run like a real man

2637888 were interested in performing more often this is a once a year thing we could use more of it
2637889 its going to be a great concert a lot of fun everyone has a wonderful time experiencing this beautiful music
2637890 het leek wel of we gisteren nog met elkaar hadden gewerkt

2637940 i was kidnapped by russian soldiers and held hostage for 3 years
2637941 hey we miss seeing the latest photos of your kids or pets and want to hear about what hi jinks have been going on in the family
2637942 supermarket companies all over the country are watching arizona with bated breath
2637943 what safeway and wal mart and tesco and many other people are really experimenting with is whether this small store concept can work
2637944 theres really a question about whether they are able to provide the kind of assortment that consumers want
2637945 obviously we watch the market regardless of whos entering it
2637946 well leave comparisons to you when the stores open this fall
2637947 tesco has probably been more successful with its international acquisitions and growth than wal mart has
2637948 tesco has probably taken more time to actually understand and evaluate the local culture wal mart has tended to be a bit more bullish
2637949 i cant imagine going into business and not having any idea what other people offer
2637950 i think you have to know what youre up against
2637951 initially we found that their sales were actually running around 50 000 a week
2637952 each week were seeing an increase of customers were seeing larger baskets were seeing more repeat customers and more new customers and thats across the board at all of our stores
2637953 marketside is a smaller neighborhood market providing customers convenient access to fresh high quality food
2637954 the stores will range in size from 10 000 to 15 000 square feet and carry everyday favorites fresh ingredients and a wide selection of affordable meal solutions
2637955 wal mart is going to have a very intriguing product that i think is more likely to be successful with americans because they know americans better
2637956 however tesco has a more dying need to succeed than wal mart does they really would like to diversify their sales into the largest market in the world it would help their stock price a great deal its quite likely that even if there are big obstacles theyll keep investing and keep trying to transform and not give up
2637957 i dont know that it matters as much to wal mart
2637958 theyve opened a few of those and are gradually growing the chain but basically wal mart found that they can earn a higher return on investment by building more super centers
2637959 the most likely result is that it will turn out that americans in fact like all their existing retailers and this will be a tiny niche that will wind up being 2 or 3 percent of the market
2637960 you can go and buy convenience food and its pretty disgusting fresh amp easys idea is good value good quality products in a service friendly environment
2637961 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2637962 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2637963 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else

2637995 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 seeing everybody so close together
2637996 its usually not how it is after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point coming home in the freestyle its all adrenaline

2638021 the psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious it happens outside as fate that is to say when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves

2638038 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2638039 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2638040 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2638041 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2638042 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2638043 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2638044 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2638045 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2638046 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2638048 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2638049 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2638050 today is going to be a long day were gonna need mr snuggles
2638051 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2638052 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2638053 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2638054 and we have told our people that others might have to go as well
2638055 iema illinois emergency management agency guys want them to go
2638056 they will task you to towns or to a break on a levee
2638057 with this flood we need every able hand to help out
2638058 so if youre not doing anything else and youre in the national guard youre being called for flood duty
2638059 if the levees were to give away you dont need people down there
2638060 im not saying they will but there is a possibility they the levees could be weak
2638061 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2638062 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2638063 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2638072 saya pikir dengan dihukum seberat beratnya saja dia sudah jera karena tak bisa lagi menikmati hasil yang dikorup
2638073 nah kalau memang perlu dihukum mati ubah saja uu nya dengan diharuskan semua hakim memvonis mati pelaku koruptor

2638083 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2638084 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2638085 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2638086 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

2638146 shall not affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict
2638147 you will see that the recognition of belligerency is an obsolete legal institution which was not even a generalized and accepted practice but rather an instrument of the policy of the usa in the southern american affairs at the turn of the 20th century i have always been amazed at the importance given to this subject by both parties referring to the grp and ndf in the philippines sad enough the application and respect of ihl even in its fundamental principles have been made more difficult because of this unnecessary political requisite
2638148 in practice the traditional international law on recognition of insurgency and belligerency is more theoretical than real
2638149 of mere historical interest is the notion that the government of a state engaged in a conflict may recognize the insurgents as a belligerent party such a declaration was last made during the boer war 1902 recognition of the south as a belligerent in the american war of secession was only tacit
2638150 much of the case law on belligerency derives from wars of independence in south america in the 19th century in a post 1945 context this model is no longer wholly adequate
2638151 today these recognition regimes have been replaced by compulsory rules of international humanitarian law which apply when the fighting reaches certain thresholds

2638229 i was always interested in the holocaust but i never thought i would have a passion for studying it
2638230 both my professors were incredible their passion was tremendous and it transferred to me
2638231 going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills up my body right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have the first one under my belt
2638232 im happy to get the first race jitters sort of out
2638233 flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions
2638234 we could not have asked for a better result today three american flags being raised on the first day of the fencing event so i am just really really proud and really happy
2638235 it is really everybody my goal is just to be as prepared as i can be and if i am then i will be satisfied
2638236 we have 12 confirmed dead at this time multiple injuries weve had helicopters and ambulances from the metroplex and the surrounding area assisting in transporting the injured to the hospitals
2638237 we got the call about a quarter til midnight and sherman fire dept they asked us to come out and bring cold water and drinks and snacks
2638238 this is the biggest thing ive come across where weve helped the city personnel as well as rural volunteers i mean we saw people as far away as bryan county come to help with the situation
2638239 just pray for them hope everything okay but we heard i mean about 13 people died so that very badly for us
2638240 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2638241 when you get older you start wanting to come home

2638245 this is a great slice of america here in ohio
2638246 when you talk about the early days of america and the patriotism that it invoked i believe you have a big pulse here that you can put your finger right on and say this is america
2638247 people always stand up when i sing american songs and thats great its a great time
2638248 were still one nation under god and thats good news in the u s a today
2638249 i have a variety of patriotic shirts and flags that i fly but generally at a nighttime show ill wear white because it reflects the light
2638250 it was a great tribute to america great for the depot and a great family event i hope they can do more of this
2638251 it came off perfect the weather was great there wasnt a hitch and i havent heard a single complaint
2638252 while remaining true to letter structure the artists let the letters overlap and interlock adding extensions off the letters such as serifs and breaks or gaps in the letters
2638253 throw ups over tags simples over throw ups pieces over simples productions over pieces
2638254 you have to bring your a game you dont put anything on top of a production unless you can top it

2638256 people have been incredibly patient who cant stand in their living rooms and have a civil conversation
2638257 my wife sits outside on the deck and pretends it sounds like the ocean
2638258 we have no other reason to we love our house
2638259 its the first time ive really felt like they are
2638260 i know looking around driving through town there appears to be a lot of vacant homes
2638261 people are foreclosing on properties its a very sad amount i find it sad
2638262 im assuming they took out mortgages much higher than they could afford its typical of the whole market
2638263 we have a great deal of abandoned property that could provide a dangerous situation for the neighborhood or emergency response personnel
2638264 does it look real nice no but i got people to protect
2638265 we found a lot of people did not return the census this year and ive heard that is true for a lot of other communities as well we clerks found that was odd
2638266 its a problem and a challenge we take very seriously the potential is certainly much greater with foreclosed properties
2638267 its obviously in the towns best interest that homes be fully occupied
2638268 i cant say were not seeing the economic downturn but i think we have 65 total pieces of property available in millis thats not much
2638269 i cant say that if you put your house in the market itll sell next week
2638270 homes are selling theyre just selling more slowly were not dying on our feet not us
2638271 there have been a few more than in the past but market values dont seem to be as affected by the downturn of the market
2638272 we dont seem to be as far off on values as the general perception for central and eastern massachusetts
2638273 its not a huge issue in ashland but every town needs some list
2638274 they were very infrequent previously but like the rest of the country we have problem areas
2638275 i do think thats high but it stays around that number
2638276 i dont want a police officer i dont want anyone in one of these buildings until its turned or sold and properly maintained
2638277 if there is a good side its that were finding this stuff
2638278 as the weather gets colder were going to have squatters
2638279 its a shame it used to be a nice house

2638281 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2638282 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2638283 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2638284 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2638285 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2638286 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2638287 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas

2638295 regressive encephalopathy brain disease with features consistent with autistic spectrum disorder following normal development
2638296 enforced uniformity confounds civil and religious liberty and denies the principles of christianity and civility
2638297 if we accept that god is love and that it is human beings who are to respond to this love the explanation is simple love cannot be forced ordered or made obligatory it is necessarily free if god liberates it is because he expects and hopes that we will come to know him and love him he cannot lead us to do so by terrorizing us
2638298 expectations are one of the dominant ways that we attempt to control our lives our relationships and god

2638304 californias largest union local and a related charity have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to firms owned by the wife and mother in law of the labor organizations president documents and interviews show
2638305 the los angeles based union which represents low wage caregivers also spent nearly 300 000 last year on a four seasons resorts golf tournament a beverly hills cigar club restaurants such as mortons steakhouse and a consulting contract with the william morris agency the hollywood talent shop records show
2638306 in addition the union paid six figures to a video firm whose principals include a former union employee
2638307 labor unions constantly have to battle the usually false perception that they misuse funds and face a well funded right wing campaign that seeks to undermine unions for even the slightest error most unions including those ive been a part of are very scrupulous about how they use money to avoid even the appearance of impropriety so i am very surprised to hear that this was going on
2638308 how about we both go on 60 minutes a few days after the dhs starts patting down montana drivers license holders who are trying to get on the planes and both of us can tell our side of the story

2638314 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2638315 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2638316 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2638317 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2638318 but it is important to note that both are in the early stages of development
2638319 have more fans pulling air out of the case then pushing into the case
2638320 there are ndas that prevent us from talking about new and upcoming cards but as you can guess developments are constant and nvidia is no slouch perhaps i can answer some questions about the fully available gtx 200 line that i would suggest you look into the price perfomance support of nvidias and especially evgas lineup cannot be beat
2638321 hes played extremely well in green bay a couple of years ago he played outstanding i have nothing but the highest regard for chad he is an extremely bright guy the knock on him was his arm wasnt that strong so what i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game i play in it doesnt matter hes very effective
2638322 if there is a situation that comes up i will definitely look at it but it has to be something with the pats
2638323 there is no sense in me going to another locker room when i have my guys in that locker room that are going back and hopefully trying to finish what we started

2638327 rakyatku semua rintangan demi rintangan telah kita lewati dan atasi satu langkah lagi kita akan menunaikan tugas dari allah untuk yang satu ini karena saya yakin ini cukup berat kita harus dibagi dalam kelompok atau regu

2638330 ah kamu rupanya mentari begini kami mendapat tugas dari allah untuk mengairi wilayah di tengah padang pasir ini rintangan demi rintangan telah kami lalui tapi untuk yang satu ini kami tidak dapat menerjangnya sudah separuh dari anggota kami lenyap ditelan pasir ini sekarang kami kehabisan akal dan tak tahu harus bagaimana

2638350 for each of these questions for which there is no natural answer you have a proof of god
2638351 piye was the first of the so called black pharaohs a series of nubian kings who ruled over all of egypt for three quarters of a century as that countrys 25th dynasty
2638352 nubians are clearly noted as the ones who ruled egypt during the pramid years
2638353 i noted that they ruled during the pyramid building years
2638354 like which famous pyramids i havent seen any evidence of intensified pyramid building during those 75 years out of the thousands of years of egypts history
2638355 yeah the mets farm system is decimated they have nothing
2638356 namun manusia tak mampu menjagaku maka lebih baik aku mematikan diriku saja

2638361 we expect the death toll to rise because rescue workers have just begun to reach affected areas where communication was very limited
2638362 we have mobilized militiamen and soldiers to rush food aid to people
2638363 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2638364 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2638365 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2638366 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2638367 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2638368 tired of traditional media broadcasting the humdrum sanitized g rated media coverage of the olympics if so then here is the unofficial smart mobs a list of 8 alternative ways to experience olympic coverage this list which should please your appetite and curiosity for understanding what is really happening in beijing right now
2638369 well point out some areas where it has worked perhaps better than anticipated
2638370 well point out some areas where we think it should be changed or improved but well lay out for them issues we think the owners would raise if we were to terminate the cba we will lay out the facts im not advocating for the guys theyre smart guys its their call
2638371 if the ruling is the nhl contract is valid and the khl chooses not to recognize it im sure youre going to see an icy relationship between the nhl and the khl
2638372 they do not want to lose their better players particularly leading in to the olympics its our position that if a young player wants to play in the nhl they should have the right to do so
2638373 if the iihf backs the nhl the ball is squarely in the khls court there are a whole lot of international issues we will be meeting about in september we think the emergence of the khl is positive because it gives guys such as ray emery and chris simon another chance to play do i think it will mean nhl players rush to siberia no
2638374 i thought coming into the race i was getting very nervous and trying not to think about being in the olympics and i just tried to focus on the race
2638375 im always interested in new delivery systems for stories and always curious about how those systems work with the old storytelling verities this one it seems to me works extraordinarily well
2638376 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
2638377 why are you defending a society that was built on slavery
2638378 the confederate soldiers were poor men tricked by rich slave owners into thinking they were actually fighting for freedom
2638379 if some people find the confederate flag offensive just take it down whats the big deal the south lost get over it

2638381 it was really good i was happy with the swim
2638382 it was good to get one race under its been a long process since last months u s olympic team trials and hopefully there are more good ones to come
2638383 ive got 40 other swimmers from america im swimming for
2638384 and no matter how many people are in the stands when i hear them cheering for me i get the same feeling
2638385 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2638386 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2638387 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2638388 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2638389 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2638390 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the back stroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2638391 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2638392 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2638393 i think the best tech site of all time is
2638394 i ride my scooter almost every day unless it looks like rain today was no exception a mostly sunny day in the low 90s i had a little time to kill on my lunch hour today so i decided to take a little ride around town
2638395 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2638396 i think furious would be a good way to describe it she didnt understand we both went through a process of trying to figure out how it happened why it happened
2638397 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2638398 none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2638399 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2638400 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2638401 our singular objective is to play warhammer online day and night till the servers in mythics headquarters catch fire and burn down their offices

2638404 it the eu presidency demands an immediate ceasefire it welcomes the offer of the ceasefire from georgia and expects from russia that it will immediately accept such a ceasefire
2638405 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2638406 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2638407 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2638408 we have not received through any channels any appeal from the georgian leadership to the president of russia
2638409 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2638410 but i do support saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2638411 the european union and nato must take up the initiative and oppose the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe

2638453 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2638454 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2638455 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2638456 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2638457 beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before
2638458 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2638459 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2638460 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone

2638465 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2638466 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2638467 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2638468 i am pretty happy about that that was a pretty emotional race today

2638476 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2638477 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2638478 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2638479 it is clear the situation is dire i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2638480 diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia
2638481 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2638482 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2638483 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2638484 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2638485 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

2638490 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2638491 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2638492 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2638493 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2638499 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2638500 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2638501 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2638502 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2638503 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2638504 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2638505 funny how its ok for griese to dink and dunk down the field
2638506 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2638507 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2638517 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general

2638531 clearly there was anxiety about what sort of model we should have to move towards a republic
2638532 there will be a day in this nation im absolutely confident when we will be a republic
2638533 but labor is taking this in a measured way we understand that ultimately this is a matter that the community needs to settle a view on
2638534 im not a great fan of the word narrative but i can tell you very easily what this governments about
2638535 its about designing and implementing the long term plans that matter for this nations future
2638536 and foremost amongst them is making sure that weve got a productive and prosperous economy for the future
2638537 ex prime ministers have a licence i think to say what they want about contemporary politics paul exercises that licence from time to time so does bob hawke and i imagine so will john howard

2638541 underscore this 11th hour bid to save the nations greatest river
2638542 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up
2638543 they need to secure water upstream and send it down
2638544 there was a real sense that enough is enough now theres no more excuses now its got to happen
2638545 the problem is there isnt the political will currently in the labor party
2638546 they have the power to do it its about having the guts to do it
2638547 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon

2638551 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2638552 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2638553 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2638554 we expect the death toll to rise because rescue workers have just begun to reach affected areas where communication was very limited
2638555 we have mobilised militiamen and soldiers to rush food aid to people
2638556 green technology is smart technology not just because everyone says it or not just because its a social responsibility but because it makes pure economic sense
2638557 its all about the bottom lines cash is king and the largest capital expenditure organisations deploy is going towards it hardware costs will come down when this will deliver into bottom lines we are saving now on what we deliver from the bottom lines
2638558 if we can dimension storage to handle peak loads it has to operate in a way that it is just sufficient for applications to handle non peak loads thus saving energy by operating in two different ways
2638559 the meeting will definitely take place but if progress can be made if we are out of the meeting then we will not attend it
2638560 they should be flexible in their stand and help us resolve the issue
2638561 we now look to the russian government to accept this offer and agree to an immediate ceasefire in line with its international commitments to respect georgian territorial integrity
2638562 right now the joint ceasefire committee is thrashing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is threshed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire
2638563 we used to have two drivers now we only have one because we only use one car
2638564 my parents are too old to commute so they use the car
2638565 each car once cost around 2 500 pesos a month in gas
2638566 now thats how much it costs a week so one car has gone from 2 500 to 10 000 pesos a month multiply that by three and you get 30 000 pesos we just cant afford it anymore
2638567 my life is now being limited to a five kilometer three miles radius if i drive
2638568 its cheaper just 100 pesos and you have a full tank
2638569 strain on the mrt line is approaching a critical level
2638570 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
2638571 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2638572 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth

2638609 with its infusion with the american idiom our ever changing language has never been richer and yet it does not seem that the word is the same tool for the dramatist that it once was is it that we are living in an age of images is it even that we must go through a period of image saturation for the need for language to re emerge
2638610 there are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples
2638611 paul barber wrote a book called vampires burial and death
2638612 he gives a forensic interpretation of vampire incidents theyre a natural phenomenon that wasnt understood by the people at the time because they didnt really know what happens to the bodies under different conditions his definition is that a vampire is your classic scapegoat i think his definition if i can paraphrase it is something like a vampire is a corpse that comes to the attention of a community during a time of crisis and is taken for the cause of that crisis
2638613 the way you look personally is the way vampires have always been portrayed in folklore like walking corpses which is what you are at least in the later stages of consumption skin and bones fingernails are long and curved you look like the vampire from nosferatu
2638614 everett heard the story from people who had been there at the exhumation of mercy brown who were alive at the time
2638615 the newspaper providence journal says they exhumed all three bodies that is mercys mother her sister who had died before her and mercy everett said they only dug up mercy he implied that there was some sign that mercy was the one thats the supernatural creeping into his story everett said that after they had dug her up they saw that she had turned over in the grave but theres no mention of that in the newspaper or the eyewitness accounts
2638616 theres a suggestion in the newspaper that she wasnt actually interred in the ground
2638617 she was actually put in an above ground crypt because bodies were stored in the wintertime when the ground was frozen and they couldnt really dig when the thaw came they would bury them so its possible that she wasnt even really interred
2638618 they examined her organs the newspaper said her heart and liver had blood in it it was liquid blood which they interpreted as fresh blood
2638619 they cut her heart out and as everett said they burned it on a nearby rock then according to the newspaper they fed them the ashes of the heart to edwin
2638620 she basically absorbs the ignorance the fears and in some cases the guilt that people have because their neighbors friends and family are dying and they dont understand why and they cant stop it
2638621 folklore always has an answer it may not be the scientifically valid answer but sometimes its better to have any answer than none at all
2638622 the government provides the timber zinc for the roof and iron while our group provides technicians and skilled labourers as a donation
2638623 its like they are building their own house but combining our skills with their labour

2638816 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
2638817 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
2638818 how do you learn to redeem yourself from a mistake how do you learn to overcome that on the inside and continue being a compassionate person
2638819 i think that many people pick up along the way that life is about destination so they are taught it is about arriving its about having all the answers its about creating a nice box that you can sit in and defend but my fundamental understanding is that life is a journey and journey is a fundamentally different way to understand life than destination and on a journey all i am responsible for is the next step and thats all im ever asked for is the next step i dont have to have it all figured out i dont have to defend it all i dont have to have it all nailed down and if you can shift from destination understanding to journey it frees you to take life as it comes let it be what it is and then do the next right thing
2638820 when you dont know where youre going any road will take you there

2638869 the share of food fuel and heating in our budgets is much higher than in more developed countries and its precisely those goods whose prices have risen most
2638870 when consumption rises too suddenly that creates ideal conditions for price rises
2638871 but we shouldnt count on a rapid fall in inflation
2638872 my pension after a working life of over 30 years is 4 100 kroons 262 euros 405 dollars and i have to pay out around half of that for my two room apartment during the seven month heating season
2638873 life is not easy but i try to manage i choose what i buy carefully

2638952 when galway went two up in the second half we did look in trouble
2638953 to a man our lads responded and it was a fantastic second half performance by both teams
2638954 we would have had the greatest respect for galway galway are probably the purest footballers in the country theyve always played great football
2638955 there are no green shoots of recovery in the irish economy none at all it is simply that international factors have become more favourable
2638956 while the international situation is certainly a welcome change from the last eight months it doesnt disguise the fact that all domestic indicators are negative at the minute
2638957 spend as long as it is your own and not the banks or the credit card companys
2638958 the one size fits all approach doesnt fit now with the way the economy has gone to agree even a five per cent increase across the board could lead to a swathe of job losses there is no real point in giving someone a five per cent pay rise if its going to lead to zero pay a month later when their employer folds
2638959 to hell with the doctor this is my body and i should have the say what to do
2638960 but why you dont need to breathe when youre dead the doctor will do what you want him to
2638961 the mask has to be on i cant stand to see him gasping for breath
2638962 but who is this for i want to talk to the doctor
2638963 i called a nurse to talk to her about dad we cant be selfish and keep him here he wants to go we have to let him go
2638964 dear lord god guide us and for help us to ease our fathers suffering god welcome dad into your heavenly home and let your will not our will be done let dad be joined by those who love him who have gone before him and let him into your heavenly choir he so loves to sing base let him be with jesus your son who died for all of us
2638965 dear god please relieve dads pain and suffering let his mother fern whom he missed so dearly after she died at age 37 and his father bryan and in laws wray and carl and all of the others who went before him welcome him into their arms and give him peace
2638966 we had such a fun time just like old times
2638967 i love him so much that i would ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2638968 but it wasnt through running away i was going to cooperate
2638969 you can have my life story for twenty five thousand
2638970 from the drunken stupor of cheap energy over consumption there is an undercurrent an awakening of ecological intelligence natural systems developers nsd and mariposa ecovillage are at the forefront of that awakening creating an army a cadre of peace cooperation and preservation of the earth and its diversity
2638971 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2638972 when you hear the word disabled people immediately think about people who cant walk or talk or do everything that people take for granted
2638973 now i take nothing for granted but i find the real disability is people who cant find joy in life and are bitter
2638974 i have to get it from this guy i know hes working this club down the street you guys can come but well have to make up a story to get you in because its the hottest club in town and you have to be on the list
2638975 you can be disabled enough to be fired but not disabled enough to sue
2638976 what tends to happen in ada cases particularly in the employment arena where most of the problems have occurred is peoples medications will be used against them in considering whether they have a disability that rises to the level of the protections of the ada
2638977 if youre not covered by the ada because your seizures are periodic or they dont occur frequently or are controlled by medication then youre not protected from unfair discrimination
2638978 its very clear that the reason many people are not hired is because of fear and stigma and not because they cant do the job
2638979 we need to do a lot more work to help get people with disabilities into the work force
2638980 we think that was one of the goals of the ada and hopefully we can move forward with that goal
2638981 doing its best to ensure a smooth transition to the obama administration
2638982 that president of course was george w bush his decision to blindly repudiate anything associated with bill clinton is what got us into this mess in the first place lets hope that the next president no matter how much he despises bush will take a careful look at his administrations policies americas interests and the world beyond and do the right thing for the country and its future
2638983 an obsession with terrorism has also made the administration devote too little time and energy to the defining feature of the new world order
2638984 youd be best to stay in safety than to heed their lofty call it is much more than a rockslide or a crevice in the stone that can kill you as you wander or could chill you to the bone
2638985 its the nature of the magic that you all must learn to hear for it takes the form of music in a song you must not fear
2638986 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2638987 we have been appealing to beijing to solve the issue through political dialogue to prevent the situation from deteriorating but they have never taken it seriously
2638988 on the contrary they heightened the suppression beijing should be directly responsible for todays incident
2638989 damn charlie i didnt think youd be able to make it man am i glad youre here
2638990 ive been putting this chic off since i got here
2638991 this is the one in the pictures i showed you
2638992 she organized that party i told you about in chicago
2638993 what you do and dont want to happen tonight so i know what to protect you from you call the shots tonight
2638994 tony i want to feel you cum inside of me
2638995 there is this one the one you wake up to each morning where birds sing and people brew coffee the water is blue and reflects sunshine onto the land around it revealing a crystallized beauty like that of an artists masterwork we smile at this and feel contentment and peace in our guts we hear the laughter of children and the purring of kittens everything is safe and worth keeping safe
2638996 most people are fortunate it is a great fortune after all to live and breathe clean air to feel ease in our hearts this is the world where you and i and my little flagon of sweet jesus juice sit now but there is more as you know or else you wouldnt be sitting here there are secrets denny many secrets
2638997 you speak as if it is all a lie our lives a lie
2638998 i wasnt convinced until tonight but you have the alm
2638999 the alm is a gift or a curse depending on your perspective its very rare in fact ive only seen it in someone once rare indeed
2639000 you see son people live at the behest and mercy of the elements and not the other way around but you whether you realize it or not hold some sway over the natural world or at least there is a connection there subtle but true
2639001 i have seen you sit here countless nights quiet as sod looking into the fountain delving into what nightmares i can only guess about on every single occasion there have been amazing changes in the sky and the air around you you wouldnt have noticed as wrapped in thoughtful oblivion as you were but the very wind changes directions around you the clouds move the sky clears up and at the times when you looked most troubled the thunder rolls in and the rains begin to fall ask yourself have you ever awakened from a reverie and noticed that you were sitting here by yourself soaked to the bone from a summer storm
2639002 that alone was enough to sway me and break my skepticism
2639003 but its not the extent of it when i spoke to the constable and began to hear the street gossip about what youve done as a fireman i knew that you had it in all my years living in this town i have never seen someone so successful at battling the natural pestilence of fire you my friend are singularly responsible for putting out more than twenty fires and yet when i look at you now i can tell you have no idea the significance of those feats nor the awe with which your neighbors view your
2639004 now that i think about it i guess there is a strangeness to my life here like theres an invisible wall that prevents me from living like everyone else
2639005 i still dont know what that means can you tell me more
2639006 im uncle lee come see me this week and well have a drink and a talk
2639007 i dont pretend to know all the answers denny but what i can tell you starts with a girl named lorelei
2639008 remember when i told you id seen one other person with the alm well thats as good a place as any to spin a yarn
2639009 how old are you where you from you know shit like that
2639010 i was born in upstate new york late april of 1851 i do not know the exact date because my birth records were destroyed in the fire that killed my family

2639013 i am magdalena and we are honored to have you here in this place of refuge youve already met my friend clover
2639014 i want to tell you some things now denny but only if you think you can handle it youve been through a lot it seems but i have many answers for you unfortunately time is short as always and much of what i have to say may be difficult for you to accept would you like me to proceed
2639015 our existence is a complex machine denny like all machines there are a number of important parts that compose the whole some of these parts have obvious useful functions while others appear to be mere window dressing lace on a sleeve if you will in some places the parts are only vestigial remnants of a service no longer needed still others are wondrous tempting and of course immensely dangerous
2639016 it is through our natural senses and intuitions that we can detect and appreciate the manifold pieces of this great machine but of all the various components that make up our existence it is a certainty that we will never come to fully understand them all some of us however have special gifts that allow a clearer glimpse beyond
2639017 as youve probably guessed you have such a gift and today i will teach you how to use it

2639055 you see said she hes as tame as he can be as i float him down the nile
2639056 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
2639057 there are so many middle aged people counting on me i would never do anything to let them down
2639058 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2639059 microwaving butter in a plastic cup and almost causing the kitchen to explode
2639060 because it really wasnt their fault that they thought of that
2639061 this year youll find 374 pages that provide ideas inspiration and solutions to everyones home furnishing needs the theme for our 2009 ikea catalog is home is the most important place in the world it will showcase our unique point of view the home is made for living you will find that we are focusing on three main areas of the home the kitchen the bedroom and living room
2639062 were always excited this time of year to show our customers all of our new products at our new lower prices
2639063 we played ourselves into a chance to think about playing in october
2639064 youve got to keep winning youre playing against the team with the best record in the league
2639065 this weekend is more important to us than to them
2639066 i dont know too many people who looked at the zambrano wellemeyer matchup and thought id be the one winning
2639067 these guys are ridiculous at home and they can hit so yeah it was pretty special to win this game
2639068 the consensus when i asked was that one more day would do him better
2639069 indeed the message that the democrat sends is that he is ultimately indifferent to the wars outcome that iraq distracts us from every threat we face and thus must be speedily evacuated regardless of the consequences
2639070 thats what i was doing at the start of the year i kept getting closer and closer
2639071 but when i got back from omaha i looked at the tape and i noticed i was 3 or 4 inches closer to the plate so what was happening was that a lot of balls i figured id hit off the barrel i was actually getting jammed on i was getting jammed all the time
2639072 not really because you can get away with stuff like that in the minors
2639073 i never used to think about it when i was in the minors the margin of error is greater
2639074 but up here pitchers notice everything and they will pitch you differently it really is a game of inches when i back off with my stance i can still reach the outside corner but i hit more balls off the barrel
2639075 what i have noticed in watching him this year is that hes in much better shape physically
2639076 and hes not one of these soft guys from the islands i saw him come charging home and just run over a catcher i mean knocked him out cold shoulder first
2639077 i saw him make three or four diving stops to his left and right he may not have great range but he also can scoop it at first hes making big strides there
2639078 folks need to understand that their sense of urgency and the companys sense of urgency are two different things
2639079 they are receiving so many resumes compared to job opportunities that they are overwhelmed
2639080 what this means to the job searcher is that networking and making meaningful connections is now more important than ever
2639081 it makes it sound like he didnt even have to campaign like he was running unopposed
2639082 i think that term sounds very disparaging regardless of who its applied to ive always thought of a free ride going to someone who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth but here he had an opponent paul showen who could have possibly won
2639083 just say he won and say what the margin was dont make the language flowery because it sounds like bias
2639084 dont worry well find out who was supposed to do it and punish them
2639085 we have gotten better since previous tournaments and we are here to try and show that we can play football and compete with the other countries
2639086 there has been a lot of growth in this team
2639087 we came here to show we are not the disaster some people think we are my girls have changed perceptions a little bit
2639088 i am a bit relieved to finish the game with three points
2639089 we are a young team in womens football but we have talent and now we need to develop our organisation and come back next time even stronger
2639090 the outside projects include an outdoor lake created on top of the roof of the museum pictured visitors can line up to take a little row boat ride in this newly made waterway in the sky with the london eye and houses of parliament in the distance the water seems to flow over the side of the building the floating dock for the odd little boats was made from reclaimed timber and junk store furniture the handles of the oars came from legs of old chairs with brass castors
2639091 a completely buried construction it eludes its volume and its signification in order to camouflage itself in the interstices of a too close residential area a sheet of water by way of a roof constitutes the single facade reflecting le ns sky like an allegory of death all that emerges from the water are mysterious fingers in search of light for prayer
2639092 heres an approach that endeavors to ride the river rather than stem its course
2639093 a set of zero carbon floating buildings has been chosen by riba as the winning design for the visitor center at the new brockholes wetland and woodland nature reserve in preston northern england nicknamed a floating world built on an island of floating pontoons over a former 67 acre gravel pit visitors are reassured with the guarantee of unlimited flood protection the connection they experience with nature is greater through close proximity of the caf shop gallery education areas and meeting rooms to the reeds and wildlife of the surrounding wetland environment
2639094 mit building with walls made entirely of water will go on display at the zaragoza world expo in northern spain the theme of which is water and sustainable development
2639095 symbiotic and multi scalar sf hydro net is an occupiable infrastructure that organizes critical flows of the city hydro net provides an underground arterial traffic network for hydrogen fueled hover cars while simultaneously collecting storing and distributing water and power tapped from existing aquifer and geothermal sources beneath san francisco a new aquaculture zone with ponds of algae and forests of sinuous housing towers reoccupy baylands inundated by rising sea levels
2639096 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2639097 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2639098 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2639099 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2639100 cmon america when i say i wanna kill these kids you know what i mean
2639101 i just say what she told me except i do it in a comedic form
2639102 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2639103 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2639104 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2639105 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2639106 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2639107 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2639108 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2639109 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2639110 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2639111 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2639112 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2639113 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2639114 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2639115 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2639116 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2639117 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2639118 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2639119 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2639120 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2639121 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2639122 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2639123 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2639124 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2639125 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2639126 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2639127 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2639128 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2639129 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2639130 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
2639131 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
2639132 why on earth do they not make daylight savings time the day school starts
2639133 pendel you have done wrong by us why did you wander into the dark tell us what you saw while you were there
2639134 your honor my client is simply very sorry about everything thats happened and the peoples time hes wasted today
2639135 this is nonsense it doesnt matter whether you committed a crime or not mr haight the fact of the matter is that you are a miserable little prick whether you believe it or not and i think it would do you some good to spend some time watching the very specter you fear taking others into the blackness
2639136 i felt in conscience this matter of conscience keeps coming up and i dont know what other word to use if i didnt attend her ordination i would have to stop addressing this issue as i do
2639137 i would have a problem sleeping at night in the future if i didnt put my body where my words are
2639138 we cannot justify discrimination no matter how hard the bishops may try in the end it is wrong it is a sin thats how i see it and thats why i am going to be there saturday
2639139 a un zombie alors quil veux nous manger il sarrete ou pas
2639140 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2639141 there will be more celebrities in denver than there were when the democratic convention was in los angeles eight years ago america understands celebrity and these people will be there to see obama it will help generate the kind of excitement we want to see
2639142 there will be photocalls with some of the bigger names and there are plans being worked out for ben affleck and matt damon to do some sort of gig on the stage
2639143 obama cant avoid hollywood even if he wanted to they have raised so much money for him
2639144 he was getting blasted last week for behaving like a blonde bimbo and what does he do he sends out gwyneth paltrow to do a get out the vote video it was like saying my blonde bimbo is better than yours
2639145 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2639146 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2639147 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2639148 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2639149 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2639150 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2639151 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2639152 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2639153 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2639154 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2639155 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2639156 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2639157 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2639158 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2639159 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2639160 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2639161 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2639162 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2639163 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2639164 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2639165 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2639166 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2639167 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2639168 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2639169 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2639170 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2639171 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2639172 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2639173 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2639174 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2639175 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2639176 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2639177 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2639178 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2639179 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2639180 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2639181 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2639182 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2639183 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2639184 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2639185 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2639186 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2639187 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2639188 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2639189 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2639190 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2639191 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2639192 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2639193 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2639194 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2639195 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2639196 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2639197 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2639198 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2639199 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2639200 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2639201 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2639202 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2639203 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2639204 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2639205 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2639206 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2639207 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2639208 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2639209 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2639210 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2639211 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2639212 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2639213 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2639214 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2639215 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2639216 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2639217 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2639218 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2639219 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2639220 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2639221 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2639222 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2639223 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2639224 just so you all know we did set a record
2639225 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2639226 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2639227 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2639228 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2639229 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2639230 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2639231 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality
2639232 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2639233 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2639234 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2639235 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2639236 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2639237 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2639238 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2639239 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2639240 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2639241 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2639242 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2639243 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2639244 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2639245 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2639246 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2639247 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2639248 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2639249 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2639250 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2639251 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2639252 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2639253 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2639254 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2639255 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2639256 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2639257 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2639258 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2639259 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2639260 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2639261 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2639262 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2639263 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2639264 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2639265 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2639266 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2639267 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2639268 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2639269 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2639270 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2639271 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2639272 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2639273 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2639274 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2639275 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2639276 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2639277 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2639278 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2639279 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2639280 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2639281 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2639282 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2639283 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2639284 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2639285 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2639286 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2639287 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2639288 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2639289 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2639290 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2639291 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2639292 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2639293 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2639294 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2639295 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2639296 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2639297 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2639298 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2639299 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2639300 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2639301 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2639302 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2639303 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2639304 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2639305 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2639306 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2639307 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2639308 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2639309 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2639310 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2639311 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2639312 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2639313 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2639314 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2639315 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2639316 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2639317 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2639318 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2639319 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2639320 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2639321 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2639322 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2639323 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2639324 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2639325 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2639326 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2639327 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2639328 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2639329 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2639330 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2639331 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2639332 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2639333 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2639334 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2639335 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2639336 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2639337 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2639338 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2639339 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2639340 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2639341 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2639342 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2639343 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2639344 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2639345 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2639346 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2639347 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2639348 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2639349 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2639350 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2639351 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2639352 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2639353 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2639354 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2639355 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2639356 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2639357 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2639358 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2639359 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2639360 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2639361 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2639362 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2639363 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2639364 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2639365 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2639366 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2639367 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2639368 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2639369 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2639370 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2639371 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2639372 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2639373 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2639374 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2639375 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2639376 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2639377 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2639378 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2639379 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2639380 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2639381 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2639382 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2639383 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2639384 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2639385 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2639386 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2639387 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2639388 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2639389 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2639390 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2639391 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2639392 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2639393 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2639394 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2639395 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2639396 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2639397 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2639398 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2639399 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2639400 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2639401 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2639402 real results by the end of my first term in office
2639403 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2639404 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2639405 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2639406 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2639407 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2639408 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2639409 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2639410 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2639411 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2639412 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2639413 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2639414 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2639415 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2639416 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2639417 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2639418 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2639419 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2639420 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2639421 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2639422 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2639423 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2639424 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2639425 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2639426 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2639427 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2639428 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2639429 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2639430 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2639431 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2639432 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2639433 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2639434 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2639435 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2639436 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2639437 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2639438 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2639439 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2639440 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2639441 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2639442 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2639443 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2639444 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2639445 i cant go to jail i cant go to jail
2639446 i dont give a fuck just get me some weed and ill be all set and well just leave
2639447 shes going to get out of the cab and im going to wait here therefore one of would still be here incase we run off
2639448 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2639449 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2639450 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2639451 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2639452 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2639453 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2639454 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2639455 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2639456 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2639457 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2639458 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2639459 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2639460 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2639461 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2639462 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2639463 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2639464 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2639465 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2639466 well i m off to the bahamas ty and i have a 6 day vacation and we are going with our good friends jason i call him turtle and amy
2639467 comeback album accelerate in the usa the album has sold just 305 000 units to date
2639468 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2639469 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2639470 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2639471 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2639472 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2639473 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2639474 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2639475 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2639476 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2639477 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2639478 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2639479 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2639480 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2639481 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2639482 we had 5 or 6 customers come in an hour alone
2639483 we were cleaning out the attic and found some things that we wanted to see if we could make money on
2639484 they were taking space in the garage and i had no use for them
2639485 they need the money and know they have something they can get money off of
2639486 we had a person drop off a wedding band set and someone dropped off an engagement ring
2639487 it will be nice to get the check in the mail and not do much to get it
2639488 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2639489 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2639490 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2639491 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2639492 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2639493 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2639494 to subject its spectacle to the civilized code of perfect illusions or to confront in it the awakening of intractable reality
2639495 this is the show that my mom and everyone loves so much what liberal bedtime story bullshit what clich d simplistic tripe i will never care about these annoying smartalecky characters and my god i put the whole series in my netflix queue ive going to give it two more episodes before i give up
2639496 no shes a drama princess after all moms still queen and im not ready to relinquish the throne
2639497 a female who knows who she is what she likes and what she wants she goes after it with flare integrity and wisdom she is brilliant and multifaceted like the finest of jewels she captures your attention in both style and substance no matter what she does she engages you

2639537 only the other day the crooks ripped two boards off a shop and ate fifteen pounds of honey without any bread
2639538 there is no reason to dirty a up a prison with a a man like that
2639539 and then back to yesterdays leftovers when there are some

2639544 but some fishermen saw her right away and pulled her out she was in the hospital for awhile she got better
2639545 blood runs often from her throat she probably caught cold when she tried to drown herself
2639546 if not you can lie on the sack and ill lie on the ground i wont catch cold im too old
2639547 youll get over it she missed you badly and just wasted away from grief thats why for a whole month she just walked up and down the potudan river back and forth along the bank for sixty miles

2639575 screws up his eyes and turns away for when it was light it was more difficult one could see now that his face was crumpled and earthy many people have earthy faces now reverting to adam
2639576 face was a waste overgrown with weeds through the weeds were visible yellow stone teeth and among the stones a lizards instantaneous tail a smile
2639577 only today matters tomorrow makes no sense in a cave centuries will pass before the words tomorrow the day after tomorrow will again assume meaning
2639578 any writer who is not with us the state is against us
2639579 author and autocrat tertzs stalin and the ruse of charisma
2639580 loiterers on the porch of knockemstiffs general store adjourned to the inside when they saw a stranger with a camera
2639581 they probably had said stuff they didnt want to be saying
2639582 knockemstiff had a reputation for being a really rough place
2639583 when i started writing i took that and cranked it up a few amps
2639584 fathers worst nightmare your teenage daughter quits school and runs off with a rock n roll band
2639585 she didnt call very much or stay in contact and i just wished she was back here at home a little more
2639586 it was terrible but i just kept trying somehow to go forward
2639587 and my dad was great to be able to make a mistake and have him stand by me and say try again meant everything that made me determined to meet the challenge
2639588 i got some lessons on letting go and more importantly i learned that my daughter has a pretty good head on her shoulders a good heart and a lot of courage i learned she was a lot more than i gave her credit for way back then
2639589 give us 500 each and send us to a sporting goods store
2639590 awful just awful the person who ran his tour was a horrible person
2639591 standing in line at 7 in the morning with my son at the community action agency its cold outside and were trying to get some assistance with our dpl and vectren bills and then only the first 20 people in line get in and the rest of us get turned away right then youre not sure quite what to do
2639592 we could let it go but i would rather be a hangin on
2639593 she had such a struggle and shes made it beyond my wildest expectations
2639594 i didnt feel driven to finish didnt understand the importance of it or realize the repercussions that would come down the road i just kept thinking oooh rock n roll its gonna be a lot more fun
2639595 but once i had my son i couldnt go on with that kind of life
2639596 right then i promised myself id pay this all forward somehow
2639597 who would ever have thought thered come a time in my life when i read something like this for entertainment
2639598 i remember one time at home i was really stressed out by this project but when i got to school and opened my bag there was one of his matchbox cars stuffed in the back of my book
2639599 for me its not making big money or having a big house i just want to be able to support my son and myself make sure ethan gets a good education look out for my dad and take care of some other people the way people did for me
2639600 i dont know how im going to survive college without someone to do my hair thank you so much for always being willing to fix us all up for formals im so glad you went to a high school dance good luck with the future

2639608 they kept miyabi so she should be fine as well
2639609 launched formal investigations against judges who had spoken critically of the government
2639610 significantly expand ed the authority of security forces to search and detain a suspect
2639611 democracy is like a streetcar when you come to your stop you get off
2639612 erdogan accepts no advice and no criticism hes become a tyrant
2639613 this is the end of the republican period the secular system has failed and we definitely want to change it
2639614 are you aware that you have insulted government leaders many times
2639615 why do you swear so much when you talk on the phone
2639616 providing guidance with his writings to the suspects engaged in a coup effort
2639617 if we had not found that handgun then the police would surely find it today and it would be impossible for us to prove that aygun had nothing to do with the gun
2639618 circles who invited everyone to have respect for the judicial process in the akp closure case raised hell the other day during the ergenekon arrests and made accusations that turkey has become a police state
2639619 but these same groups regarded the closure case as the judiciarys business
2639620 alleged surveillance of senior judges raises questions about politicization of turkish police
2639621 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic
2639622 i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked

2639624 pourquoi tes vous si s rieusement oppos la disparition de la race humaine

2639627 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here
2639628 gaya guymon knows the schools she knows the community she knows the growth challenges that we are facing
2639629 a classroom teacher that knows what goes on in the classroom
2639630 im not afraid to do what needs to be done
2639631 its going to be difficult but it needs to be done
2639632 the main issues are to get more money for the teaching staff so they can do a better job with the kids
2639633 if you have 30 or 35 kids in a classroom its difficult to give them everything you need to
2639634 we need to be proactive in making sure we have clean safe well equipped schools so that our children have a place to learn
2639635 if a kid isnt in the classroom you cant teach it
2639636 if a kid is truant for three days theyre cited and sent to court
2639637 we need to get our house in order and look at how were using our money
2639638 i oppose breaking up the school district at this point
2639639 i dont think we have the financial flexibility to do it we need to focus on streamlining and making our existing system better
2639640 i dont see any savings there in fact i see a big loss there if you look at it youre adding 35 more board members and then youre looking at five more superintendents and maybe 40 more administrators at the upper level per district and some of the areas would be in big trouble because theres not the tax base there for them
2639641 weve already got regions right now now its just a matter of saying ok we need to get rid of this top heavy administration and split it up
2639642 at the very least mesquite and moapa need to have their own trustee
2639643 im not opposed to it as long as private schools are held to the same standards as public schools
2639644 but theres no empty seats in private schools so its really not an issue
2639645 with the school district the way that it is we really dont need to take any money away from it

2639650 s jour on se racontera tout alors c la derniere ligne droite je suis tres heureuse pour toi pour cette nouvelle vie que tu merites tant
2639651 i went to my hotel room and i found a man in there in the bathroom he was going through all of our stuff so i snuck up behind him and pulled him to the ground with my bare hands but he pulled out a knife and stabbed my leg then i pulled his leg in and he fell to the ground i pulled the knife out of my leg and stabbed it in his chest but i know for a fact i didnt stab his heart or his lungs because i took a lot of health classes in highschool and i also took a lot of outside classes about safety and life saving procedures i wanted to be a firefighter but that never worked out but all the memory stayed so i knew where to stab him and it wouldnt do anything but hurt him and make him bleed
2639652 i dont think thats an appropriate question for a job interview
2639653 some little towns started up around here one was called prophets town thats why we have a prophets town state park another one was called harrisonville named for general william henry harrison who brought an army up here to clear for settlement then another town was called battleground city shortly after that then the next thing you know they formed the town of battleground itself and it is now 150 years old
2639654 garden tours have been going on all morning there are 8 residents that have beautiful gardens and theyve opened them up to the public to look at
2639655 a lot of people dont realize the rich history we have in our county and how old some of communities are and it draws attention to battleground its a nice little community and it brings the neighbors together
2639656 we are coming up on a lot of sesquicentennials and even bicentennials down south where the state really began settling especially for our younger people i like them learning a little bit and being reminded of the heritage that we share
2639657 this town of course has special significance in our memory given everything that happened here and so i suppose with the memorabilia im collected with this job it will rank very very high
2639658 being with my friends and grandchildren and seeing everybody enjoy the kids garden
2639659 we expect the death toll to rise because rescue workers have just begun to reach affected areas where communication was very limited
2639660 we have mobilized militiamen and soldiers to rush food aid to people
2639661 by means of trucks loaded with radioactive material against americas biggest city and financial nerve center
2639662 no thats not how it works please dont do that
2639663 lambert has frequently accused ann coulter of using sock puppets as well
2639664 now it is possible that coulter has a fan in ny who has copied her style and has made a hobby of anonymously defending her in the amazon
2639665 carilah hati sendiri dengan segala ketekunan sebab darinya mengalir semua isu kehidupan
2639666 setelah menuai begitu lama sesuatu yang kita tidak tanam mungkin kita telah lupa akan keperluan menanam
2639667 kadang kadang anda berjaya mungkin mencapai gred yang baik tetapi jika anda tidak berusaha setiap hari anda tidak akan benar benar mencapai penguasaan semua mata pelajaran yang anda pelajari atau memperkembangkan minda yang terdidik
2639668 betapa mustahilnya kita berjaya di lading jika hanya berusaha pada saat saat akhir terlupa menanam semasa musim bunga bermain sahaja sepanjang musim panas kemudian bertungkus lumus semasa musim luruh dengan harapan dapat menuai ladang merupakan system semula jadi harga mesti dibayar dalam bentuk usaha dan proses diikuti kita mesti menuai apa yang kita tanam tiada jalan pintas

2639670 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2639671 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2639672 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2639673 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2639674 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2639675 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2639676 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas

2639684 fine ill just go to california to visit my ex girlfriend
2639685 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2639686 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2639687 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2639688 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2639689 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines
2639690 our limitations are usually just by our mind and that our bodies can actually go much farther
2639691 there were no plans for a dvd so we had better see the movie in a theatre
2639692 when it was finally time for us to leave that day we noticed we hadnt run into a sign saying
2639693 theres nothing i hate more than taking a bite of something that looks delectable and scrumptious and then unpleasantly finding that there are onions scattered throughout it in my opinion onions have no place in this world let alone in food who would ever think of butchering a perfectly good meal with that horrible taste and obscure crunching texture
2639694 i cant believe you are all over the internet begging for votes for a contest when you couldnt even stay sober long enough to appear in dana dearmond video she could of made you a star like she did the 1 girl at the end you have been a drunk an fuck up everthing you ever done keep asking for votes with all the different guys you screwed drunk on camwhores you could have been a great porn star dana told ever one how you waited til an hour before you where surpose to be in la then called you always been a screw up an always will just sober up an fly straight you might get something in life quit begging for votes for contest you will never win

2639697 man you were such an ugly little girl what happened
2639698 how in the world are those shots better than shots taken at some movies today with the technological advancements
2639699 the stars are to gaze at after the fact and their actions divine ur projects
2639700 wow thats going to be here before i know it
2639701 dito ko lang na experience yung parang starstruck na may mga nagpapapirma
2639702 wala talaga akong talent in sa pagkanta at pagsayaw acting lang talaga
2639703 lubos lubos talaga ang pasasalamat ko sa kanila kasi kung hindi dahil sa kanila nakatambay lang ako sa bahay ngayon
2639704 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
2639705 when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2639706 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2639707 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2639708 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2639709 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2639710 that was probably the hardest bout ive ever fenced in my career
2639711 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2639712 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2639713 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2639714 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2639715 i turned around and thought i saw 4 31 on the board
2639716 i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31 but when i saw the clock said 4 29 i thought it was amazing
2639717 it was exciting my first medal in athens lane one and now here im excited
2639718 it was a tough race to finish and stephanie finished better it was a great time
2639719 it was definitely a tough race i cant really be mad i was only half a second off my best time
2639720 im really happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2639721 we dont know what is and we cant control it
2639722 if these people are desperate enough to threaten to harm me or my family if i reveal what i know then what i saw must be real
2639723 this is what i was told but of course i have no way of independently verifying the part about government contact with extra
2639724 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
2639725 right now im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
2639726 diplomatic malpractice on a carter esque level that is breathing new life into a failing regime
2639727 as ahmadinejad begins his re election campaign he can say he has successfully brought washington to its knees through blunt defiance murder of us troops and holocaust denial
2639728 despite all of this despite north korean nuclear aid to one of the worlds leading terrorist regimes and despite its subsequent failure to account for its nuclear programs in june the bush administration volunteered to lift sanctions on north korea under the trading with the enemy act and over the objection of our close ally japan decided to remove north korea from the state departments list of state sponsors of terror
2639729 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months and the leaders in washington and even tehran should hope that the attack will be successful enough to cause at least a significant delay in the iranian production schedule if not complete destruction of that countrys nuclear program
2639730 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2639731 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
2639732 timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty
2639733 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2639734 without a sense of confidence im convinced that there is just too much pressure to take
2639735 shia militant groups and afghan warlords to attack american and allied forces
2639736 any threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression
2639737 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
2639738 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
2639739 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2639740 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2639741 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2639742 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2639743 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2639744 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2639745 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2639746 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2639747 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2639748 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2639749 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2639750 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2639751 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2639752 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2639753 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2639754 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2639755 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2639756 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2639757 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2639758 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2639759 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2639760 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2639761 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2639762 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2639763 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2639764 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2639765 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2639766 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2639767 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2639768 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2639769 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2639770 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2639771 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
2639772 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
2639773 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
2639774 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders

2639814 mr costello said a report by global investment bank goldman sachs which found the impact of the us mortgage crisis could be far greater than thought posed risks to australia
2639815 the report suggests investors may need to cut back lending by us2 trillion
2639816 they are saying that this could lead to a downturn in the worlds largest economy
2639817 this is a very very big risk out in the international economy at the moment
2639818 and believe me australia will not be immune it will take a lot of management to get us through this
2639819 i dont usually respond to non aryans but ill make an exception in your case my little jungle bunny piss off
2639820 whats this aboriginal reference all about phil im an aryan with a blood line that makes queen elizabeth look like a mongrel believe me mate had hitler prevailed i would have been the last one into the ovens
2639821 theres no tarbrush in me mate im as white as the queens sagging buttocks
2639822 are you seriously suggesting that kaffirs any black african especially those living in southern africa made australia what it is
2639823 do me a favour shit for brains im 100 aryan not a fucking slavic
2639824 listen you french fool im as white and as aryan as one can get
2639825 let me assure you phil and greater usenet that i am not the product of a mixed race liaison indeed my aryan credentials would make a latter day adolf hitler apoplectic with envy
2639826 im not a slav and i take exception to that slur upon my impeccable aryan
2639827 no siree im 100 aryan whereas technicolour quarter breeds like you would have been the first into the ovens had your mates won
2639828 ive seen blokes like you around sydney late forties balding fat gutted walking hand in hand with some slope who use them as a ticket to get out of the shit hole they live in
2639829 i absolutely refute ever having made such a racist remark except for
2639830 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2639831 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2639832 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2639833 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2639834 they told us at the beginning of training camp this going to be a tough competition
2639835 it just got tougher now we have to compete against four guys not three
2639836 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2639837 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2639838 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2639839 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2639840 i threw some good balls but they made some good defensive plays
2639841 it was a good start and it felt good to be out there playing against someone else
2639842 theyre chankging guard at buckingham palace christopher robin went down with alice
2639843 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2639844 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2639845 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2639846 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2639847 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2639848 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2639849 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2639850 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2639851 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2639852 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2639853 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2639854 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2639855 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2639893 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2639894 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2639895 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving

2639910 karate was new and different but it definitely helped with all the stretching we did
2639911 we stretched for like 30 minutes but its going to help with your hips hamstrings quads and it really helps your balance too
2639912 it wasnt that serious it was mainly used for a stretching technique as we got into the process they showed us a few kicks and punches but it was mostly for the stretching
2639913 i kept wanting to challenge the sensei but he was too afraid of me
2639914 he was definitely afraid he was afraid he was going to break my neck
2639915 it was more gang tackling and getting to the ball
2639916 we started off pretty good but we have a lot to work on
2639917 we have to work on finishing a lot of things when things go wrong we have to play through it and when things go right we have to play through that as well we have to play the whole game through the fourth quarter
2639918 like coach saban says you cant play like a roller coaster all the time up and down up and down
2639919 you do you lose your focus they get a big play you lose your concentration
2639920 complexity simply means this we have many volumes in our library so if a team is trying to attack us through this or this or this specifically then we have components within our packages that are interchangeable and we can mix and match those components to take care of a problem
2639921 ok this component isnt working lets mix and match and change this component the players like that the last thing you want to do is look up and say you have to play better complexity is not to be confused with complicated
2639922 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2639923 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2639924 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2639925 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call

2639937 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2639938 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2639939 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2639940 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2639941 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2639942 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2639943 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2639944 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2639948 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2639949 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2639950 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2639951 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
2639952 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
2639953 there is no better evidence that individual privacy simply does not exist in googles world than by the chilling amount of detailed visual information google now collects on all of us information that any internet user can now compile in a dossier in less than 30 minutes
2639954 hawaii is paradise but folks are having trouble in a paradise too
2639955 her bodys not in great shape she is somebody who helped raise me and shes the last person of the generation ahead of me whos still with us so it means a lot
2639956 i know that the folks here in hawaii are especially hard hit because everything has to come into hawaii and gas prices have gone up the roof fuel prices have gone through the roof and its time that you got some real relief and that means actually starting to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2639957 weve been divided for so long weve been arguing for so long a lot of times about things that arent even worth arguing about and ignoring the things that we should be doing to make the next generation have a better life
2639958 but they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands that the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars to finish the job in afghanistan and start bringing this war in iraq to a close start bringing our troops out and when they come home to treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve no more homeless vets no more begging for disability payments
2639959 were going to fight every inch of the way because change is hard
2639960 youve got vacation you got people on the beach if you were going to take a week off this is probably an intelligent time to do it ill be watching the olympics ill be watching the olympics as much as possible
2639961 its sort of the standard ones ill be interested in seeing how the basketball team does how the baseball team does you know i like it all
2639962 were all caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2639963 the best way to do this sort of regular recurring daily activity is to schedule a specific time for it that is inviolate
2639964 i really only need to tell one of you what is
2639965 that is a very large drive to deliver such a small package
2639966 i should think even a class ii would be uncalled for certainly a class i is sufficient
2639967 you have been paid for a service and all you need to do is to deposit the package at the coordinates on this datastrip use the remote weve given you to activate it and leave
2639968 what is or isnt of our concern is truly our concern and not yours
2639969 but we merely seek to make conversation it is said you earthers like the small talk
2639970 no ishmaeli hirebrand has ever betrayed a contract the only target of convenience for us is you speak another insulting word and i shall strike you as my sister did you will find the combination quite lethal i assure you
2639971 i meant no disrespect i have my own orders as to what i am to instruct you
2639972 we are a secular force you understand youre ishmaeli and have your own duties to your god and probably your own debt to repay on behalf of the muslims it would seem to me to us that you might have some temptation to aim that package at one of the papal towers instead or maybe the godhead itself
2639973 even if we were so dishonorable however could we know if a package such as this is sufficient to such a task
2639974 when you have done such a commendable job of hiding its true nature beneath a false hull
2639975 your package will be in place at the designated time
2639976 if not we have our own packages we can deliver mr standish
2639977 i was diagnosed when i was 13 with photosensitive epilepsy sensitivity to light after having three seizures
2639978 it is triggered by flickering lights tv screens computers etc
2639979 it is like i am having a bit like a day dream but you come back really quickly
2639980 when you come back it is like somebody has switched the light back on i can be talking to somebody and all of a sudden they can be saying something different and i havent got a clue what they have been saying i can be very confused
2639981 i have had near misses crossing roads and i burnt myself ironing at home once so i dont iron any more
2639982 when i was younger someone had to sit with me when i was in the bath now i am older i take a shower
2639983 i dont cook alone there needs to be someone there
2639984 the websites and leaflets i had growing up were very negative about it i found there are ways of doing things not everything was restricted
2639985 i was told i could never swim or travel alone i was told i could never do anything alone
2639986 i do not get a lot of time alone most of my time is spent with people but i have taken up surfing and can do this provided there are people around
2639987 of course there are things that you cant do but there are things you can
2639988 it gives voice to young people with epilepsy and presents their real experiences learning from others in a similar situation can bring so much hope and encouragement and above all young people with epilepsy can see that they are not alone
2639989 there is a lot of information out there but young people find it difficult to find the information about their particular type of epilepsy there is such a range they found it difficult to see what applied to them
2639990 there was also a lack of awareness in the ways it could affect their lives
2639991 epilepsy is a much misunderstood condition which is still often highly stigmatised a diagnosis can have a dramatic impact on every aspect of a persons life
2639992 this site allows young people who are sometimes quite isolated by the condition to gain an insight into how other young people with epilepsy are feeling and how they are dealing with situations in their lives
2639993 this can be enormously helpful in enabling young people to come to terms with having epilepsy helping to make them feel less isolated and more like any other young person
2639994 school performance should not be seen simply as a proxy for intelligence
2639995 doing badly at school is not a cause of schizophrenia but it is a marker for something not being quite right several years prior to diagnosis
2639996 this isnt going to be a way of identifying people at school who are at risk of developing schizophrenia
2639997 but it could be useful when considering someone who is displaying other potential symptoms of impending psychosis
2639998 it is important to recognise that mental illnesses like schizophrenia are not linked to low intelligence the opposite is often true
2639999 there are lots of reasons why young people perform poorly in exams
