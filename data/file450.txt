4500020 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4500021 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4500022 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4500023 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4500024 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4500025 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4500026 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4500027 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4500028 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4500029 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4500030 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4500031 the vision is that of a group of people the council
4500032 no one person can decide what the visions will be and it wont be as likely to change every four years
4500033 also newspapers have never been able to cover community arts in an interesting way things like dance or jazz get really minimal coverage however now with the ease and the different ways that you can deliver information we may discover a new model and improve the way that we cover culture right now we are in between the two models the old one no longer works and the new one hasnt been established heres an example of what im talking about i just spent a week in north carolina with dance critics from around the nation like music dance is hard to write about you are trying to describe things that are not easy to describe what would happen if we tried to describe an event in a new way i broke them into three teams and signed them up with blogger accounts and gave them a flip video camera which has a convenient usb port with which to upload movies to you tube i asked them to use the video to compare dance styles or show what you mean or talk to critics the audience or the choreographer so they had a day and a half to expand the palette on which they are working to find something that is not so linear in form with which to describe this artistic experience
4500034 hey that sounds really interesting i didnt know this kind of music could be worthwhile
4500035 ideally if we had stuck to that agreement i would have been very confident of being able to get the team that would be able to compete favourably with others
4500036 but as it is ive only come in contact with them here in beijing which makes things a little difficult but not impossible luckily we have a lot of talented sprinters so all we have to do now is to work on their baton exchange and a few other areas
4500037 it is not realistic to enact proposals to charge disabled drivers to park in keynsham
4500038 the group intends to keep it free of charge for blue badge holders
4500039 conservative run b amp nes always had to back down on their distasteful and unfair decision to introduce these parking charges for disabled people in keynsham
4500040 keynsham residents were understandably angry that b amp nes did not consult with them in the first place but became furious when the council pretended that it had
4500041 i am very pleased that b amp nes council has listened to our concerns and is in agreement that disabled parking in keynsham should be free
4500042 i like him very much hes a splendid guy a palestinian intellectual a first class choice and i think everybodys pleased

4500055 the reduction we saw in 2007 has now been reversed and 13 families have already experienced tragedy this year in the farming community
4500056 no farming job is more important than the health and safety of farmers and their families and i would strongly urge all concerned including farming organisations and representatives to put health and safety at the top of their priorities

4500066 ive been writing about you but dont worry you come out fine
4500067 remember that costello doesnt like brendan but he hates turnbull
4500068 when has an opposition leader had somebody hacking into him from day one
4500069 he began asking his inner circle questions like how would we beat rudd and what strategy would you use against rudd
4500070 why didnt you speak up and say look even though its not my call we are about to implement the largest recall in the history of the western world unlawfully because we are going to deny the company its statutory requirement to natural justice why didnt you say that
4500071 you werent prepared to recall this product back then but that was the reason you were going to call the other 6000 products back in 2003
4500072 i dont have a particular recollection as to what happened with this product
4500073 but youve just told me that you were concerned that this product was still out in the community
4500074 you didnt take any steps to have it recalled i just find that quite unbelievable
4500075 they didnt carry any avalanche transceivers or probes and they didnt have a shovel each as far as im aware
4500076 travelling in the mountains in winter carrying that should be mandatory they would have been able to dig each other out in an avalanche for us it didnt seem like they had a lot
4500077 they rented a couple of pairs of plastic climbing boots and some harnesses they seemed to have the basics like packs and clothing they were really well set up with that
4500078 over the whole area the avalanche risk is high to extreme
4500079 its a technical climb the easiest way to do it is straight forward in good conditions but theres always the danger of avalanches
4500080 from the top you can see the beach on the west coast so you bear the full brunt of any frontal system that comes through the winds are just huge and there are regular avalanches
4500081 it in fact it held out to the first and second applicants the law society and the sa association of personal injury lawyers that no decision had been made
4500082 the inference is irresistible that in implementing the dps direct payment system in the manner that it has done it endeavoured to thwart any attempt to have the lawfulness of the dps considered by a court before it was implemented
4500083 a court should not permit an organ of state to deprive litigants of access to justice
4500084 the first respondents attitude in this regard is without any foundation and displays a lamentable lack of appreciation of how the practice of law functions

4500086 the ability of whisky to keep its sophisticated and classy image has attracted a far more diverse class of consumers including women

4500093 in the time between mr bracks finalising this report and it being made public today the doha round of trade talks has collapsed
4500094 that changes one of the key assumptions in this report and we think the government should rethink and adopt a phased or staged approach to tariff reductions

4500119 thecall is committed to mobilizing people from all across america to gather together to petition god for his undeserved mercy for our nation in 12 hour solemn assemblies
4500120 in the midst of an entertainment driven society thecall does not seek to entertain but to encounter god unlike other mass gatherings which attract people through the rhythms of loud music the glamour of flashing lights or through the appeal of charismatic personalities thecall is a gathering centered around the affections of a loving god there will be no advertised bands and no promoted speakers as our purpose is not to promote any man or ministry the call is a fast not a festival thecall is a solemn assembly not a conference we believe the hour is late and the times are urgent our nation is in desperate need of revival and it will be only through the corporate body of christ uniting in the place of prayer that we will find any hope in this hour we believe we can see our nation changed as the lord pours out his spirit and brings refreshing to the broken destitute and the weary across our land
4500121 i believe that there are spiritual powers contending for the soul of our nation and that all the false ideologies that affect our nation spring from the powers of darkness

4500144 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4500145 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4500146 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4500158 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future

4500174 the talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4500175 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4500176 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit

4500219 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
4500220 no throwing of perishable items or missiles of any kind at the stage
4500221 you need that word im saying define it however you want and then recognize how useless it is and then find another term to group objects of like properties that are useful to planetary scientists
4500222 the pluto controversy boiled up when eris came up because you couldnt leave things the way they were
4500223 you really had to contort things to say pluto was a planet and eris wasnt things really came to a head
4500224 having a group of graybeards getting together and issuing a formal definition is not a good idea
4500225 a real scientific conference to lay out all the issues and discuss them
4500226 this meeting isnt representative of planetary scientists either there is a very very skewed distribution
4500227 i get the feeling neil tyson is coming over to the right side of the fence
4500228 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation
4500229 everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4500230 but in this case i want to be very clear
4500231 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4500232 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4500233 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me

4500238 eu tenho uma rela o pessoal com o presidente lula que s vezes incomodava alguns parceiros meus de partido e jamais deixei de t la uma rela o de amigo convivi com ele no congresso jamais deixei de ter com ele essa rela o antes dele ser presidente da rep blica antes de eu sequer pensar em ser governador do estado mas jamais deixei de fazer a minhas cr ticas pontuais acho que o governo gasta mal acho que o governo no campo da seguran a p blica poderia estar investindo mais
4500239 ao mesmo tempo eu reconhe o tamb m que por exemplo na rea econ mica o governo tem m rito tem virtudes eu n o acho que porque algu m de outro partido que s tenha defeitos e tampouco acho que por ser do meu partido s tenha virtudes eu acho que a liberdade que tenho com o presidente e a minha responsabilidade como governador de minas gerais me obriga a reconhecer os avan os as boas parcerias que tenho tido com o governo federal com as v rias reas mas tamb m me obriga de forma muito clara a dizer o que penso em rela o aos equ vocos do governo
4500240 eu acho que o governo federal n o assumiu na dimens o que deveria assumir as suas responsabilidades na quest o da seguran a p blica e cito apenas dois exemplos os recursos do fundo penitenci rio e do fundo nacional de seguran a t m sido constantemente contingenciados pelo governo federal eu acho que aquilo que aprovado pelo congresso nacional numa a o ou numa rea de tanta prioridade com a seguran a p blica n o deveria ser sujeito a qualquer tipo de contingenciamento

4500267 whilst it is encouraging that the boundary committee have accepted the arguments in favour of there being 123 councillors for the new authority which were put forward by the implementation executive and supported by five district councils it is disappointing that the timescale does not allow the proposals to be implemented in time for next years elections
4500268 the electoral commission will have to decide when the proposals are brought into effect and that could mean further elections before the end of the normal four year cycle which will not help to establish and embed the structures of the new authority
4500269 i cannot understand the reason for this delay and i am very angry about it cornwall has a new council starting next year and this prevarication by the boundary committee is not at all helpful
4500270 we have worked very hard to design the new council so that it has a strong focus on local communities
4500271 our proposal for 123 councillors is very much aligned with our plans on localism and the community networks i personally feel that there is a risk that the delay in implementing the new electoral divisions will impede the smooth delivery of the new council

4500283 yet a further innovation in the mini segment is the introduction of a volume flow controlled oil pump on the engines driven by a chain the pump delivers only as much oil at any time as is actually required by the engine thus reducing the drive power required by the ancillary units by approximately 160 watt saving approximately 1 25 kw at 6 000 rpm and reducing fuel consumption by roughly 1 per cent
4500284 controlled volume flow for even greater fuel economy on demand oil supply delivers exactly the amount of engine oil required no more and more and no less accordingly the oil pump controlled as a function of volume flow reduces fuel consumption by up to 1 per cent together with the oil water heat exchanger the on demand water pump serves to further reduce fuel consumption and emissions this again saves drive power and warms up the engine more quickly coolant only being circulated when the engine has reached its operating temperature

4500434 political views on same sex couples conflict with this wisdom
4500435 maybe the catholic church are basing this statement on studies other than those found in mainstream research it seems to me that they have some odd ideas from time to time anyway such as not using condoms or birth control i dont take much notice of such statements nor do many people i know

4500437 you have to agree on the basic principles of child rearing and maintaina consistent approach children need boundaries as much as love and they need to know that you are there for them
4500438 it is important that the children know that they are loved that you will always be there for them but also that there are boundaries and expectations of appropriate and acceptable behaviour with consequences if those expectations are not met
4500439 give lots of appropriate praise they require a sense of belonging to a family unit who loves listens to and treasures them to be good role models for your children live as you want them to be it is important for all parents to have similar general goals and expectations for the children and consistency with rules and consequences

4500448 myself and sylvan have a good understanding i know when we get the service we can do some damage weve got pace on the wings which can turn an ok ball into a good ball we just have to concentrate on getting into the box and everything will fall into place
4500449 weve looked full of goals in pre season and weve carried that into the first two games weve got different options we can use and weve got good footballers throughout the team
4500450 we just have to concentrate on scoring goals and keeping clean sheets because the team that scores the most and keeps the most clean sheets will get promoted
4500451 he took a chance on me when i was 18 and gave me an opportunity i went on loan originally from leeds and then he signed me
4500452 you always have to thank the first manager that takes a chance on you because he didnt have to play an 18 year old he took me and billy sharp at 18 going on 19 and played us both and he kept us in week in week out
4500453 he showed faith in us and gambled on us without that we wouldnt have moved on to bigger clubs and bigger prospects
4500454 i respect brian i like him as a person and as a manager i couldnt have asked for anyone better he gave me the odd rollicking as a young lad when i needed straightening out
4500455 he always pushed me because he always knew i could make the step up i think he liked the thought myself and billy would make the club some money
4500456 he added a lot it was just little things every day on the training pitch as the gaffer here does now
4500457 the whole club taught me a way of life no disrespect to scunthorpe but it taught me where i wanted to be and where i didnt want to be
4500458 i loved my time at scunthorpe but i cant say i moved to england at 15 to play in the lower leagues
4500459 hell get the best out of his players and he wont quit
4500460 chris gives us a different option im sure there will be games where hell be used or myself will be used or sylvan will be used in rotation
4500461 it ensures fresh legs and gives the manager different options
4500462 plymouth was a scrappy game and we maybe needed the big lads on to scrap and get the knockdowns
4500463 there will be other games where it will be free flowing football wide open spaces where the game will be more suited to the likes of myself and sylvan running down the channels

4500559 usually we put film in such simple terms while being endlessly involved in talking about our personal experience we admit how complex it is but its as though we never look into a mirror and see what we are so the films i make really are trying to mirror that emotion so we can understand what our impulses are why we do things that get us into trouble when to worry about it when to let them go and maybe we can find something in ourselves that is worthwhile

4500575 im seeing about the same stuff out of brandon that im seeing out of josh
4500576 were not getting as much out of our running backs because were not getting much out of that front right now
4500577 im standing behind those guys and a couple of times i thought there were some good seams to run the football in but a couple of times we ran the ball we might as well had cones up front as offensive linemen
4500578 the problem with the offensive line right now is if you have one guy who isnt pulling his weight it ruins an entire football play
4500579 were somewhat in that direction with the first unit but with the second unit were not even in the ballpark
4500580 the running game as far as the running back the quarterback and the line everything is still building
4500581 weve got two running backs that we know can play
4500582 i do think that our running backs need to be a little bit more aggressive
4500583 there were a couple of times today where i thought they were kind of floating around and not really looking for a way to get north with the football and part of that may have been that they didnt see a lot of push out of the line

4500585 weve got a little flexibility in that we recruited russ nenon as a center

4500656 i have this recollection of somebody asking me for lawyers in new york and i remember naming three or four and he must have been one of them
4500657 it was either her who called or somebody on her behalf
4500658 i remember getting a call from pam and her telling me that she was representing him
4500659 i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4500660 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to the both of them
4500661 we are now operating a school system in america thats more segregated than at any time since the death of martin luther king
4500662 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4500663 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4500664 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4500665 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4500666 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4500667 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4500668 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4500669 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4500670 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4500671 he is a player with experience of winning promotions from this division and played in the premier league last season
4500672 hes well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised actually with the condition he was in
4500673 so for the next three weeks hell go on that rehabilitation and then the final parts of it and into endurance work and serious running before he gets into the football side with us
4500674 the plan is to play in the first game of the season i dont know my involvement because i wont have played pre season but thats the plan
4500675 i dont question that ive always had the desire thats the animal i am i cant question that
4500676 i said some time ago about practice its not a conscious choice any more its something i know that its part of my life and i will do it
4500677 the difficult one will be telling myself to give up certainly not wondering whether now is the time
4500678 maybe someone will have to come in there and decide for me
4500679 my shoulder is really good i dont know when it started feeling bad i think i was getting some pain pre world cup in the six nations 2003
4500680 my neck took control after that and ive not really played since so once i strung some games together there was obviously a problem
4500681 the shoulder problem has been there five years it was quite a long way gone so it was a great idea to get it done
4500682 when i was playing in some games i felt like i had no problem but in others i was waking up really struggling
4500683 it was tough to keep going so when there was an opportunity to get it done in the summer i took it
4500684 there have been some people commenting on the team spirit but its a load of nonsense
4500685 we are focused and with any change of manager there will always be different ideas that he brings to the table
4500686 but everyone is enjoying it everyone has a smile on their face and really looking forward to saturday
4500687 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game
4500688 i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4500689 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4500690 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4500691 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case

4500699 you dont consider yourself spiritual i think of you as pretty much the most spiritual person i know
4500700 i know that many people are or call themselves atheists simply because they are repelled and offended by statements about god made in imaginary and metaphorical terms which they are not able to interpret and comprehend they refuse these concepts of god not because they despise god but perhaps because they demand a notion of him more perfect than they generally find and because ordinary figurative concepts of god could not satisfy them they turn away and think that there are no other
4500701 had discovered that if i said hello to god i could feel god say hello back

4500712 anytime you plateau in training its rarely that the program isnt complex enough usually its because youve strayed from the basics if a beginner does an advanced program that hes not ready for hell stop progressing completely however if the reverse happens and an advanced athlete does a basic program but it challenges him hell still progress albeit slowly so if in doubt get back to the basics heres an overview on the basics of training sure there are effective programs that break some of these rules and im willing to bet that some of your own routines break them but youll say that they work for you regardless these principles should still be at the heart of your training

4500773 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4500774 so im rooted in the christian tradition i believe that there are many paths to the same place and that is a belief that there is a higher power a belief that we are connected as a people

4500781 the group intends to keep it free of charge for blue badge holders
4500782 conservative run b amp nes always had to back down on their distasteful and unfair decision to introduce these parking charges for disabled people in keynsham
4500783 keynsham residents were understandably angry that b amp nes did not consult with them in the first place but became furious when the council pretended that it had
4500784 i am very pleased that b amp nes council has listened to our concerns and is in agreement that disabled parking in keynsham should be free

4500844 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to
4500845 how could somebody do that how could you forget your son inside a truck

4500877 a vote for the war signals irrevocably flawed judgment that it would be too dangerous for someone a heartbeat away from the presidency to possess

4500882 im going now to talk to georgian president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4500883 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4500884 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4500885 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4500886 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4500887 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4500888 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4500889 it is unfair to criticise the gfa for coach rajevacs appointment when his records show that he has achieved great things in his career
4500890 he has coached consistently over the past decade has turned small clubs into big sides and with the necessary support from all of us he will take us places
4500891 serbia is a similar terrain to africa so the unwarranted criticism can only succeed in breaking our front and kill the vision of building a formidable team
4500892 it is imperative that we show him solidarity so that we succeed in all our missions in his reign as the coach of the black stars
4500893 the team is in good spirit and we want to qualify for the 2010 world cup and possibly win the 2010 nations cup under the new coach

4500982 god called me to dedicate my life to young people to go among them and find them because today it is hard for young people to go to church so it has to be the church to go towards them this project was born to attract young people in the places where they normally hang out such as streets and beaches
4500983 i think it is a very good idea people dont go to church as they did before so it is now the church that goes to the people i think it is very original something new im french and im catholic but ive never seen anything like this in my life

4500987 and we all have to do our job getting out our voters and getting our message out i think rep hall will take votes from mrs gilmour but i also think she will take votes from me and now its a three person race
4500988 with three people in this race its going to be a close race
4500989 i welcome any kind of support that people offer me but to be honest with you i plan on running on my own merit im not looking to the state party or the senate pac to fund my campaign or work on my behalf
4500990 whatever they would like to do to support me i mean obviously i would accept and am grateful for but im planning to win on my own efforts
4500991 weve put together a great plan and were starting to get my message out im really excited to be getting to the nuts and bolts of signs and going door to door and those kinds of things that are part of campaigning that i really enjoy
4500992 they knew going in what was going to happen maybe in some respects i was provoked
4500993 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 per cent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4500994 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4500995 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4500996 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4500997 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4500998 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4500999 its no good trying to kid people he just needs a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do
4501000 it would be crazy on our part to try and short cut it because its michael owen we treat him the same as any player
4501001 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4501002 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4501003 hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
4501004 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
4501005 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realize how determined he is
4501006 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night
4501007 but we will see an improvement at the weekend we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time

4501054 our vision has always been that of a non racial democratic south africa which upholds the rights of all who live in our country to remain there as full citizens with equal rights and responsibilities with others for the consumation of this ideal we have laboured unflinchingly we shall continue to labour unflinchingly
4501055 coming back to south africa i have been suprised to discover a generosity of spirit that survived the atrocities of apartheid it is a humanism expressed in the distinctly african notion that people are people through other people this sense of community and sharing is not without the usual frailties but the evidence of its resilence is everywhere in this country and this film has been a tribute to that vibrant quality but tributes are not enough it was the ordinary people of south africa who set the pace of change it was their humanity and their courage that triumphed here proving that fundamental change is possible it will be a tragedy for all of us if their continuing struggle goes unrewarded for its inspiration and lessons are universal
4501056 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
4501057 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4501058 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4501059 president bush is guiding u s relations with russia in a decidedly confrontational direction evoking memories of cold war bitterness
4501060 its a marked turnabout from the sense of his soul epiphany the president had seven years ago when he declared that vladimir putin was a trustworthy partner on the global stage
4501061 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming said janusz bugajski director of a new european democracies project at the center for strategic and international studies in washington
4501062 putin is the only world leader who landed the bush reward trifecta visits to the presidents texas ranch the camp david retreat in marylands catoctin mountains and his parents summer home in maine
4501063 but there was a big problem underlying the basic strategy bushs assumption that a weak debt ridden post soviet russia would seek to become more western and thus would share u s strategic interests bugajski said the president also was distracted by iraq and afghanistan
4501064 russia meanwhile was operating on a very different view becoming ever richer off energy revenues it worked to take advantage of what it sees as a declining america to split the u s from traditional allies such as france and germany and to reassert its global role
4501065 russias military offensive into georgia has jolted the bush administrations relationship with moscow senior officials said thursday forcing a wholesale reassessment of american dealings with russia and jeopardizing talks on everything from halting irans nuclear ambitions to reducing strategic arsenals to cooperation on missiles defenses
4501066 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4501067 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4501068 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4501069 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4501070 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4501074 we can infer from the record that comm davis understood her duties as port commissioner and the legal necessity of voting in public session before potentially obligating the port in any monetary agreement and for purposes of recall intentionally acted outside the scope of these duties by signing an agreement with dinsmore
4501075 i made a personal decision some time ago not to run for re election
4501076 sich mit so einer unterirdischen leistung zu verabschieden ist traurig

4501085 we were deeply touched when we found out they were doing it for this charity we know a few members of the triangle club and someone nominated the charity for this years bike ride
4501086 i am very excited about going on the bike ride i thought id do it for a laugh and im quite interested in bikes anyway abigail is also looking forward to it it is great that she is well enough to do it
4501087 the charity has helped us enormously ever since abigail was first diagnosed
4501088 if we can get 1 000 we will be well pleased
4501089 abigail hasnt had a very nice childhood but when we sat her on a motorbike the smile on her face was amazing
4501090 someone in the club knows the family and we got in touch they didnt want money for themselves just the charity which supported them
4501091 he started having problems buying cannabis and when he did it was poor quality having an engineering background he decided to grow his own
4501092 it started off with a small amount but got out of control he spent three months scared that he would be found out and is sorry for what he had done
4501093 we are talking about someone here who has grown this for his own use there is nothing to suggest he was dealing drugs
4501094 are we going to deal with the serious criminals who are dealing drugs or people like mr day who have a small scale cultivation it is a totally different ball game
4501095 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4501096 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

4501102 but i think this misses the larger point we are not going to turn back the russians what we need to focus on is how we stop this from happening again and ensure that us national interests are protected over the long term

4501106 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4501107 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4501108 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
4501109 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4501110 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4501111 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4501112 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4501113 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4501114 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4501115 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4501116 fisheries in flux how do we ensure our sustainable future
4501117 two key issues affecting fisheries sustainability are the reduction of bycatch the incidental harvest of non target species and the problem of plastic pollution in our marine environment

4501120 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
4501121 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
4501122 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4501123 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4501124 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
4501125 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4501126 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4501127 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4501128 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women

4501140 exalted immeasurably exalted art thou o my beloved above the strivings of any of thy creatures however learned to know thee exalted immensely exalted art thou above every human attempt no matter how searching to describe thee for the highest thought of men however deep their contemplation can never hope to outsoar the limitations imposed upon thy creation nor ascend beyond the state of the contingent world nor break the bounds irrevocably set for it by thee how can then a thing that hath been created by thy will that overruleth the whole of creation a thing that is itself a part of the contingent world have the power to soar into the holy atmosphere of thy knowledge or reach unto the seat of thy transcendent power high immeasurably high art thou above the endeavors of the evanescent creature to soar unto the throne of thine eternity or of the poor and wretched to attain the summit of thine all sufficing glory

4501158 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool
4501159 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
4501160 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
4501161 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4501162 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress
4501163 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4501164 by late this afternoon wed made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping again from some of our distribution centers
4501165 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday
4501166 but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow

4501172 he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun there was a ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppice wood in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees though the earth was cold and wet the sky was clear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful

4501197 most of those surveyed in germany spain france britain and australia think china either has already replaced the u s or will do so in the future
4501198 the perception that china fails to consider the interests of others when making foreign policy decisions is widespread particularly in the u s europe the middle east and among chinas neighbors south korea japan and australia
4501199 is a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world and sometimes in more than one region of the globe at a time
4501200 china is not now a superpower nor is it likely to emerge as one soon
4501201 lots of pretty unattractive policy options considering we dont really want to have war with either russia or china given the fact that were fighting two wars already
4501202 chinas relations with most of its neighbors are pretty good
4501203 the chinese government does all that it can to avoid clashes with the united states
4501204 it china would rather be on the same side of an international issue than at odds with us
4501205 compared to many other countries including our friends and allies china has been much less critical of u s actions in iraq
4501206 although levels of personal satisfaction are lower and by global standards chinese contentment with family income and jobs is not especially high these findings represent a dramatic improvement in national contentment from earlier in the decade when the chinese people were not nearly as positive about the course of their nation and its economy
4501207 broad acceptance among the chinese of their countrys transformation from a socialist to a capitalist society
4501208 for the first time in nearly a century we see leadership in basic research and the economic ability to pursue the benefits of that research to create and market products based on research in more than one place on the planet
4501209 now we have a situation in which technology products are going to be appearing in the marketplace that were not developed or commercialized here we wont have had any involvement with them and may not even know they are coming
4501210 have been dramatic and there is no real sense that any kind of leveling off is occurring
4501211 china has really changed the world economic landscape in technology
4501212 when you take chinas low cost manufacturing and focus on technology then combine them with the increasing emphasis on research and development the result ultimately wont leave much room for other countries
4501213 its like being 40 years old and playing basketball against a competitor whos only 12 years old but is already at your height
4501214 you are a little better right now and have more experience but youre not going to squeeze much more performance out the future clearly doesnt look good for the united states
4501215 these emerging superpowers through the sheer size of their respective populations and coupled with increasing access to education and technology may become contenders for international dominance even before reaching the income per capita levels of the developed nations of today
4501216 chinas behavior during the sars epidemic when it hid what was going on and lied to the international community suggests that it is not ready for that type of leadership
4501217 we saw more openness after the sichuan earthquakes but the fundamental system remains the same
4501218 signal to the rest of the world that china has arrived
4501219 more open more transparent and more tolerant but this will not be achieved overnight it will take time
4501220 but i hope the olympics serve as a wake up call
4501221 china is nowhere close to becoming a world financial center
4501222 dramatic economic growth must continue indefinitely a prospect about which there are grounds for skepticism
4501223 chinas rise further depends critically on the continuation of such economic growth rates and there are reasons to wonder how long the spectacular rates of the past 25 years can continue
4501224 the high proportion of chinas economy occupied by its exports makes it sensitive to the ups and downs of the international economy generally and to the engine of american consumption in particular
4501225 its great to get someone with lees experience and enthusiasm to work with our program

4501230 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you

4501270 today is indias independence day and i have given a gift to the nation in the shape of this victory
4501271 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this for the next time
4501272 i felt like i was moving great getting my punches off but i guess some of the judges thought otherwise
4501273 i felt like i was throwing a lot but i guess they didnt count for a lot
4501274 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this
4501275 the comeback is an amazing thing but he can do anything
4501276 djelkhir who lost handily to williams at last years world championships constantly pressured the slim american keeping williams on his back heel for three rounds
4501277 hes a young boxer and he had surprised me in chicago at the world championships because i didnt know him
4501278 the us and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4501279 to begin to repair its relations with the united states and europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbours
4501280 a contentious relationship between america and russia is not in any countrys interest with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4501281 my dad is the reason why i became olympic champion today
4501282 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can now that im down to the last two races
4501283 im just going to try and rest and recover as much as i can
4501284 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win
4501285 alice is wide wide awake she cant fall asleep unless her room is blue through and through mama does all she can to help but in the end alice sorts out her bedtime troubles in a most celestial way

4501288 i finally made it and finished my task in this olympics i felt a lot of pressure because every match was quite difficult to win
4501289 im so happy that a chinese player will win the gold medal in these olympics
4501290 i was not ready and brave enough to give my all
4501291 this is my first olympics and i thank god for the experience
4501292 she xie performed better and better throughout the match i just couldnt keep up she lost the first game but she adapted a strategy to move the shuttle around the court more and sped up after that
4501293 word came today four lines squeezed on a three by five after months of bracing for the worst i am to read it casually jot down the closing date the trial run is over dr ressler dead his molecule broken up for parts leaving no copies i can neither destroy the note nor keep from rereading it the news is a few days cold ive had a years advance warning but i havent time enough left in my own cells ever to figure it the mechanical music box his body has had its last crack at the staff those four notes four winds four corners of a world perfect for getting lost in are lost in a sample mean
4501294 this is sad for europe sad for all in this densely populated continent
4501295 if we want to have victory we have to come out of financial bondage
4501296 we tell our members dont buy dresses and shoes take trips all on credit
4501297 what we are trying to get over to people is that we have to teach about stewardship the same way we teach about forgiveness
4501298 a lot of pastors agree that we have talked about tithing and we need to talk about the other 90 percent
4501299 i dont know what i would have done if it hadnt been for the church
4501300 i had gone to social services but they said they wouldnt help because i was working
4501301 there has been a huge increase over the past year
4501302 we cant pay peoples mortgages but we can do more with the food bank
4501303 we saw the crisis and decided that we had to do something
4501304 many times people wait too late and they lose their homes
4501305 were going to direct them to places that can help them navigate through the system
4501306 not because of financial hardship just my thirst for gods principles on money
4501307 i had some issues that i needed to get answers to biblically
4501308 i was spending as i was living i had no true direction as to how to spend and how to save
4501309 i know the difference between a need and a want
4501310 i know that its okay to shop at thrift stores and not always buy designers its okay to fix my own breakfast in the morning and not stop at 7 eleven
4501311 it wasnt for me to figure out it was me turning it totally over to god to figure out
4501312 we strongly condemn the manner in which the forest department officials arrested the poor and illiterate man who was not aware of the governments rules and regulations
4501313 they have sent me to the jail how will my daughter survive
4501314 i cannot understand why i was punished for taking good care of a bear that was deserted in the forest and would have died had i not brought her home
4501315 munda was arrested according to the provision of the law meant for protection of wildlife
4501316 he never tortured the animal neither was he using the bear for any commercial purposes therefore we feel he should not have been arrested
4501317 bears are known for the strong bonding they develop with human beings and therefore they are highly attached to their keepers
4501318 we have decided to give him a job in our animal rehabilitation center in bhubaneswar as a caretaker
4501319 we took him over to the world vision experience aids exhibit over at csi where we got to walk through and kind of walk through an idea of what its like to be a child in africa
4501320 more like a partnership formed to run a small mundane and often boring not for profit business and i mean this in a good way
4501321 our expectations have become so high in terms of what we are looking for even the idea of a soulmate is a list of attributes in our head that keeps changing
4501322 i could never really tell the difference between the odd love marriage in the group and the arranged marriage there was no difference and that really bothered me
4501323 we decided we could date or we could just go for it
4501324 it was this idea that commitment is the new ambivalence
4501325 its not so much about who they are dating its about when they are ready to make the commitment
4501326 if they can then look into each others eyes and find each other then i think thats great
4501327 senior authorities and relevant departments have requested higher standards for the environment and order of zhongshan park due to the importance of its location from may 29 no further white collar matchmaking exchange activities shall take place in this park
4501328 this park is very central very convenient and easy to get to by bus and were not doing anything wrong
4501329 if our children are 30 years of age and not married even if everything else is settled a job a house a car then that weighs heavily on a chinese parents heart
4501330 female born feb 8 1977 1 68 metres tall university diploma double bachelor degrees unmarried works with a real estate company engineer a beijinger
4501331 id like her to meet someone of the same academic level someone who is taller than 1 75 metres
4501332 i thought the guys might be suitable but my girl well she didnt think they were good enough
4501333 male born oct 1970 1 85 metres tall double degrees from a famous university now works in management at a beijing university healthy outgoing nature trustworthy good looking and virtuous a beijing householder from an intellectual family
4501334 looking for someone under 32 unmarried between 1 66 and 1 75 metres honest and kind outgoing and easy going good looking and in good shape healthy lighter skinned a traditional girl
4501335 many chinese men tend to think lighter skinned women are more beautiful
4501336 today young women have sacrificed almost everything to achieve their current positions in society they devote far more time and energy to their jobs
4501337 it used to be that if you met someone and you liked each other enough then perhaps youd stay together but thats not the way it is now
4501338 my daughter has been to some organized social activities kind of like dates
4501339 i just work go home then work again now im beginning to consider having a family because im getting up there in years the pressure is on
4501340 china is now free and transparent everyone has the freedom to find their partner
4501341 now people can meet face to face talk about their feelings exchange ideas
4501342 it is the most convenient and fastest way to solve their marriage problems
4501343 the modern matchmaking industry will grow and will not die out as long as human beings exist in this world
4501344 love is no longer the same as before because of the changes in society
4501345 people are more independent they want to think for themselves
4501346 theyre also more independent financially so they have greater and higher requirements
4501347 its a good deed i like helping people to find their mate
4501348 i think im fairly attractive i want to see what options i have
4501349 you check out the potential candidates you talk to their parents you try to arrange for a meeting
4501350 she told me one was too fat the other was too quiet
4501351 the economy has changed the way that people talk about love now money cars homes come first
4501352 i carried hope in my heart that i would find someone suitable
4501353 he is a kind man our life is good now
4501354 it means more choice for people who are vegetarian and more options for people thinking about it
4501355 kfc is sort of taking a bit of leadership on the issue
4501356 weve moved beyond the era of the veggie burger i think
4501357 they knew what to do they knew where to go and they prepared well
4501358 they were watching the weather and monitoring with a weather radio listening for updates
4501359 the spot they were at was the lowest spot of camp it was deemed to be the safest place
4501360 all of a sudden the tornado came and took the building
4501361 it sounded like a giant freight train going right over the top of you
4501362 i just remember looking over at my friend and all of a sudden he just says to me dear god save us
4501363 we knew that we need to place tourniquets on wounds that were bleeding too much we knew we need to apply pressure and gauze we had first aid kits we had everything we knew about this we knew how to do it
4501364 all of a sudden people started taking action like it just clicked one of the staff members took off his shirt and put it right on the guy who was bleeding and told me to get on top of him so he would stop moving so he could apply pressure and gauze we started digging people out of the rubble
4501365 i thought should i call the scout camp and ask if theres severe weather where will they go
4501366 theres always lessons learned from any natural disaster from any tragedy
4501367 we need to focus on the victims the families affected
4501368 this is sad for europe sad for all in this densely populated continent
4501369 i was somewhat hesitant because we are up against a very formidable team and we have young players and i wasnt very sure how we would fare but i think they did us proud
4501370 all the team members played well all three of them contributed to the 3 precious points which brought us into the final
4501371 for the finals we are the underdogs the team has everything to gain and nothing to lose so i think theyll go in with a proper mindset
4501372 everyone faced pressure but we use the pressure to propel us so i could play more freely
4501373 seeing so many supporters cheering us on i was pressured but we did it and were happy
4501374 okay next time just leave instructions on what to do if your daughter gets thrown in jail for drunk driving and ill follow them to a tee you
4501375 es ist nat rlich schade dass wir diese beiden kleinen zwischenf lle heute hatten ich habe auf der suche nach dem limit das vorderrad verloren aber nichts schlimmes die verbesserungen am motor haben sich deutlich bemerkbar gemacht wir hatten mehr leistung und eine bessere fahrbarkeit die neuteile am chassis helfen uns beim einlenken aber es m sste noch mehr gef hl f r die front vermitteln

4501377 das ist nicht unbedingt die art wie ich mir den auftakt nach der sommerpause vorgestellt hatte die maschine hat zwar jetzt viel mehr grip aber ich bekomme sie nicht in die kurven
4501378 leider fehlt die stabilit t und es gibt zu wenig feedback von der maschine beim einlenken daher fehlt mir das selbstvertrauen und das schl gt sich dann in den rundenzeiten nieder
4501379 wir haben unser probleme pr ziser eingekreist und hoffentlich k nnen wir ber nacht eine l sung finden morgen wird das wetter eine wichtige rolle spielen ich muss einfach positiv denken und darauf hoffen dass sich der trend im qualifying mal umkehrt

4501382 one of the advantages is that you are not changing your lifestyle and since you can see right in front of you your payoff date getting closer and the gobs of interest you save it is gratifying and easier to stick to than just making extra payments
4501383 i like the fact that it allows you to pay off your mortgage earlier which allows you to accelerate your retirement saving this program shows my clients how to plan for a comfortable future
4501384 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you

4501389 perhaps appropriate for the last talk of a very long meeting
4501390 the self does not exist in the nature of permanence or in the nature of creation
4501391 it says of the great lord of yogis milarepa that his worst enemies were his uncle and his aunt the uncle passed away early but his aunt also became a student in the end
4501392 oh this person rubs me the wrong way i dont have to talk to him her
4501393 the human mind is not a debating hall it is a gallery of pictures
4501394 i didnt start that by any means but we did make a lot of progress

4501474 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4501475 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4501476 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq

4501492 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4501493 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4501494 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4501495 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4501550 thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates web site who were not facebook members
4501551 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4501552 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4501553 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
4501554 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
4501555 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box

4501600 so get up were getting off this boat you need to get out of your room once in awhile
4501601 how would i youve never worn your um training clothes when you were sparring with me
4501602 well its not like it would have mattered even if i had
4501603 and what if i dont want to go shopping for supplies a fire lord doesnt have to do anything he doesnt want to
4501604 a fire lord isnt stupid enough to disagree with a master waterbender on board a ship
4501605 just supplies no random statues or tsungi horns because i am not doing music night anymore no matter what captain jee suggests
4501606 i dont i cant play at all and i have absolutely no musical talent none whatsoever
4501607 but seriously just supplies this isnt a grand scheme to get me to buy out an entire marketplace
4501608 its a grand scheme to get you out of your room for a few hours you cant ignore the world forever
4501609 fine for a few hours we can all take a break and what are you doing katara
4501610 ill take care of it in a minute let me get ready and then we can go okay
4501611 just thought wed spice things up a little bit today

4501613 now that weve come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself we do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time
4501614 however we see these challenging times as a great opportunity to place more distance between us and the rest of specialty retail
4501615 we believe this gives us a competitive advantage and is critical to our long term success
4501616 wed have room for a bed and dresser thats it
4501617 it was a different approach than the other real estate shows
4501618 you cant get a feel for a house in 20 minutes
4501619 after spending the night they may find out they love it or it could expose the homes warts
4501620 the house had a welcoming feel the first time we saw it
4501621 it was a little stressful being on a tv show and trying to make a decision on a house in real time
4501622 to start programs like free health care for families in need
4501623 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking
4501624 oh wow my political statement of pirating games have finally come to fruition time to start paying for all of my games
4501625 can drills be perfectly duplicated for no cost and no materials
4501626 hi so you want to apply for the graphic designer position well what are your qualifications
4501627 well i know gimp and a whole bunch of other software you guys dont use and probably never heard of
4501628 i paid for it its mine not yours and ill do with it what i wish
4501629 that said no matter what the excuse game pirates are still pieces of no matter what excuse they come up with no matter what justification they provide no matter how many problems they may have had with drm theyre still pieces of mostly annoying little kids who think theyre entitled to everything havent worked a day in their lives and will bitch and moan about there being nothing good out there while simultaneously stealing every piece of entertainment he can get his grubby little fingers on
4501630 mostly annoying little kids who think theyre entitled to everything havent worked a day in their lives
4501631 1 the information wants to free anarchists think copyright shouldnt exist
4501632 piracy is the inevitable consequence of the consumer cost business model being obsolete as it applies to all economically abundant goods
4501633 6 because piracy is easy to do with low risk for getting caught
4501634 meh whatever i guess ill try it because its free
4501635 the problem is that developers have to sell games at price in which they could make a profit which may not necessarily be the price you want
4501636 if you enjoy games like the sims you will love kudos 2 as its a similar theme but done in a totally original way whereas the sims plays like an arcade game kudos 2 gives you time to think carefully about all the decisions your character makes from which people they associate with your friends personalities rub off on you to what tv they watch news is educational but depressing to what food they eat alcohol boosts your confidence but dont drink too much
4501637 games are too expensive the quality of gaming is too uneven
4501638 make games require a constant online connection with a secure database
4501639 i try games and if theyre awesome i buy them
4501640 hey you should pay me 50 to beta test my buggy piece of shovelware game
4501641 oops you didnt buy the super special video card that costs 400 and you have to buy the right one and then you have to take your computer apart and blah blah
4501642 i know what i dont know and what i dont know is why people pirate my games i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
4501643 theres nothing stopping you from downloading a drm free pirate version and buying a real copy of the game to support the developer
4501644 im not removing the original product therefore i am not stealing
4501645 siempre quise ser como los grandes marchistas que ha dado m xico

4501710 the three branches are three days 13 within three days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position and you will put pharaohs cup in his hand just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer 14 but when all goes well with you remember me and show me kindness mention me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison 15 for i was forcibly carried off from the land of the hebrews and even here i have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon
4501711 i had a dream and no one can interpret it but i have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it
4501712 can we find anyone like this man one in whom is the spirit of god
4501713 since god has made all this known to you there is no one so discerning and wise as you 40 you shall be in charge of my palace and all my people are to submit to your orders only with respect to the throne will i be greater than you
4501714 i hereby put you in charge of the whole land of egypt

4501726 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse

4501728 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4501729 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4501730 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4501731 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4501732 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4501733 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4501734 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4501735 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4501736 we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
4501737 you have to be opportunistic when you have a squad like ours i would just like our olympic players back to help us but we will probably have one player in the final the rest can return soon
4501738 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4501739 our fans want a trophy every season they would want the league title the champions league the fa cup and the carling cup in that order

4501741 dedicating merit at the end of any practice is an aspiration that whatever psychological or emotional strength youve gained through practice be passed on to others which is not only a wonderful short compassion practice but also an extremely subtle way of dissolving the distinction between

4501801 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4501802 some studies indicate that some women do experience sadness grief and feelings of loss following an abortion and some may experience clinically significant disorders including depression and anxiety
4501803 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4501804 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4501805 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain

4501832 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4501833 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4501834 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the ltte has also engaged in forced recruitment
4501835 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardise the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives

4501846 yes there are political dynamics we are working to sort them out the government will assume a supporting role and let non government organizations support on the peace efforts spearhead the discussions for the problematic concerns we want to end the conflict that clearly claimed more than 120 000 lives
4501847 theyre telling the justices dont rule on this anymore were going to withdraw the moa ad so that there will be a renegotiation so this will become moot and academic
4501848 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4501849 we further strongly oppose provisions in the moa ad granting the milf through the bangsamoro juridical entity bje exclusive ownership over the bangsamoro homeland and removing this area from the public domain
4501850 it inputs will be collated first it is premature to make an initiative while there is an oral argument in the supreme court we are studying the possibility but we are careful not to get into what the judiciary is doing
4501851 there might be something in the decision of the supreme court that will guide us on how to proceed with legal processes to give life to the intent of the moa ad
4501852 as long as there is openness on both sides and as long as there is goodwill and good faith on both sides

4501867 people used to say about natalie but she doesnt swim fast enough
4501868 certainly theres an aspect of water polo where swimming is important and speed can come into play but its also about understanding the game and positioning
4501869 in water polo in our country i believe we put too much emphasis on the swimming in water polo 60 to 70 of the game is played vertically youre only horizontal or swimming about 30 of the time
4501870 sometimes i joke that im still learning how to swim i used to have like an anchor attached to my leg but im faster now

4501904 but why creating a new legal instrument from scratch when more than 100 other f oss licences exist such as the gpl the bsd or the osl the reason is that in a detailed legal study no existing licence was found to correspond to the requirements of the european commission the licence should have equal legal value in many languages the terminology regarding intellectual property rights had to be conformant with european law requirements to be valid in all member states limitations of liability or warranty had to be precise and not formulated to the extend allowed by the law as in most licences designed with the legal environment of the united states in mind

4501939 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4501940 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
4501941 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
4501942 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
4501943 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
4501944 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth
4501945 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless

4501953 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa
4501954 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4501955 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4501956 if you were 14 and couldnt get a real person

4501967 that we seek efficiency i think the first beneficiary of this action will be the cultural world
4501968 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4501969 theres no indication that any of this was done at the school no indication of anything with any kids at the school
4501970 but we would encourage people to talk to their kids and anyone that suspects anything to come forward with that information
4501971 moreover the choices about how you upgrade will affect a variety of factors including uptime of the existing and new system during the process what functionality you can preserve what system resources you need and even what site names and urls come out the other side

4502006 the theory is that damage to the nerve due to ear infections somehow alters the perception of food so that the person is more likely to enjoy high fat and sweet food and possibly drink more alcoholic beverages

4502018 and he is the proud father of two beautiful daughters adds pastor suzette caldwell
4502019 throughout his entire career sen obama has stood by families caldwell says
4502020 there is a huge information gap that exists today between who barack obama is and who the voting public believes him to be he is not a muslim as you know with all due respect to muslims he is a stout straight up christian and he is very happy and proud about that
4502021 i think its important for us to celebrate the fact that sen
4502022 his marital history has been duly recorded caldwell said of mccain
4502023 many in the christian community have not forgotten what happened with sen mccain marrying his second wife one month after leaving his first wife it has not been forgotten by many in the christian community
4502024 our intention is to issue a positive ad for sen

4502034 hij viel boven op mijn arm met zijn 130 kilo ik voelde meteen dat het niet goed was waarom ik nog ben doorgegaan weet ik niet het zal de adrenaline zijn geweest het was natuurlijk volkomen zinloos
4502035 maar ik ga als een topsporter revalideren in de tussentijd ga ik nadenken over wat ik wil misschien wil ik nu toch wel verder volgend jaar is de wk in eigen land op deze manier kan ik toch geen afscheid nemen met een rus bovenop me
4502036 in onze sport raak je nog wel eens geblesseerd het is een extreme contactsport maar het overkomt mij de laatste tijd wel erg vaak juist voor de spelen was ik helemaal fit in jaren was ik fysiek niet meer zo goed geweest

4502040 if all the information and knowledge scattered all over the world on the web could be organized in an orderly way so that anybody could access it whenever they needed to then the world would undergo a major change

4502044 arranging the worlds information in order to make it possible for people across the world to access it
4502045 even just filming the scenery from the street with camera in hand theres no question that if you tried to shoot the area not covered by street view you would be asked after initial questioning to come to either the ikegami police station or the den en chofu police station

4502052 wow i bet a lot of people dont like it
4502053 if all the information and knowledge scattered all over the world on the web could be organized in an orderly way so that anybody could access it whenever they needed to then the world would undergo a major change
4502054 there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening
4502055 while there are many constants across the globe and being uncomfortable about streetview may well be one of them i would also add that people can arrive to the same conclusion through different paths in this case object to streetview for different reasons
4502056 i just wanted to say that japanese life space is in a different scale especially when compared with american

4502065 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4502066 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us

4502079 die probleme die wir alle auf dieser erde haben wie klimawandel armut massenvernichtungswaffen k nnen wir nur gemeinsam bew ltigen eine voraussetzung daf r ist dass wir eine gemeinsame sprache sprechen beim fragen stellen und ausarbeiten der antworten es ist daher wichtig sich auszutauschen nicht nur innerhalb der politik sondern auch mit den chefs aus der wirtschaft und mit den k nstlern dazu dient der trilog
4502080 jeder wei aus dem alltag um die bedeutung der gemeinsamen sprache und um die wichtigkeit einander zu verstehen hinter der vordergr ndig einfachen frage steht die tiefergehende berlegung wodurch unsere wahrnehmung der wirklichkeit gepr gt wird und wie wir uns trotz dieser unterschiedlichen ausformungen unserer weltvorstellungen ber die konkreten ziele verst ndigen k nnen die wir im interesse des berlebens der menschheit und der w rde jedes einzelnen bewohner des weltdorfes erreichen m ssen
4502081 man kann nicht ber die zukunft sprechen ohne die stimmen der frauen zu h ren sie aufmerksam wahrzunehmen und ihre probleme und anliegen einzubringen daher war es mir ganz besonders wichtig dass die frauen im trilog entsprechend vertreten sind von den 35 teilnehmern sind 22 weiblich das ist eine premiere
4502082 gerade wir frauen haben gelernt dass es sich auszahlt netzwerke zu kn pfen neue verbindungen kreuz und quer ber hierarchien und grenzen hinweg zu schaffen ich kenne alle frauen die hier sind aus meiner alltagsarbeit als au enministerin wir arbeiten beim thema naher osten aber auch in vielen anderen fragen eng zusammen mit der gyptischen first lady suzanne mubarak der pal stinensischen politikerin hanan ashrawi der au enhandelsministerin der vereinigte arabischen emirate sheikha lubna al qasimi und der gypterischen unternehmerin lozsa sawiris sind alleine vier frauen aus dem arabischen raum hier die jede in ihren gesellschaften wirklich einen unterschied gemacht und f r andere wichtiges bewegt haben

4502091 aug 15 2008 8 05 am i thought the idea was to decrease spending not come up with clever new ways to spend the citizens taxes
4502092 we are questioning the process that leads us to this point
4502093 if were being told we must have an intervention team and implement what they say
4502094 then thats a command overriding what the school board might decide
4502095 were not opposed necessarily we just need to be clear
4502096 its going to cost about 250 000 and if we contract with a provider now were going to be footing the bill

4502168 it is i that pities you i pity that you work away a good portion of your life just to own this massive machine which probably does not enhance the quality of your life as much as you think it does
4502169 without any reason we are being held here and they are trying to deport us to the most dangerous country in the world
4502170 we want people to listen to us we want a promise to be treated as human beings we are refusing all food and water and we will keep going we will carry on until our last breath it is better to be dead than to return to iraq
4502171 a group of detainees at campsfield have refused their meals over the past few days the situation is under control and we are discussing with detainees their concerns
4502172 the r ecent military actions in south ossetia forced thousands of people to flee their homes according to various sources over 30 000 south ossetians found temporary refuge in the russian federation
4502173 refugees deprived of their homes and subsistence as there are many of our compatriots amongst them

4502175 the hefty jump in mortgage carrying costs from earlier years
4502176 despite these positive factors the province is expected to face a drop in net migrants between now and the end of 2008 due in part to the increased house prices in alberta and improved labour market conditions in other provinces
4502177 an overhang of active listings in the competing resale market
4502178 single detached starts will reach a 12 year low in 2008 as builders cope with weaker net migration an overhang of unoccupied new units and relentless competition from an over supplied resale market
4502179 the nerve of you people to act so god damn smug
4502180 you know what if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with a disaster to deal with it so shut up
4502181 ive been representing this community for 25 years i know when a person is using me and using the situation for partisan purposes
4502182 the majority of your constituents plan on attending mr disantos meeting
4502183 the majority of my constituents plan on attending my meeting which is the official city meeting
4502184 maria do you think its appropriate to ask residents who have gone through all this to shut up like you just did
4502185 he didnt go through anything a person should not use the death of a firefighter and this communitys tragic losses monetary everything else for partisan purposes yes but i have a history here and i know what im talking about ive been here 25 years
4502186 why would i it makes sense a thousand people fit there
4502187 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4502188 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4502189 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4502190 we have no intention of giving up our homes and our jobs so that others can play games on the graveyards of our people said the rev booker vance of the metropolitan alliance of congregations
4502191 pat mccrory understands the problems facing small business owners and his commitment to solving them resonates with north carolinas entrepreneurs and small family run companies
4502192 as governor i will work to create an environment that helps small businesses grow and prosper by reforming tax policy reducing burdensome government regulations and supporting lawsuit reform
4502193 kesalahan utama dari perusahaan perusahaan yang melakukan tindakan ini adalah mereka melakukan perekrutan melalui pendidikan dan pelatihan kerja padahal undang undang uu ketenagakerjaan nomor 13 tahun 2003 tidak mengatur demikian

4502195 senator obama is focused on opening up the convention his acceptance speech and the democratic process to more people than ever before supporters are responsible for building this movement and for bringing this campaign so far and barack looks forward to sharing this moment with them
4502196 transcends the politics of divisiveness even within his own party

4502198 he represents something above and beyond he has a global view that is unique and his own personal biography has allowed him to see beyond short term goals

4502203 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4502204 at some point each of us is someone elses bad guy
4502205 he drove this cheap datsun pickup with sticky notes posted all over the car like little reminders almost to keep track of the stories he was telling
4502206 and he boasted of having all this stuff i thought he was cheap
4502207 like how he thinks about me often and how he would love to get together again
4502208 it was not handwriting it was block writing it was consistent but weird
4502209 he tried to date all the young girls in san marino and i wondered how he got the trust of our fathers and other men in san marino he was a complete pathological liar
4502210 i said hes creepy dad theres something wrong with him
4502211 he was always nudging either myself or my husband to invest in this or that
4502212 he wanted us to foot the bill for bringing the stones over
4502213 my husband thought it was kind of a cute scheme we kind of chuckled about it because his schemes were so grandiose
4502214 i was under the impression that he didnt even have a place to live
4502215 he wouldnt tell us where he was living hed say he wasnt at liberty to say because after all he was occupying someone elses place
4502216 the only suspicion i had was that he wasnt really wealthy like he said he was
4502217 he would show up to my house sometimes at dinner time hungry
4502218 i saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in recently
4502219 we take formations really really close into the ground at high rates of speed and the crowds always love it
4502220 as soon as we land we drop our parachutes and were in the crowd
4502221 were answering questions about regular navy as well as the naval special warfare community
4502222 ill be jumping out right in front of bill murray at the exact same time
4502223 ill be wearing a digital skull camera on my head as well as a video camera and record all the action and free fall so everyone can see what it looks like
4502224 we enjoyed it its a privilege to be able to come up here

4502228 welcome to our first post on a new blog from microsoft
4502229 e7 is hosted by the two senior engineering managers for the windows 7 product jon devaan and steven sinofsky jon and steven along with members of the engineering team will post comment and participate in this blog
4502230 7 for on tuesday nights this beautiful restaurant attached to the wiltern theater makes good use of its mile long bar by serving up
4502231 by late this afternoon wed made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping again from some of our distribution centers
4502232 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday
4502233 but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4502234 we pride ourselves in delighting you and weve let you down
4502235 to all of you whose shipments have been delayed well be automatically applying a credit to your next billing statement
4502236 or if you are new to netflix and your first shipments have been delayed we recognize that this is not a good way to begin your netflix membership and well automatically extend your free trial
4502237 everyone who should have received a disc but didnt because of our issues will receive a credit which we communicate to them via e mail
4502238 despite flaws a jack of all trades device that consumers business users and enthusiasts all crave check out a list of the best iphone app review sites after the jump
4502239 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4502240 weve lodged documents seeking declarations that he is in fact entitled to be adequately compensated and weve asked that the matter be referred to an associate judge for an audit to be done
4502241 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions its amazing where this series has been shown theres merchandising involved dvds so yes i think it could be millions
4502242 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4502243 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4502244 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4502245 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4502246 when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming

4502249 you can make your images respond to user actions e g changing one or more options when the image is hovered over
4502250 i do not fear computers i fear lack of them
4502251 a computer once beat me at chess but it was no match for me at kick boxing
4502252 computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes
4502253 the computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before
4502254 software is like entropy it is difficult to grasp weighs nothing and obeys the second law of thermodynamics i e it always increases
4502255 software is a gas it expands to fill its container
4502256 all parts should go together without forcing you must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you therefore if you cant get them together again there must be a reason by all means do not use a hammer
4502257 standards are always out of date thats what makes them standards
4502258 its hardware that makes a machine fast its software that makes a fast machine slow
4502259 imagination is more important than knowledge for knowledge is limited whereas imagination embraces the entire world stimulating progress giving birth to evolution
4502260 the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance it is the illusion of knowledge
4502261 the more you know the more you realize you know nothing
4502262 tell me and i forget teach me and i remember involve me and i learn
4502263 real knowledge is to know the extent of ones ignorance
4502264 if people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done
4502265 getting information off the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant
4502266 if you think your users are idiots only idiots will use it
4502267 from a programmers point of view the user is a peripheral that types when you issue a read request
4502268 computers are good at following instructions but not at reading your mind
4502269 there is only one problem with common sense its not very common
4502270 your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning
4502271 let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do
4502272 the best way to get accurate information on usenet is to post something wrong and wait for corrections
4502273 the most likely way for the world to be destroyed most experts agree is by accident thats where we come in were computer professionals we cause accidents
4502274 pessimists were told look at a glass containing 50 air and 50 water and see it as half empty optimists in contrast see it as half full engineers of course understand the glass is twice as big as it needs to be
4502275 in a room full of top software designers if two agree on the same thing thats a majority
4502276 it should be noted that no ethically trained software engineer would ever consent to write a destroybaghdad procedure basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a destroycity procedure to which baghdad could be given as a parameter
4502277 mostly when you see programmers they arent doing anything one of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them very often theyre sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping or just staring into space what the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head
4502278 if you think you are worth what you know you are very wrong your knowledge today does not have much value beyond a couple of years your value is what you can learn and how easily you can adapt to the changes this profession brings so often
4502279 programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute
4502280 commenting your code is like cleaning your bathroom you never want to do it but it really does create a more pleasant experience for you and your guests
4502281 we have to stop optimizing for programmers and start optimizing for users
4502282 its ok to figure out murder mysteries but you shouldnt need to figure out code you should be able to read it
4502283 if we wish to count lines of code we should not regard them as lines produced but as lines spent
4502284 programming can be fun so can cryptography however they should not be combined
4502285 if you automate a mess you get an automated mess
4502286 looking at code you wrote more than two weeks ago is like looking at code you are seeing for the first time
4502287 it is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa
4502288 less than 10 of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the system the rest deals with input output data validation data structure maintenance and other housekeeping
4502289 if you have a procedure with ten parameters you probably missed some
4502290 how rare it is that maintaining someone elses code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating more often maintaining someone elses code is like being thrown headlong into a big pile of slimy smelly garbage
4502291 a program is never less than 90 complete and never more than 95 complete
4502292 when you are stuck in a traffic jam with a porsche all you do is burn more gas in idle scalability is about building wider roads not about building faster cars
4502293 everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization i think we should be just as worried about premature design designing too early what a program should do
4502294 programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight you dont know where youve been you dont know where youre going and you dont know quite where you are
4502295 the best way to predict the future is to implement it
4502296 we need above all to know about changes no one wants or needs to be reminded 16 hours a day that his shoes are on
4502297 on two occasions i have been asked if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
4502298 today most software exists not to solve a problem but to interface with other software
4502299 good specifications will always improve programmer productivity far better than any programming tool or technique
4502300 the difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference between theory and practice
4502301 as a rule software systems do not work well until they have been used and have failed repeatedly in real applications
4502302 if the code and the comments do not match possibly both are incorrect
4502303 i think its a new feature dont tell anyone it was an accident
4502304 if you dont handle exceptions we shut your application down that dramatically increases the reliability of the system
4502305 when debugging novices insert corrective code experts remove defective code
4502306 in a software project team of 10 there are probably 3 people who produce enough defects to make them net negative producers
4502307 i think it is inevitable that people program poorly training will not substantially help matters we have to learn to live with it
4502308 program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence
4502309 manually managing blocks of memory in c is like juggling bars of soap in a prison shower its all fun and games until you forget about one of them
4502310 java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since ms dos
4502311 there are only two things wrong with c the initial concept and the implementation
4502312 it was a joke okay if we thought it would actually be used we wouldnt have written it
4502313 web services are like teenage sex everyone is talking about doing it and those who are actually doing it are doing it badly
4502314 perl the only language that looks the same before and after rsa encryption
4502315 i didnt work hard to make ruby perfect for everyone because you feel differently from me no language can be perfect for everyone i tried to make ruby perfect for me but maybe its not perfect for you the perfect language for guido van rossum is probably python
4502316 xml is not a language in the sense of a programming language any more than sketches on a napkin are a language
4502317 basic is to computer programming as qwerty is to typing
4502318 it has been discovered that c provides a remarkable facility for concealing the trivial details of a program such as where its bugs are
4502319 unix is simple it just takes a genius to understand its simplicity
4502320 some people when confronted with a problem think i know ill use regular expressions now they have two problems
4502321 i think computer viruses should count as life i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive weve created life in our own image
4502322 the only truly secure system is one that is powered off cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead lined room with armed guards
4502323 being able to break security doesnt make you a hacker anymore than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer
4502324 companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls encryption and secure access devices and its money wasted because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain
4502325 if you think technology can solve your security problems then you dont understand the problems and you dont understand the technology
4502326 hoaxes use weaknesses in human behavior to ensure they are replicated and distributed in other words hoaxes prey on the human operating system
4502327 passwords are like underwear you dont let people see it you should change it very often and you shouldnt share it with strangers
4502328 i am not out to destroy microsoft that would be a completely unintended side effect
4502329 yes we have a dress code you have to dress
4502330 in an information economy the most valuable company assets drive themselves home every night if they are not treated well they do not return the next morning
4502331 its better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait for the first available programmer to become productive
4502332 im not one of those who think bill gates is the devil i simply suspect that if microsoft ever met up with the devil it wouldnt need an interpreter
4502333 the problem of viruses is temporary and will be solved in two years
4502334 in 2031 lawyers will be commonly a part of most development teams
4502335 i dont know what the language of the year 2000 will look like but i know it will be called fortran
4502336 in the future computers may weigh no more than 1 5 tonnes
4502337 i see little commercial potential for the internet for at least ten years
4502338 before man reaches the moon mail will be delivered within hours from new york to california to britain to india or australia
4502339 less than 10 of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the system the rest deals with input output data validation data structure maintenance and other housekeeping
4502340 im rather an authority on gods so i identified the god in the ibm pc and it seems to be an old testament god with a lot of rules and no mercy
4502341 the difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference between theory and practice
4502342 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice in practice there is
4502343 the problem of viruses is temporary and will be solved in two years
4502344 now that i have enabled a s3 standby state how can i get my computer to wake up without issues
4502345 because of increasing awareness in the general public about energy conservation the ability to utilize low power states on desktop pcs is incredibly underdocumented and widely unused
4502346 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4502347 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4502348 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4502349 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4502350 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4502351 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4502352 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4502353 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4502354 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4502355 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4502356 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4502374 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4502375 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4502376 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time

4502379 it is unfair to criticise the gfa for coach rajevacs appointment when his records show that he has achieved great things in his career
4502380 he has coached consistently over the past decade has turned small clubs into big sides and with the necessary support from all of us he will take us places
4502381 serbia is a similar terrain to africa so the unwarranted criticism can only succeed in breaking our front and kill the vision of building a formidable team
4502382 it is imperative that we show him solidarity so that we succeed in all our missions in his reign as the coach of the black stars
4502383 the team is in good spirit and we want to qualify for the 2010 world cup and possibly win the 2010 nations cup under the new coach

4502393 we are preparing his defence they dont know what they are getting into they have pushed him into a corner maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
4502394 i think he has made up his mind to resign
4502395 weve said he can have what he wants his house his security i think most likely that he will leave pakistan that will be more safe
4502396 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4502401 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 a threefold increase
4502402 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4502403 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4502404 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4502405 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4502406 in his statement to the house of commons on 22 july the prime minister set out the intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4502407 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4502408 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4502409 and as american general david petraeus stressed in his recent interview with the times the us is fully supportive of the uks current position on iraq and of our proposals for iraqs future
4502410 british troops and their families must be fed up of the series of nods and winks on withdrawal which often turn out to have no substance
4502411 our forces lives are on the line and it is about time that the government gave them some definite decisions rather than vague hopes
4502412 even if this latest hint turns out to be true the timescale seems far too slow our troops should be home from iraq by christmas at the very latest
4502413 the forecast here is for the center to hug the north coast of hispaniola into tomorrow then make the turn northwest then north over the weekend battering the bahamas sideswiping florida and saving its most ominous possibilities for farther north

4502418 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different

4502420 priestgate will remain closed for the rest of the day following a serious fire at the kings hotel but will reopen as normal tomorrow
4502421 buses will be unable to drive up priestgate for the rest of the day and passengers wanting to catch a bus in this area should go to the bus stops outside marks and spencer or the crown street library
4502422 the fire has now been extinguished and officials are working to ensure the building is safe
4502423 today a guy who owns a sport team is somebody who has generated a big pile of money in some other industry and its very likely that their primordial financial interests and instincts are rooted in that other industry
4502424 once the primary season was over the battle ax was buried and we became one team
4502425 i dont think theres any correlation between being a sports owner and supporting john mccain i think theres a correlation between being a businessman and supporting john mccain
4502426 although i have business issues and i have differences with sen obama on some tax issues thats overridden by my commitment to what i believe he will contribute to the overall good of the country
4502427 some nba owners are republicans some nba owners are democrats
4502428 but one thing they have in common is theyre all businessmen
4502429 ill call anybody and everybody the worst they could say is no
4502430 we have a policy that if any season ticket holder runs for president of the united states we are going to support him
4502431 i will drive the northern army far from you to a desolate land
4502432 i will drive the northern army far from you pushing it into a parched and barren land with its front columns going into the eastern sea and those in the rear into the western sea and its stench will go up its smell will rise

4502435 weve both been shunned by most of our family members
4502436 the members of this synagogue on the other hand have been so warm and welcoming thats why getting married in the synagogue is so important to us
4502437 the temple has always been supportive of gay and lesbians some members are still uncomfortable with it but devorah and victoria are well liked by our congregation
4502438 i found the support very endearing because all my life id been rejected and persecuted for being gay

4502441 saper guardare al cielo e a dio vera realt e porte verso un mondo nuovo
4502442 occasione per respirare con la vergine la bellezza della santit
4502443 sollevare lo sguardo verso un cielo fatto non di idee astratte ma di vera realt
4502444 non sono certo i ragionamenti a farci capire questi concetti ma una fede schietta e semplice che pu permettere alluomo di sentire la vita non risucchiata dal passato ma attratta verso il futuro
4502445 guardando al cielo ha proseguito il papa nella sua omelia possiamo vedere la nostra vita di tutti i giorni correre verso la gioia e pienezza della pace non la fine ma il mondo nuovo e il giorno eterno
4502446 vivere e morire il quotidiano tenendoci orientati verso la beatitudine e davanti al triste spettacolo di tanta falsa gioia e angosciata dolore che vediamo oggi nel mondo imparare da maria ad essere testimoni di speranza e consolazione
4502447 maria santissima va sempre collocata nel mistero di cristo e della chiesa

4502449 dal paradiso ha aggiunto benedetto xvi la madonna veglia sui suoi figli specialmente nelle ore difficili della prova
4502450 a tutti auguro ha detto di trascorrere nella gioia questa solenne e popolare festa mariana
4502451 that much anger at the democratic party from the left
4502452 if theres no yelling and no protest signs are we still saying anything yes we are but its not loud and its not angry
4502453 as anarchists we feel the greatest problem with government is how its primary interest is to protect the profits of those in power even when it comes at the expense of the general public
4502454 spending 50 million on weaponry to attack people voicing their opinion and flooding the streets with riot police while schools close down children go without health care and people lose their homes is exactly the problem with the corrupt two party system were opposing this august
4502455 at this point everybodys thinking about the burdens rather than the benefits
4502456 thats a little bit of white noise around the perimeter
4502457 did we ever dream wed have a candidate of this historic magnitude did we ever dream wed have a candidate whod make his acceptance speech in front of 80 000 people and have to turn away another 80 000
4502458 if wed known back then what we know now wed never have done it
4502459 i think we have to give the police the ability to act in certain circumstances where the intent is clear that is to act before something actually happens

4502473 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
4502474 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4502475 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
4502476 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information
4502477 im personally not up to date on the facts so i dont wanna make a stupid choice for our country i want to vote but only when i know exactly whats going on more ppl should think like that paris hilton said yaaaay go vote cause its cool and hott she wasnt even registered
4502478 seriously second of all thank you to the people who support me in my comments against the press they really are stupid and report false news for the mean green i feel bad for you guys they are teaching our young generation how to be catty
4502479 but then you do have to remember this is the same brooke hogan that said hillary clinton shouldnt run for the us presidency as she would be too emotional and crazy thanks to pms and menopause while we wont argue with the sentiment she is clearly talking bum

4502482 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4502483 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4502484 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4502485 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4502486 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4502487 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4502488 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4502489 i got evicted from my house all my shits on the lawn everything ive owned since i was a baby turning grey in the sun

4502493 without any reason we are being held here and they are trying to deport us to the most dangerous country in the world
4502494 we want people to listen to us we want a promise to be treated as human beings we are refusing all food and water and we will keep going we will carry on until our last breath it is better to be dead than to return to iraq
4502495 a group of detainees at campsfield have refused their meals over the past few days the situation is under control and we are discussing with detainees their concerns
4502496 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4502497 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4502498 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4502499 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4502500 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4502501 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4502502 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4502503 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4502504 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4502505 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4502506 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4502507 i have seen some sects of christians view homosexuality as bad as murder and would kill a homosexual

4502511 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4502512 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4502513 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4502514 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4502515 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4502516 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4502517 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4502518 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4502519 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4502520 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4502521 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4502522 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe

4502527 polonia se convierte en un blanco en el objetivo de un ataque de respuesta y tales blancos son los primeros que deben ser exterminados
4502528 el hecho de que esto haya sido firmado en un per odo de una crisis muy dif cil en las relaciones entre rusia y ee uu sobre la situaci n en georgia muestra que por supuesto el sistema de defensa antimisiles ser desarrollado no contra ir n sino contra el potencial estrat gico de rusia

4502535 on page 117 of the california supreme court ruling it exempts pastors stating the following
4502536 r etaining the designation of marriage exclusively for opposite sex couples and providing only a separate and distinct designation for same sex couples may well have the effect of perpetuating a more general premise now emphatically rejected by this state that gay individuals and same sex couples are in some respects second class citizens who may under the law be treated differently from and less favorably than heterosexual individuals or opposite sex couples
4502537 there can be no question but that in recent decades there has been a fundamental and dramatic transformation in this states understanding and legal treatment of gay individuals and gay couples
4502538 california has repudiated past practices and policies that were based on a once common viewpoint that denigrated the general character and morals of gay individuals and at one time even characterized homosexuality as a mental illness rather than as simply one of the numerous variables of our common and diverse humanity this states current policies and conduct regarding homosexuality recognize that gay individuals are entitled to the same legal rights and the same respect and dignity afforded all other individuals and are protected from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation and more specifically recognize that gay individuals are fully capable of entering into the kind of loving and enduring committed relationships that may serve as the foundation of a family and of responsibly caring for and raising children
4502539 this obsessive passion with fitness and bodybuilding is becoming downright maniacal
4502540 not really but you got to do it if you want to stay fit

4502542 with men and women flaunting tanned exercised bodies the fashion is sportswear headbands tank tops jogging shorts and running shoes in offices and at informal dinner parties the high casual look has become acceptable exercise togs appear in the windows of a rodeo drive boutique and at night on sunset strip young prostitutes parade in gym shorts and leg warmers

4502570 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4502571 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4502572 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4502573 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4502574 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4502575 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4502576 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4502577 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4502578 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4502579 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4502588 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
4502589 here i have to reveal a trade secret which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis generally speaking 80 of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media
4502590 in his usual form former un weapons inspector scott ritter told a packed crowd to stop whining about corporate media and become their own intelligence operatives we the people have the same resources and tools that intelligence networks rely heavily on its called google as our own intelligence operatives we cant allow cnn fox nbc and abc to edit and cherry pick information but ask questions and find the answers ourselves

4502606 es la ocasi n para que el pan contin e en el poder el pr ximo sexenio por lo pasional por lo extremista el partido no ha tenido los mejores resultados por eso se deber definir si el pan es una instituci n o una cofrad a encabezada por manuel espino

4502655 aku pernah diboncengkan nabi di atas seekor keledai lalu beliau bersabda kepadaku hai muadz tahukah kamu apa hak allah yang wajib dipenuhi oleh para hamba nya dan hak para hamba yang pasti dipenuhi oleh allah aku menjawab allah dan rasul nya yang lebih mengetahui beliaupun bersabda hak allah yang wajib dipenuhi oleh para hamba nya adalah supaya mereka beribadah kepada nya saja dan tidak menyekutukan sesuatu pun dengan nya sedangkan hak para hamba yang pasti dipenuhi allah adalah bahwa allah tidak akan menyiksa orang yang tidak berbuat syirik sedikitpun kepada nya aku bertanya ya rasulullah tidak perlukah aku menyampaikan kabar gembira ini kepada orang orang beliau menjawab janganlah kamu menyampaikan kabar gembira ini kepada mereka karena bisa membuat mereka berpangku tangan
4502656 inilah janji allah azza wa jalla dan sesungguhnya janji allah adalah haq benar adapun makna bahwa allah tidak mengadzab orang yang tidak menyekutukannya adalah bahwa dosa dosa dapat diampuni karena adanya tauhid tidak menyembah allah sementara ia sendiri tidak menyekutukannya akan diadzab

4502677 regain records has once again been found in violation of copyrights and agreements made with gaahl and king bass and is ordered to cease distribution of this release
4502678 i am writing to inform you about the fact that there has been taken a decision to split up the band infernus on one side gaahl and king on the other we cannot continue working together any longer what is still not agreed upon is who rightfully gets to keep the bands name since this will be a question of legal affairs i am afraid this might take time to get sorted out i am sorry for that
4502679 recognizes infernus as the rightful owner of the bands name logo and trademark and is prepared to take any legal steps necessary to prevent any third party from exploiting it artistically and commercially
4502680 it is a matter of principles for us infernus started the band and has been the spine of gorgoroth since 1992
4502681 also looking on the contractual side of things we have an agreement signed with gorgoroth and it is signed solely by infernus the other part of gorgoroth has given infernus a written power of attorney to negotiate and close deals on their behalf
4502682 neither i nor gaahl is thinking about it at all at this point
4502683 its over its all over the only thing he has left is to use the name to create some kind of confusion but for the record label everything is gone we own the trademark they cant use it infernus cant use it

4502698 if it comes down to attending a committee hearing or taking the time to put the notice up on the web site then obviously im going to do the hearing its a little tricky because the site is paid for with my campaign money but i dont see any reason why i cant use it for constituent outreach and constituent services theres nothing that says i cant do it any campaign money you can use for a valid purpose related to serving or campaigning and i certainly think maintaining this website is a valid purpose i think itll help people a lot a lot more than the typical legislative website

4502713 in one of their hyms the sect pictures itself as a pregant woman suffering the pangs of parturition as she gives birth to her firstborn who is described in terms reminiscent of the child of isaish 9 6 the wonderful counsellor most scholars agree that the passage retains its biblical messianic significance in which case it appears that the sect believed that out of its suffering of atonement for the land would come the anointed one or christ
4502714 in spite of that the general lines of the text are clear enough to assure us that in qumran interpretation jacobs blessing of judah was seen as a promise of the restoration of the davidic monarchy and of the perpetuity of his royal office
4502715 it is an aramaic text one of the copies of the testament of levi recently published by e
4502716 and he will atone for all the children of his generation
4502717 they will utter many words against him and an abundance of lies they will fabricate fables against him and utter every kind of disparagement against him
4502718 our qumran text 4q521 is astonishingly quite close to this christian concept of the messiah
4502719 there is no doubt that the qumran community had faith in the ultimate victory of such a messiah over all evil however a closer reading of these texts reveals an additional theme equally dominant that of an initial though temporary triumph of wicked over righteousness that is there was the belief among the qumran community that the messiah would suffer initial defeat but that he would ultimately triumph in the end of days

4502724 the mishna is the authorized codification of the oral or unwritten law which on the basis of the written law contained in pentateuch developed during the second temple and down to the end of the second century of the common era
4502725 o jesus of nazerath is who we are talking about
4502726 let us imagine what a jew let alone a philosopher might say to jesus is it not true good sir that you fabricated the story of your birth from a virgin to quiet rumourss about the true and insavoury circumstances of your origins is it not the case that far from being born in the royal davids city of bethlehem you were born in a poor country town and of a woman who earned her living by spinning is it not the case that when her deceit was uncovered to wit that she was pregnant by a roman soldier called panthera she was driven away by her husband the carpenter and convicted of adultery
4502727 i could continue along these lines suggesting a good deal about the affairs of jesus life that does not appear in your own records indeed what i know to be the case and what the disciples tell are two very different stories for example the nonsensical idea that jesus foresaw everything that was to happen to him an obvious attempt to conceal the humiliating facts
4502728 is used for jesus in the ammoraic period i e fifth century period

4502792 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4502793 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4502803 the continuing improvement in profitability is attributable to the higher prices which vestas initiated in 2005 and the ongoing enhancement of operational efficiency

4502854 the last thing we need today is more mean spirited heresy hunters blasting other christians
4502855 today christianity seems as if it is a religion of anything goes the ancients landmarks have been removed and today it appears there are no boundaries to what is christian in idea thought conduct etc everyone is being led by the spirit to propound and propagate ideas and practices that have no precedent in the holy scriptures
4502856 if you see a little child climbing his way up a tall tree know that there is an adult on ground aiding and pushing the childs way buttocks up the tree
4502857 dont let any man cheat you of your joy in christ by persuading you to make yourselves humble and fall down and worship angels
4502858 they are ministering spirits sent forth to minister for the saints
4502859 to reach them the lost you gotta be like them
4502860 a text taken out of context quickly becomes a pretext
4502861 wherever we are the right thing must be insist on and the right thing we must do be it on dressing prayer legislation etc we must insist on the right thing
4502862 now the bereans were of more noble character than the thessalonians for they received the message with great eagerness
4502863 if all christians were to examine carefully what they read in books or hear even from the pulpit and check it against the infallible scriptures then error would have little freedom and space to circulate we would do well to examine everything we hear for the truthfulness of its content and not allow ourselves to be taken in by the attractiveness of its packaging
4502864 we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitfully scheming
4502865 relentlessly hunted down a doctor who would perform the irreversible surgery
4502866 having children is selfish its all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet
4502867 every person who is born uses more food more water more land more fossil fuels more trees and produces more rubbish more pollution more greenhouse gases and adds to the problem of over population
4502868 when i finished school i got a job in retail and at 19 i met my first husband
4502869 no sooner had we finished our wedding cake than all our relatives started to ask when they could expect a new addition to the family
4502870 i always told them that would never happen but no one listened
4502871 when i was a child i loved bird watching and in my teens that developed into a passion for the environment as well as the welfare of animals i became a vegetarian when i was 15
4502872 even my parents used to smile and say youll change your mind one day about babies
4502873 the only person who understood how i felt was my first husband who didnt want children either
4502874 we both passionately wanted to save the planet not produce a new life which would only add to the problem
4502875 when i was 21 i considered sterilisation for the first time
4502876 id been on the pill for five years and didnt want to take hormone based contraception indefinitely
4502877 i went to my gp but she wouldnt even consider the idea
4502878 she said i was far too young and told me i could absolutely not be sterilised and that i was bound to change my mind one day
4502879 we decided my husband would have a vasectomy instead he was 25 just a few years older than me but the gp allowed him to go ahead
4502880 i found it insulting that she thought that just because i was a woman id reach a point where an urge to breed would overcome all rational thought
4502881 through my job i made many friends who like me were more interested in campaigning trying to change society and save the planet rather than having families of our own
4502882 we used to say that if ever we did want children wed adopt as there are so many children in need of a loving family
4502883 at least then wed be doing something positive for the world rather than something negative
4502884 i discovered that despite taking the pill id accidentally fallen pregnant by my boyfriend
4502885 i was horrified i knew straight away there was no option of having the baby
4502886 i went to my doctor about having a termination and asked if i could be sterilised at the same time
4502887 this time it was a male doctor i remember saying to him i want to make sure this never happens again
4502888 he said you may not want a child but one day you may meet a man who does he refused to consider it
4502889 i didnt like having a termination but it would have been immoral to give birth to a child that i felt strongly would only be a burden to the world
4502890 ive never felt a twinge of guilt about what i did and have honestly never wondered what might have been
4502891 after my abortion i was more determined than ever to pursue sterilisation
4502892 by then i had my mothers support she realised i wasnt going to grow out of my beliefs and was proud of my campaigning work
4502893 my new gp was more forward thinking and referred me to hospital i couldnt wait for the operation
4502894 a week before my sterilisation i went to an animal rights demonstration and met ed
4502895 i liked him immediately and i told him what i was doing straight away because if he wanted children then he needed to know i wasnt the woman for him
4502896 but ed was relieved when i told him how i felt and said he didnt want children for the same reasons
4502897 after the operation which is irreversible i didnt feel emotional just relieved
4502898 ive never doubted that i made the right decision ed and i married in september 2002 and have a much nicer lifestyle as a result of not having children
4502899 we love walking and hiking and we often go away for weekends
4502900 every year we also take a nice holiday weve just come back from south africa
4502901 we feel we can have one long haul flight a year as we are vegan and childless thereby greatly reducing our carbon footprint and combating over population
4502902 my only frustration is that other people are unable to accept my decision
4502903 when i tell people why i dont want children they look at me as if i was planning to commit murder
4502904 a woman who does not have maternal feelings is seen as some sort of anomaly
4502905 and a woman like me who is not having children in order to save the planet is considered barking mad
4502906 what i consider mad are those women who ferry their children short distances in gas guzzling cars
4502907 i realised then that a baby would pollute the planet and that never having a child was the most environmentally friendly thing i could do
4502908 ive had boyfriends who wanted children so i knew i couldnt be with them long term says sarah
4502909 ive had to break up with a couple of boyfriends because i didnt think it was fair to waste their time
4502910 in my early 20s i had a boyfriend who i really liked but he wanted to start a family as soon as possible
4502911 i was tempted to stay with him and hope he would change his mind but i knew i couldnt provide him with what he wanted so i walked away
4502912 to my relief mark was as adamant as me that he didnt want a family after a year of dating we started talking about sterilisation
4502913 i didnt want to have an accident if contraception didnt work we would be faced with the dilemma of whether to keep the baby
4502914 we realised it was a much more straightforward procedure safer and easier for a man to be sterilised through a vasectomy than a woman to be sterilised
4502915 in january 2005 mark had a vasectomy and we both felt incredibly relieved there was no chance of us having a baby
4502916 we both have nieces who we love dearly and i consider myself a caring nurturing person
4502917 my sister recently had a little girl and that has taken the pressure off me because my parents wanted to be grandparents
4502918 at first they were surprised by my decision but they have never criticised us
4502919 id never dream of preaching to others about having a family its a very personal choice what i do like to do is make people aware of the facts
4502920 when i see a mother with a large family i dont resent her but i do hope shes thought through the implications
4502921 sarah and i live as green a life a possible we dont have a car cycle everywhere instead and we never fly
4502922 we recycle use low energy light bulbs and eat only organic locally produced food
4502923 in short we do everything we can to reduce our carbon footprint but all this would be undone if we had a child
4502924 the last thing we need today is more mean spirited heresy hunters blasting other christians
4502925 today christianity seems as if it is a religion of anything goes the ancients landmarks have been removed and today it appears there are no boundaries to what is christian in idea thought conduct etc everyone is being led by the spirit to propound and propagate ideas and practices that have no precedent in the holy scriptures

4502937 anytime you are doing something out of the ordinary you have to be extra vigilant put your purse cell phone or wallet in the back with the baby

4503043 speak to eas marketing and publishing strengths but doesnt say much for their development talent
4503044 concerned to see how much top line growth is coming from low margin distribution deals out of ea partners
4503045 ea partners agreements generate two things for ea sales so it helps the top line and cash but the deals are low margin
4503046 ea is trying to get its margins up to 20 25 percent and these deals negatively impact that
4503047 these agreements make ea look more like a distributor than a developer of world class videogame titles
4503048 if they had their own properties say like what activision has they wouldnt need these distribution deals in the past they havent but for some reason now theres a big push

4503051 maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves american citizens will find the back bone to start speaking and voicing the same truths
4503052 we respect the right of individuals and groups to express their views and believes however we expect elected officials to represent their entire constituency completely and fairly without bias or discrimination
4503053 we promote interfaith dialogue and harmony we understand that dialogue is the only way to reduce fear and suspicion between communities and the only way to increase respect understanding and cooperation between them
4503054 when there is a person in need it is the muslims who stand up to help i hold them to be some of the dearest friends i have
4503055 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity
4503056 the meeting was set up to be a positive non confrontational event
4503057 it was a expression of religious tolerance interfaith co operation highlighting the practice of religious freedom for american citizens good citizenship of practicing american muslims

4503062 dr lee were you the medical officer who attended him
4503063 in fact he personally contacted our director general health ministry dg tan sri dr ismail merican regarding this and dg just called me this morning
4503064 omg is it something good or bad i see may i know is there any issue with this
4503065 of course theres an issue if not i wont purposely come down and see you right
4503066 he wants to say congratulations to you datos very satisfied with the management here he said thank you and hes impressed with the efficiency here
4503067 hey lee well done i think you just stay in the department la forget about medical
4503068 do you prefer the brushed nickel finish to the unlacquered brass
4503069 well brushed nickel might better complement the zinc top on the island unlacquered brass is more authentic to the period of our house
4503070 i dont know i havent asked her yet i wanted to hear your preference first
4503071 julie says to sample the farrow amp ball shaded white and to see if we like it paired with the slipper satin
4503072 you say that as if im being unpatriotic at least its from england not from france
4503073 i can color match it in benjamin moore it will be half the price it will be the same thing
4503074 julie says the pigments arent the same it wont have the same depth of color and richard the architect agrees everyone knows you cant color match farrow amp ball
4503075 julie says this one is a warm white not a white white not too white this one here is a bit brighter with a touch more green in it not a bright white just brighter which one do you prefer
4503076 really i think i like the brighter one a little more
4503077 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4503078 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4503079 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4503080 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4503081 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4503082 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4503083 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4503084 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4503085 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4503090 we have made our navigation system run on the iphone it looks good and works very well
4503091 we will have to look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us
4503092 to the contrary it makes me happy that im getting this much attention but now her withdrawal leaves japan with just two entrants in the womens olympic marathon more
4503093 this is what ive dreamed of being considered one of the best in the world
4503094 if shalane stays shalane and stays simple shes going to be great i think shell become americas best distance runner ever and she may already be

4503097 the heat makes it very painful but i like that it gives you an opportunity to look at strategy and if you prepare properly then it can play into your hands
4503098 the ethiopian officials dont allow me to train in ethiopia any longer
4503099 i train now at high altitudes in turkey as i think that some of my former compatriots see me as a threat
4503100 i will try to put my heart and soul into trying to beat her when im on the starting line but she is the pre race favorite because she is the world record holder by a substantial margin coming into this race
4503101 you keep an eye on all competition and you also know that the chinese women are going to put on a great show because of the pride theyre going to have representing the home country as well as the three returning medalists from athens
4503102 theyre really down on my case i got pretty upset two days ago because since i have been here they have tested me four times
4503103 theyve taken so much blood from us were going to be very weak before the 100 meter final
4503104 i have always had the goods to deliver but have had some problems delivering its the one with the level head who will win the race
4503105 the race of the games quite possibly of any games
4503106 we have entered a new era of mens sprinting spearheaded by a super elite who have broken away from the rest and are taking the sport to unimaginable heights
4503107 the first and second rounds will reveal whether he is still carrying the injury and gay knows more than anyone that he needs to send out an early message to his rivals to win the 100 meters it is important to make your presence felt by dominating from the start
4503108 ill always look for robles with the times hes run this year as consistent as hes been as fluent as hes been
4503109 his leg speed is incredible he maintains it very well and how much more leg speed he can gain is a question but id say not much
4503110 this is obviously not the mountain air of home but i also have the feeling that the air quality here is much better than it was during my last stay in february im not suffering
4503111 it was really my win at the tokyo marathon in february that showed me what i was truly capable of i dont think i now have to be scared of anyone or believe anyone is better than me in beijing
4503112 phelps has got the most career gold medals and barring an act of god hes going to surpass mark spitzs record of seven golds at a single games
4503113 hes hungry for more gold good phelps crave gold make phelps strong
4503114 also phelps is now referring to himself in the third person
4503115 showing that middle aged members of a runners club were half as likely to die over a 20 year period as people who did not run
4503116 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
4503117 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
4503118 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
4503119 sedentary muffin crumb laden remote control clutching parking lot circling drive through using gym avoiding running is bad for your knees insisting
4503120 i just didnt realize i could accomplish them until this last year
4503121 she knew she was going to be good at something
4503122 in elementary school she said she was going to be a best selling author and support us in old age as time went on and she began to excel in running that became most of her dream
4503123 ive always wanted to push myself to the limit so i dont think looking for a medal is out of the question
4503124 made her mind up early that she was going to see how far this running game could take her and she was willing to spend the time to train bear the pain and keep her eye on the prize
4503125 i felt a little sluggish in the first round but my bodys woke up now
4503126 i laid my hands on him and said in his ear its going to be o
4503127 its just like when theyre two years old and they fall down and skin their knees you just want to fix it
4503128 its weird a little bit because she doesnt know that much about track but she understands how to keep me calm
4503129 a lot of people think thats strange and like to be by themselves but i like being around my family at track meets i feel comfortable just like being at home
4503130 have potential holes in their game tyson gay is coming off a hamstring injury and the 100 final comes exactly six weeks after he went down in the u s olympic trials usain bolt has never run the 100 meters at a global championship asafa powell has been a head case
4503131 you learn by practice you smash a lot of stuff the first month or so
4503132 engage in life life is worth living to the fullest from the soccer mom who thinks she cant be out there watching her kids play soccer because of the pollen to kids who have asthma
4503133 it made me think i had to work harder to get back to where i was since then ive been working harder staying focused and correcting what i did wrong
4503134 i think about his legacy he doesnt jeremy is not making a lot of noise hes won everything there is to win in the last few years and hes young hes only 24
4503135 when im in the united states it takes like five minutes to recover after a workout but here i need eight or nine minutes to recover because the air is so thick
4503136 last week we didnt have a track and we didnt have a field but now everything is in place
4503137 has the potential to be one of the best 100 meters that we have ever seen at the olympics
4503138 at this point bolt is the favorite powell has proved that its very difficult for him to get it done on the days when it counts
4503139 was in the best shape of his life and was in a completely different zone
4503140 inspired by the stories associated with our extended family one of the reasons i have such a great love for sports is the amazing narratives that accompany elite performers in athletic competition
4503141 a young man so full of energy and love of life that he leaves everyone he meets smiling
4503142 its a lot of time and a lot of space and a lot of things coming together lauryn williams says of the art of the baton pass
4503143 the more you practice and the more you become in tune with your teammates the better chemistry you develop and the less likely it is that things will happen
4503144 if i do get my last 20 meters good i know that ill medal in the 100 meters
4503145 after that then ill look to the 200m but definitely for both events im really looking forward to score medals
4503146 first i was going to camp there and the next thing i knew we were living in the basement
4503147 ive got a very understanding wife first of all and ive got a very supportive family secondly
4503148 its who i am its where i was raised its where my family is its where i identify myself with its everything its hard to explain to people unless youre from hawaii its really hard to explain to people what hawaii means to you because you have to come and experience it
4503149 i cant believe it will be long before such a time is run
4503150 what disappointed me most of all in osaka was that if blonska had been given the kind of ban she should have been then wed have had two brits on the podium
4503151 it was my first year at the trials and i got some great experience i think ill be more prepared next time and hopefully i can run my own race and not get distracted by some of the other stuff i think its given me more focus and they say that female athletes peak in their late 20s so hopefully ill be peaking by then
4503152 wed always ask her mildred what are you doing today
4503153 the continued lack of consumer confidence as a result of the global economic downturn sharp increases in raw material costs inflationary pressures poor spring weather and the continued impact of the lack of snow in 2006 has resulted in tough trading conditions
4503154 our order book for winter sports 08 09 is now complete and as anticipate we have only recovered about half of the sales lost 2007
4503155 overall we anticipate tough trading conditions for the remainder of 2008 and we continue to anticipate that we will record an operating loss for 2008
4503156 if i may be so bold there was another president
4503157 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4503158 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4503159 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to
4503160 how could somebody do that how could you forget your son inside a truck
4503161 plastic hose reels are both safer and lighter than the wooden reels they replace
4503162 many localities will not accept wooden reels for recycling in addition they splinter easily and the metal banding used to secure the hose on them can present a safety hazard if handled improperly
4503163 basically i think a lot of people must be wondering how they managed to get through sxswi before twitter came along its like trying to imagine the days when there was no email

4503186 unfortunately babayaro is not what i need so there wont be anything going there i am not sure about jordi at the moment though weve had him here this week and you can see hes a decent player
4503187 hes played for real madrid so you must have something about you and by all accounts he did okay at gosport the other night the lads a good player though well take it from there really
4503188 we are busy having a look at denge as he has been training with us but at this stage we havent signed him as yet that is where it stands at this moment
4503189 i dont know why wits decided to release a player of denges qualities i mean the boy has everything you need in a player the physical presence discipline and skill though he hasnt been signed yet he has done really well since he arriving here
4503190 it is a pity that i am not there i could have talked sense into this guy you know that i am the closest person to the goalkeepers there in china and i know how i have been cutting of the excesses of uanzekin in our previous games
4503191 it is a pity that i was sent packing from beijing but i wont comment on that
4503192 there is no way my absence wont be felt in china because other coaches samson siasia and henry nwosu have so many problems to contend with like the defense attack midfield and even technical and tactical aspect of the game
4503193 we have sent felixs papers to the home affairs who have told us that it could take 20 25 days for the papers to be processed we are hoping that the papers come through before the start of the season
4503194 but if it so happens that the papers dont come back in time then he will still play as a foreigner because his place is still open
4503195 the psl have informed me that if we register him as a foreigner now we can still re register him again when his permanent residence papers come through
4503196 hes got four and ive got two so hes still leading the race
4503197 of my 13 years as a professional player i served with gordon for seven six at rangers and one at pirates we had a very good working relationship
4503198 as a coach i have modeled myself on what i learned from him im really looking forward to this opportunity of working with gordon
4503199 ive finally got a break into the elite league there are a lot of coaches my age breaking into the psl right now and i couldnt have asked for a better mentor than gordon its like serving an apprenticeship with the company
4503200 at training there are times when gordons about to say something and ill tell a player next to me that i know exactly what hes going to say i knew exactly what he wanted from me as a player and thats what i am trying to instill in the players now
4503201 what holds us in good stead is the experience weve brought in to add to last years squad that did so well in the play offs it will be a lot of hard work which has started already and there are very positive signs for the future
4503202 weve had to work harder with so much to get in within such a short time but the players are adapting quickly to our understanding of how the team should play
4503203 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics
4503204 but i hope that it alerted senator obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the church on this very critical and important area
4503205 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
4503206 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
4503207 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
4503208 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4503209 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4503210 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4503211 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4503212 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4503213 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4503214 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4503215 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4503216 im running for the seat for state house district 132

4503218 in my regular life i have a little brother who looks up to me so i just try to behave for him but people will still say whatever they want to
4503219 the biggest thing ive learned is that everything that seemed so important when you were younger just goes out the window what other people think of you you just dont care anymore when you get a bit older you become more comfortable with yourself

4503222 i thought we really could have had some running plays come screaming out of there we were one block away
4503223 this is a competition that is going to go to the last day of camp so it cant be our focus
4503224 on all of us as a group there were a couple holes we needed to hit better and there were a couple holes that werent there we have to clean it up
4503225 i dont want to read too much into the running game
4503226 its not where it needs to be but it wasnt horrible either we have to fine tune it a little bit
4503227 we better be able to run the ball though i want to throw it when we want to throw it when you have to throw it thats when you have problems

4503508 its a very exciting time for the green party and its a special honour to have elizabeth may with us tonight
4503509 im very happy to be here tonight because this upcoming by election is an amazing opportunity for the green party to gain influence in quebec and at the national level
4503510 the more idealistic we are the more realistic we are
4503511 claude william is bringing politics of hope and ambition to westmount ville marie with your vote we can change the landscape of politics in september
4503512 this year we have the biggest and the boldest budget for a campaign in the history of the green party in quebec
4503513 we need it because its a difficult campaign not a lot of people vote for the by election
4503514 yes this is something that we see happen after major sporting events such as the super bowl world series and national basketball association nba playoffs that can extend into the wee hours of the night i am willing to bet that the same phenomenon will occur during the november elections these events are in real time so obviously people on the west coast have fewer problems the next day than do people who live on the east coast i wouldnt be surprised if half the viewers were more exhausted than the athletes doing the races
4503515 most people are like i can stay up later and watch the olympics for one night and they do and get into it so it becomes a pattern and after three or four nights they are exhausted the good news is that the olympics are time limited the games began on aug 8 and end on aug 24

4503536 if this course were to be followed managers throughout the economy would find it more rewarding to put pressure on government to secure emissions rights than to find and to apply low emissions ways of going about their business we wouldnt find enough new ways to reduce emissions at low cost

4503553 in one blow russia has managed to do something it had not done for years which is to assert its role as the regional security manager after seeing that role dissipate from the mid 1990s
4503554 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years
4503555 will the russians be prepared to intervene again if there is an ethnic conflict involving russians in ukraine or if they cant agree with kiev about their lease on sevastopol the black sea port the russian navy is due to vacate in 2017
4503556 will now swallow hard before making any attempt to recover their own separatist areas
4503557 from the mid 1990s until now every time russian power and influence has been tested around the periphery of the old soviet space russia has been found wanting
4503558 putin could not stop the baltic states joining the eu and nato he could not do anything about the pro western orange revolution in ukraine and the rose revolution in georgia and he couldnt manage the presidential successions in turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan the way moscow would have in the past

4503564 they rented a couple of pairs of plastic climbing boots and some harnesses they seemed to have the basics like packs and clothing they were really well set up with that
4503565 over the whole area the avalanche risk is high to extreme
4503566 its a technical climb the easiest way to do it is straight forward in good conditions but theres always the danger of avalanches

4503590 senator mccain encouraged based on the merits that the administration fund a project in the submission of its budget that would be subject to debate in the house and the senate
4503591 you make your case and let the regular order of the legislative process determine whether its a national priority thats precisely how the process is supposed to work
4503592 earmarks refer to congressional provisions that direct approved funds to be spent on specific projects or that direct specific exemptions from taxes or mandated fees

4503621 the road map the agenda if you like that we came into government with in 1996 had almost been fully realised there was a sense the government had run out of inspiration

4503623 all the things we fretted about 10 years ago like unemployment the collapse of traditional industries multiculturalism immigration we had moved on from partly because government policy had changed things in ways that made people feel better these were not a problem any more but this means that other issues come up for people to be less contented about
4503624 david hickss dad stood there and told it like it was

4503641 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
4503642 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
4503643 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
4503644 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
4503645 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

4503653 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4503654 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4503655 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4503656 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4503657 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4503658 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4503659 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4503660 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4503661 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4503662 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic

4503667 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy

4503670 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war

4503676 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
4503677 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4503678 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4503679 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4503680 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4503681 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4503682 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4503683 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4503684 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4503685 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4503686 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4503687 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4503688 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4503689 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4503690 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4503692 although stevens knowingly carried debt on a 31 000 interest free loan from his personal friend for more than 10 months during 2001 stevens did not list such a liability on his 2001 disclosure form
4503693 allen offered to get stevens daughter a new car in exchange for the 1999 land rover and stevens agreed
4503694 for the purpose of hiding allens involvement in the transaction
4503695 i saw sen stevens at lunch and he asked if you im not sure why he mentioned it to me but he asked me to i think find out if you had any business contacts in phoenix with respect to his son who is down there who finds himself without a job at this point
4503696 stevens son accepted the position with veco and also received a personal loan from allen

4503701 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4503702 a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction

4503719 hes well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised actually with the condition he was in
4503720 so for the next three weeks hell go on that rehabilitation and then the final parts of it and into endurance work and serious running before he gets into the football side with us
4503721 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4503722 so compared to wednesday night nasri and kolo are back in the squad
4503723 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
4503724 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
4503725 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4503726 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile he is also very young the same age as cesc fabregas we now have a very young generation which can develop together

4503729 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
4503730 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
4503731 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
4503732 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle
4503733 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4503734 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
4503735 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
4503736 our work has the potential to result in new therapeutic drugs for a broad range of diseases this work also provides an exciting example of the increased complexity with which we are engineering biological systems to address global societal challenges

4503742 if we decide to go with him we will go see eminem and get 1 000 000 and we already have 1 000 000 but we figured the 1 000 000 was fake but that does not matter what matteres sic to me is getting out of here and getting home

4503749 that doesnt help my crew because ive not been able to put many consecutive laps together and this morning wasnt too good for us we struggled to find the right set up for this new surface
4503750 this afternoon we went with a harder compound front tyre similar to what we used at laguna and sachsenring which is about the hardest weve got and we had to work on the geometry to get the most effective load on the front tyre
4503751 the guys improved the bike every time i came in so it was frustrating not to be able to put it all together with a long run we still have a lot of work to do so hopefully ill feel better tomorrow and the weather holds out for us
4503752 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4503753 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future

4503755 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4503756 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4503757 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4503758 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia

4503765 we need something that duplicates our facilities on the east coast and the west coast
4503766 transport canada is also proposing to make the reporting of ship information in the arctic waters mandatory
4503767 nunavuts a very very large very vast territory and the marine waters are vast as well
4503768 so are there potentially cruise ships or other ships coming in that people arent aware about i think theres potential for that
4503769 and that wouldnt be right for the people that work there if they want to unionize obviously theres something not going well with management but as far as professional ethics go these people have rights and they should be voiced

4503776 ik reageer even op uw bericht over de zgn relmuizen of eikelmuizen vorige week heeft mijn pa in zijn tuin een beestje gezien dat heel goed op de foto leek hij zag het slechts van de

4504239 today was quite bad but im here to learn for the future
4504240 my goals are higher for the long jump and im hoping to do the qualification well and go to the final and hopefully do my best
4504241 when im on the track i want to focus on my own event
4504242 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4504243 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4504244 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4504245 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4504246 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4504247 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4504248 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased williams down and made him work to explode and cut
4504249 hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light right now were still on yellow and were still working hard
4504250 why does cote divoire have 76 religions while norway has 13 and why does brazil have 159 religions while canada has 15 even though in both comparisons the countries are similar in size
4504251 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4504252 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4504253 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4504254 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4504255 i was singing it and a chill just came over me and i knew it was him
4504256 i get through because i know hes in a better place now
4504257 shes a businesswoman and sees her shows as work not a party for all of her friends she doesnt think having celebrities in the front seats makes her cool
4504258 this is a massive club we strive to be the best we can and weve brought in some fantastic players
4504259 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4504260 so compared to wednesday night nasri and kolo are back in the squad
4504261 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
4504262 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
4504263 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4504264 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile he is also very young the same age as cesc fabregas we now have a very young generation which can develop together
4504265 no se llega a la cifra m nima necesaria para cubrir las atenciones sanitarias
4504266 ahora nos encontramos en n meros rojos de cara a la feria de m laga que aunque se produce en un periodo de disminuci n en la cirug a programada siempre hay muchos accidentes de tr fico y heridos de arma blanca durante las fiestas
4504267 desde el pasado mes de abril ha disminuido el n mero de donantes
4504268 las donaciones recibidas oscilan entre las 130 y las 170 en los mejores casos
4504269 los donantes est n de vacaciones a todos los efectos pero los enfermos no descansan
4504270 poco a poco y cada vez m s se van solidarizando con la causa

4504274 by late this afternoon wed made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping again from some of our distribution centers
4504275 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday
4504276 but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4504277 everyone who should have received a disc but didnt because of our issues will receive a credit which we communicate to them via e mail
4504278 i dont understand how anyone sleeps past 6 00 i find those hours before 9 to be the most productive of the day
4504279 i dont understand how anyone falls asleep before midnight i find those hours after 9 to be the most peaceful and enjoyable maybe its because all those priggish morning people are asleep
4504280 there are billions of taxpayer dollars being funneled to both american and foreign companies often through no bid contracts ongoing pentagon audits have revealed that vast sums of this money have been misspent or improperly recorded the american people deserve a better accounting from this administration of who these contractors are why they are being used instead of u s troops how they are being monitored and whether they represent a cost effective use of american resources
4504281 the bush administrations move to outsource large portions of the iraq war effort sets a dangerous precedent the increasing use of private contractors restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers

4504283 i can do it cheaper and faster than the other guy
4504284 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4504285 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4504286 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4504287 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4504288 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4504289 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4504290 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4504291 nem sempre tive este desenvolvimento mas coloquei todo meu esfor o em expandir a largura de minhas costas e aqui estou eu hoje um dos melhores do mundo neste esporte
4504292 quanto mais aberta for sua pegada mais voc atinge a por o lateral de seus dorsais e esta por o que far suas costas ficarem largas

4504294 para desenvolver a densidade em toda a musculatura das costas ap s algumas semanas eu sempre mudo todos os exerc cios para dar a minha musculatura um novo impulso para crescer
4504295 eu n o me importe com quem voc seja e qu o forte treine voc nunca vai ter uma rvore de natal com uma dieta relaxada este o segredo

4504297 viva la vida and im totally blow away by it as of this writing i think it is the best album that coldpplay has made though a rush of blood to the head
4504298 i dont want to battle from beginning to end something something something i dont want to follow death and all of his friends
4504299 i dont want to watch too many episodes of friends no that wont do i dont want to listen to radioheads the bends no i dont want to eat any jerry and bens no
4504300 bitch not all americans want to fuck your day up damn
4504301 what the hell do you have to be so tormented about
4504302 we continue to have record months of fundraising this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before
4504303 which gives us plenty enough money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4504304 each day now we seem to get another stat that indicates oil consumption is slowing but im not an oil bull yet ive been hurt too many times by false breakouts to the downside by this market
4504305 ill keep watching consumption data in china and india if consumption growth there continues to slow then ill put oil short trades on
4504306 the key number will be oil inventories that will influence the market if u s oil inventories rise that would be another bearish data point
4504307 theyll be less focus on gasoline supplies because the summer driving season is ending
4504308 bring it back later and youll get that coffee for 2
4504309 clearly the future direction of interest rates and employment levels will impact on the environment in which the company will be operating in fiscal 2009
4504310 in these circumstances it is not possible at this time to accurately forecast results for the 2009 year
4504311 tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4504312 proceeding with the pulp mill strengthens the underlying business adds demonstrable value that should lead to market upgrades and a positive share price re rating
4504313 if you look at all the factors that have challenged the automotive industry over the past 10 years youd have to say that tariff reduction was not one of the most weighty issues
4504314 exchange rate issues worldwide competition the open market we have here weigh much more heavily
4504315 the review is wide ranging and makes a number of significant recommendations
4504316 the continuation of a competitive investment scheme is a positive step as is further clarification of the green car fund
4504317 however the decline in tariffs from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in 2010 is a concern for the industrys ability to compete on a global scale
4504318 we need to look at it on a level playing field
4504319 brazil runs a 35 per cent tariff and china is 25 per cent
4504320 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology into australia so it is more of a challenge for us here
4504321 there are other countries out there that value their auto industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4504322 so the tariff piece of this report is something were going to have to discuss and analyse
4504323 it is going to have an impact here on what money we feed back into the economy
4504324 it certainly has a short term effect on how we re invest our money here
4504325 if we have to spend money to price compete with some of the people that bring products at very low cost into this country it diverts some of our re investment opportunity for the future
4504326 australia has one of the safest aviation systems in the world
4504327 we know we dont have a systemic problem with maintenance and safety but some of the stuff were seeing published is pretty crazy
4504328 the cost pressures in every legacy carrier are just as intense as in qantas
4504329 all well established carriers have therefore increased the risk levels associated with maintenance throughout the world over the last decade
4504330 given that qantas had a leading position 10 years as the worlds safest then in all honesty it is probably still there
4504331 whats playing out is the tension of outsourcing everything and the timely and quality maintenance that was traditionally done by airlines
4504332 it just means that someone didnt lock it down properly before take off
4504333 legally qantas did not have to replace it and they could have flown on without a problem
4504334 a lot of these things are found when planes are on the ground and thats what the inspections are there for
4504335 they havent applied to recommence any exploration drilling nor would i consider it at this stage
4504336 wall street provided a good lead but weve seen spot gold come off oil was a bit weaker overnight and there was a fairly sharp rally in commodity stocks yesterday
4504337 equity traders remain sceptical as over bought commodity prices tumbled through the week on slowing global growth and stronger us dollar
4504338 we have no short term refinancing risk a well located diversified property portfolio and an experienced asset management team in tokyo
4504339 to be repaid in full in the normal course of the funds operations
4504340 the board may offer cps holders the opportunity to convert their cpss into ordinary shares
4504341 i think the first thing you will see is free trade agreements are toast
4504342 the notion of us bilateral free trade agreements with east asian countries will not happen forget about it its over
4504343 much of what the coming president implements in terms of economic policy will be dictated by what the us public wants
4504344 and the american public is not thrilled with higher taxes and higher energy prices either
4504345 although both candidates have at times stressed fiscal responsibility their specific non health tax proposals would reduce tax revenues by an estimated 4 2 trillion mccain and 2 8 trillion obama over the next 10 years
4504346 he has smart people even if you look at his senate record the only track record he is on is national and on global economic issues he is skimpy
4504347 obama is very skilled in a ceo type role he is comfortable getting able people to manage things
4504348 mccain has less of a management record clearly while hes been a successful candidate he hasnt run the smooth campaign that obama has
4504349 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
4504350 they say theyre not going to allow bikes down in and im wondering you know how its going to be with my scooter
4504351 a lot of the issues that are bothering the homeless community right now is how the people that are coming in to st paul for the convention how theyre going to perceive them thats what theyre basically worried about their privacy or you know being caught up in one of the protests and theyre not a part of it but theyre standing there
4504352 the challenges we know how to do that and weve been working really closely with the city and the rnc had great cooperation with the secret service and other folks as well and were meeting those challenges the opportunity is also great and thats the trade off of being center stage in the city is we often get opportunities to address issues in the city that we wouldnt get if we were around the corner
4504353 everybody and their mother whenever they want to endorse their tax plan they want to cite the almighty ronald reagan right i mean everybody wants to dump all over the republicans but when they want to tout their economic and their tax plan who do they go back to the guy who cut taxes and cut taxes
4504354 well i mean we learned a great lesson and in the larger scope of economic events we won
4504355 we dont think anyone whos trained in economics wants to go back to marginal tax rates of 70 to 80 percent that was the original obama plan and you can that see hes dialing it back because if you go to that agenda its bad for the economy and its unpopular
4504356 weve got an economy thats very weak that has all sorts of problems from housing to high energy prices to credit difficulties and this plan even taken at face value raises taxes
4504357 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4504358 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4504359 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkahzia and south ossetia
4504360 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible

4504367 strikes a crucial balance between sophisticated visual and content design on the one hand and the market s demand for availability legibility and durability on the other
4504368 in the first month of the show my web site got 1 million 700 000 hits who would have imagined that a graphic design show would have that kind of impact
4504369 i do stuff that punch you in the mouth sometimes

4504378 you bet your ass we will i hate your guts
4504379 there can only be one creative agency in the world
4504380 well the way you did it where a creative man runs the agency
4504381 i think we should do this and i think we should do this
4504382 is that the way you work with tom wolfe and norman mailer
4504383 outside but how could he understand what was going on
4504384 when i first meet my advertising clients i dont know what the hell theyre talking about two days later i know more than they know and then i can tell them something that they dont know
4504385 hell let me think about it and i started writing down names
4504386 listen pal could you do me a favor one favor could you do me just one cover because i dont know what the hell youre talking about
4504387 see that cover we had nothing to do with it its not what we think it was made by a designer named george lois
4504388 im gonna sell your magazine your magazine is too good not to be read im going to make a great package for it
4504389 what do you think of this cover do you like it what do you think of the red logo would blue be better
4504390 and i really ripped into them not only for that but also for their covers and i got an incredible response i had people calling me and every editor you can think of thinks im god but nothing happened nothing changes
4504391 tina look at that newsstand its a pattern theyre all the same if you put any one of my covers in there it would knock you on your ass
4504392 sure george lois is a genius but the covers didnt work
4504393 aim at heaven you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither
4504394 will speak on barack obamas commitment to a stronger and safer america as well as the history of democrats making positive change in the lives of all americans
4504395 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4504396 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4504397 aim at heaven you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither
4504398 perl has pretty much disappeared when it comes to the web
4504399 i would ask him what ticketmaster and amazon use for their back ends
4504400 perl has a very large user base in web apps but also has a strong presence in the financial industry
4504401 301 moved permanently turn to pages 61 64 502 for more information
4504402 the meetings were good and i got to see a lot of my friends there was
4504403 yes thats his name yaakov different people have different sounding names hes very nice and i saw
4504404 thats his name michael schwern and he is pretty funny we
4504405 and there were people from all over the world i had pizza last night with abigail and he came from the netherlands in europe
4504406 hes a man named abigail why is he named abigail
4504407 because thats his name and i also saw my friend barbie who is a man from england
4504408 if only there were some magical way that we could have a website where people could link to their own blog posts without me having to do it some sort of software preferably running on perl
4504409 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life
4504410 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that areimportant to you
4504411 pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness spend time with your children spend time with your parents visit with grandparents
4504412 one of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented
4504413 neurologists have determined that 90 per cent of brain growth occurs by age three without adequate levels of care and support without exposure to everyday experiences and stimulation a childs development may be damaged once the critical period 0 4 is past that system of the brain will never be able to develop or function normally these years are irreplaceable
4504414 it may well be that the connection between riches and happiness is looser than most economic and political commentators
4504415 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes
4504416 they are being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4504417 my race was solid but above all it showed that my summer training is keeping me in contention with some of the best cross country skiers and biathletes in the east
4504418 this was an encouraging result against strong competition from across the region

4504431 what in the hell is the matter with this society
4504432 i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky
4504433 parents are alarmed by an unsettling new fad in middle schools oral sex
4504434 i think so at least among the 50 girls that i talked to this was pervasive
4504435 one more opportunity for male satisfaction and female degradation in the name of adolescent sexual curiosity
4504436 requires believing that a boy could be serviced at the school bus train party receiving oral sex from ten or fifteen girls one after another and then zip his fly and head off to homeroom first stopping in the stairwell for a quickie to tide him over until math
4504437 weve made a world for our girls in which the pornography industry has become increasingly mainstream
4504438 in which planned parenthoods response to the oral sex craze has been to set up a help line in which the forces of feminism have worked relentlessly to erode the patriarchy which despite its manifold evils held that providing for the sexual safety of young girls was among its primary reasons for existence and here are americas girls experienced beyond their years lacking any clear message from the adult community about the importance of protecting their modesty adrift in one of the most explicitly sexualized cultures in the history of the world here are americas girls on their knees

4504441 aberrante que refleja el desequilibrio que existe en algunos tribunales del estado que utilizan recursos de ley para desfavorecer y criminalizar las luchas obreras
4504442 no se pueden seguir utilizando los tribunales del estado para tratar como criminales a quienes defendemos los derechos de los trabajadores no entendemos el inter s que tiene este se or fiscal de nombre jaime alexander mart nez lugo de con tanta firmeza solicitar medida de privativa de libertad en contra de 18 trabajadoras y trabajadores de esta empresa y de tres dirigentes de la uni n nacional de trabajadores entre ellos el dirigente stalin p rez borges coordinador nacional y delegado principal por los trabajadores de venezuela en la 97 conferencia de la oit nos gustar a observar la misma celeridad para la investigaci n por el disparo que recibi en la pierna la dirigente sindical gloria palomino
4504443 con la figura de la autoridad regional todos los rganos y entes desconcentrados de la administraci n p blica nacional van a subordinarse funcional y operativamente a la autoridad pero siguen dependiendo de sus rganos de adscripci n
4504444 ahora en la figura de la autoridad regional damos atribuciones a una sola persona que se va a ocupar tanto de la planificaci n que hacen los presidentes de las corporaciones como de la gesti n de proyectos espec ficos gracias a esta figura podemos coordinar con los distintos rganos de la administraci n central que hay en las regiones
4504445 cuando digan a ti gobierno central te toca hacer esto pero tambi n nosotros podemos identificar omisiones que son competencia de gobernaciones o alcald as
4504446 pues para eso van a tener un sujeto de alto nivel en el sitio viviendo en las regiones para hacer sus peticiones por eso lejos de querer transgredir o eliminar las competencias de las gobernaciones y alcald as lo que queremos es m s bien complementarnos ayudarnos y trabajar mucho m s cerca esta autoridad no estar a por encima de las gobernaciones y alcald as porque repito estoy hablando de un ente rector de los entes de la administraci n p blica centralizada
4504447 en consecuencia el ciudadano hugo ch vez fr as presidente de la rep blica bolivariana de venezuela contin a en el ejercicio de dicha presidencia
4504448 primero fue el golpe de estado de 2002 luego que es derrotado ese golpe por la unidad c vico militar posteriormente viene la huelga general de dos meses y medio y para finalizar toda la campa a de car cter internacional que se quiso hacer en funci n de tratar de pedir un refer ndum revocatorio
4504449 adem s se descubri la forma como se hab an recogido las firmas para el presidente pero sin embargo a pesar de eso y de que fueron firmas planas fuimos al refer ndum y nos fuimos a contar siendo una gran victoria del pueblo venezolano y del liderazgo de hugo ch vez en el pa s
4504450 primero quisieron hacerlo consultivo y luego revocatorio pero el tribunal supremo de justicia dictamin que eso no pod a ser un refer ndum consultivo sino revocatorio en definitiva ellos han hecho de todo para tratar de salir del presidente ch vez y esa es la actuaci n de la oligarqu a no s lo venezolana sino internacional
4504451 en venezuela el gobierno bolivariano la revoluci n y el presidente ch vez abrieron la puerta de la consciencia en latinoam rica para decirle al mundo que otros gobiernos que favorezcan a las mayor as son posibles que hay un mundo distinto y que en latinoam rica pueden y ocurren cosas para ejemplo del mundo
4504452 toda aquella intolerancia que exist a en el pa s termin desembocando en un conducto democr tico en ese sentido el pueblo venezolano dio una gran lecci n de democracia
4504453 es a partir de la constituci n de la rep blica bolivariana de venezuela que empieza a emplearse esta figura democr tica en los momentos de crisis antes la crisis en los pa ses por lo menos en am rica latina lo resolv an con un golpe de estado se resolv an violentamente
4504454 ya no es una c pula de partidos ni militar ni de un tribunal que decide c mo salir o no de un presidente fue el pueblo en el ejercicio de la democracia participativa y protag nica quien decidi y quien ratific al presidente de la rep blica
4504455 ese refer ndum fue afirmatorio y ratificador para el presidente siendo adem s la primera experiencia en el mundo que un presidente se sometiera a un refer ndum revocatorio siendo de esta manera claro ejemplo de democracia
4504456 es de clara importancia para todo aquel revolucionario y venezolano amante de la patria y de los estados de derecho justicia y equidad avanzar hacia un nuevo modelo de pa s en donde todos tengan participaci n y puedan gozar del beneficio de nuestros recursos estrat gicos

4504459 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4504460 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4504461 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4504462 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4504463 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4504464 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4504465 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4504466 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4504467 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4504468 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4504469 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4504470 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4504471 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4504472 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4504473 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4504474 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4504475 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4504476 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4504477 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4504478 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4504479 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4504480 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4504481 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4504482 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4504483 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4504484 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4504485 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4504486 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4504487 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4504488 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4504489 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4504490 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4504491 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4504492 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4504493 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4504494 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4504495 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4504496 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4504497 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4504498 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4504499 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4504500 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4504501 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4504502 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4504503 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4504504 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4504505 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4504506 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4504507 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4504508 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4504509 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4504510 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4504511 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4504512 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4504513 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4504514 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4504515 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4504516 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4504517 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4504518 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4504519 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4504520 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4504521 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4504522 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4504523 just so you all know we did set a record
4504524 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4504525 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4504526 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4504527 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4504528 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4504529 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4504530 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4504531 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4504532 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4504533 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4504534 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4504535 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4504536 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4504537 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4504538 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4504539 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4504540 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4504541 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4504542 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4504543 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4504544 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4504545 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4504546 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4504547 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4504548 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4504549 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4504550 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4504551 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4504552 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4504553 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4504554 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4504555 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4504556 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4504557 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4504558 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4504559 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4504560 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4504561 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4504562 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4504563 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4504564 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4504565 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4504566 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4504567 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4504568 the recycling of paper and plastic products to conserve energy can be a source of employment for the nations teeming unemployed youth
4504569 youth organizations must influence policies by government as well as help raise awareness on climate change
4504570 it is a bad deal we have given a commitment that if we win the election we have hinted vodafone we shall reverse the deal
4504571 the unconditional release of their frozen salaries after embarking on strike some two years ago
4504572 our quest to become a middle income country by the year 2015 largely depends on the type of education given to the young ones who find themselves in schools today
4504573 the programme is to reduce rural poverty through agricultural transformation we are of the view that success in agriculture as a business will come only if the farming communities also benefit from improved school infrastructure for the children of farmers in these farming communities
4504574 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4504575 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4504576 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4504577 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4504578 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4504579 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4504580 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4504581 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4504582 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4504583 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4504584 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4504585 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4504586 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4504587 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4504588 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4504589 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4504590 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4504591 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4504592 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4504593 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4504594 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4504595 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4504596 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4504597 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4504598 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4504599 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4504600 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4504601 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4504602 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4504603 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4504604 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4504605 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4504606 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4504607 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4504608 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4504609 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4504610 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4504611 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4504612 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4504613 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4504614 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4504615 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4504616 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4504617 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4504618 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4504619 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4504620 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4504621 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4504622 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4504623 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4504624 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4504625 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4504626 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4504627 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4504628 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4504629 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4504630 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4504631 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4504632 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4504633 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4504634 for us in the nfed there is nothing more refreshing and resuscitating than to see that those we helped and supported are developing and growing
4504635 my mom and dad dont want us to watch commercials
4504636 as ssd technology progresses ocz will continue to release updated and enhanced solutions to ensure our customers stay on the leading edge
4504637 the new core v2 drives offer consumers and system integrators increased capacities up to 250gb improved read and write performance and faster seek time all coupled with a new mini usb port empowering customers with the ability to further improve performance and compatibility by updating firmware in the future
4504638 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4504639 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4504640 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4504641 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4504642 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4504643 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4504644 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4504645 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4504646 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4504647 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4504648 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4504649 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4504650 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4504651 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4504652 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4504653 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4504654 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4504655 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4504656 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4504657 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4504658 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4504659 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4504660 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4504661 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4504662 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4504663 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4504664 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4504665 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4504666 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4504667 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4504668 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4504669 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4504670 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4504671 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4504672 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4504673 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4504674 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4504675 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4504676 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4504677 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4504678 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4504679 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4504680 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4504681 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4504682 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4504683 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4504684 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4504685 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4504686 we have created greater access to quality health care in texas
4504687 so you have to understand what i mean when i say i want to make washington d c and the rest of our country more like texas because frankly we know the policies that actually work
4504688 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4504689 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4504690 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4504691 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4504692 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4504693 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4504694 with many people injured and many more fleeing their homes as a result of the conflict medical and relief supplies are urgently needed
4504695 our initial support will go to help extend the relief work of the icrc on the ground while we evaluate additional response options
4504696 we see a need for basic things such as food water and hygiene items at the shelter centers we are visiting both in and around tbilisi and in zugdidi in western georgia
4504697 so that when theres a disease outbreak health officials have some idea how to answer what if questions
4504698 once you understand how much interaction there is you can actually start predicting when you think the disease will get to other groups
4504699 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4504700 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4504701 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4504702 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4504703 actually what happened is that i was at work and i went to my friends at work and i said you guys youre actually going to run with me on august 24 th and they were so excited about being able to do this for all the fallen soldiers
4504704 and then i thought i bet there are more people who would want to come out and do this
4504705 there are bigger perhaps more urgent things that kenya is grappling with than the issues which initially caused my departure
4504706 theres a very definite sense that something has changed in the way people relate with one another especially along ethnic lines
4504707 ive had some re assurances from top officials in the government
4504708 im going back to kenya because kenya is my country and i want to be with my family and my people
4504709 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4504710 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4504711 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4504712 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4504713 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4504714 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4504715 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases
4504716 i had an experience with a yorkshire terrier that was given bacon every morning for breakfast
4504717 anything greasy fatty or salty is not good the dog would end up skipping meals waiting on the bacon
4504718 its just like with humans animals dont need them because there is no real benefit
4504719 i feel it leads to a lot of problems health and behavioral problems
4504720 one serving of bacon is like a weeks worth for them
4504721 they do what works and if it doesnt work they dont do it
4504722 im disappointed you feel like youve made a fool of yourself
4504723 im disappointed because my training has been going well in the last year
4504724 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4504725 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4504726 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4504727 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4504728 he was ambitious idealistic and i think he had something of the american messianic sense that you could use law to change the world
4504729 this was at a time of turmoil in the ex soviet republics and he had a lot to say on those topics
4504730 pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
4504731 military adventure had all the hallmarks of rushed planning and a finger crossed strategy
4504732 the opportunity he was waiting for to stamp his authority over georgia and at the same time to cock a snoot at the west
4504733 let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
4504734 he clearly knew what he wanted when he was at columbia and he chose his courses very carefully and in a conscious way that didnt follow the usual diet which is corporate and securities law
4504735 he is a western person and a very dedicated person very dedicated to human rights
4504736 saakashvili may be a complex personality and he has certainly made mistakes but he has given the civil society breathing space
4504737 compared with its neighbors in the region such as the northern caucasus region in russia but also armenia azerbaijan and eastern turkey georgia is more liberal more open and more committed to the rule of law
4504738 given the current composition of the court and their avowed hostility to the policy you are seeking to advance
4504739 there are bigger perhaps more urgent things that kenya is grappling with than the issues which initially caused my departure
4504740 theres a very definite sense that something has changed in the way people relate with one another especially along ethnic lines
4504741 ive had some re assurances from top officials in the government
4504742 im going back to kenya because kenya is my country and i want to be with my family and my people
4504743 blogging and writing about its legal implications heres part of his abstract on the interplay between competition and privacy
4504744 i havent even got a scrap of cheese to cheer me up
4504745 all ive got is an apple my stepmother gave me just before i was arrested
4504746 if its anything like the one she gave me the other day
4504747 its me mickey mouse dont eat that apple its poisoned
4504748 oh i forgot we cant afford healthcare so much for the protesting
4504749 what are we to do minnie will be terribly upset
4504750 its all right for you youngsters but minnie has seen the last of her youth she needs regular doses of that elixir to cope with her arthritis
4504751 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4504752 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4504753 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs
4504754 both militants received dog bite injuries one of which required treatment on scene by coalition medical personnel
4504755 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4504756 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4504757 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4504758 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4504759 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4504760 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4504761 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4504762 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4504763 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4504764 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4504765 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4504766 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4504767 i could no more disown reverend wright than i could disown my grandmother
4504768 all that work all those tests this recipe must make the best fill in the blank ever
4504769 gee if i had skipped that extra step where i had to roast those tomatoes for several hours or if id added an extra teaspoon of salt would this really have tasted sub par would i be cursing myself for being lazy and careless and not doing exactly what the cooks illustrated geniuses told me to do

4504776 this valentines day show the ones you care about how much you love them
4504777 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4504778 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth
4504779 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4504780 this is yet more evidence that the dna database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons
4504781 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4504782 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4504783 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4504784 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4504785 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4504786 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4504787 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4504788 the bbc need an alternative and graham is their man

4504802 the states unemployment rate rose slightly to 4 7 percent

4504804 the month when everyone with half a brain gets the hell out of atlanta

4504810 yes totoo yon ah siguro kung meron lang akong very again ha very very very very slight na parang bakit kasi last minute
4504811 nag pack up sila at twelve midnight so nag cost implication dahil ready na lahat e alas dose na yun yun lang
4504812 nag usap kami ni kris by chance napadaan ako sa dressing room niya tinawag niya ako alangan naman ako ang tumawag ah sinabi niya yon
4504813 nung narinig ko yung explanation niya ang una kong sinabi naku huwag na huwag na nating gawin kasi ayoko namang maano ang married life mo para lang sa isang guesting its not a whole movie its just an opening scene cameo
4504814 ah abangan nila kasi hanggang ngayon meron silang gusto na hindi pa ako ganun ka solve for an opening di ba
4504815 ayokong maging political ang dating ng movie namin ang pelikula ay tungkol sa isang ordinaryong nanay na may 12 na anak na menopausal na naging presidente ayokong maging political wala kaming ginawang spoof dito na gobyerno iningatan namin yun
4504816 dahil gusto ni kris siguro hoping din siya na habang dumadaan ang araw baka pumayag e hindi pumayag
4504817 tsaka ako lang si ai ai kasi ang nangyari niyan may show siya sa canada right after ng show dumiretso ng airport para dumating dito na pack up pala
4504818 so sana hindi nangarag yung babae na right after ng show dumiretso ng airport kung napaaga lang yung pack up other than that walang isyu yung kay ai ai sayang na stressed out siya habang nasa eroplano dahil nagmamadali pagdating dito packup
4504819 bakit nasi single out si dj na parang ang lupit lupit ninyo naman
4504820 hindi naman siya bida hindi naman siya dyos dyosa hindi naman siya si my girl hindi naman ako ang direktor noon pero bakit parang malupit yung magtrabaho ano gusto nila magnakaw yung tao yun lang ang question ko
4504821 as a manager bakit hindi ko tutulungang kumita tapos pag sinabi ko naman sa producer agad agad okey
4504822 last meeting lang ito wala po huh lagay mo sabi ni boss vic e wala pong role e mel yung writer lagay mo sabi niya ulit siyempre natutuwa ako pero pinapangatawanan ko na kung ilalagay ko na singit lang huwag na lang

4504824 tapos sasabihin nila kung anu ano ang mga comments na mag syota mag ano ibig mong sabihin lahat ng direktor ganun
4504825 pag sinasabi nilang basura ang trabaho ko bakit ako kinukuha ng abs cbn at bakit ako nakakaikot sa lahat gusto ba ng ibang produksyon gaya ng viva ng regal ng octo arts ng basurero o mas maganda sigurong sabihin ah siguro may pera sa basura
4504826 minsan kasi somehow may nakikita ako e wala naman akong pretension una sa paggawa ng pelikula ko very clear ang objective ko diyan to entertain
4504827 di siya tulad ng iba diyan kay sarah dapat seryoso ka talaga
4504828 all attempts to bring peace from the top down while ignoring what is happening in palestinian society are doomed to failure
4504829 when a state is on the way to being established civil society plays a strategic role
4504830 the peace process must be linked to building and strengthening palestinian civil society
4504831 bassem eid is not a great zionist and i am not a fighter for a palestinian state
4504832 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
4504833 democracy is never offered by leadership or governments democracy is obtained through determination of the people
4504834 it is high time that palestinian civil society be fully recognized by the international community as a prerequisite to peace not as an obstacle to it
4504835 i dont ever want lana to have a single thought cross her mind that she is not beautiful exactly the way that she is

4504847 we both had the same idea independently of each other to do photo exhibition on japan for various reasons we never got to it before she brought up the idea to do it together as a token of our friendship
4504848 at the same time i also met someone who had started making and selling japanese clothes modern ones but with a touch of tradition so my first plan was to combine a photo exhibition with her clothes but unfortunately shes had to leave sl for a while
4504849 after having been away for so long i couldnt find my way back to photography again especially nudes or avatars in general seikatsu picked the right moment for us to start on this project
4504850 we were very lucky to get some spontaneous help from people we met during our sim scouting
4504851 but im fascinated by what i see as a high tech modern society with a very strong sense of tradition i also like the minimalism in their art
4504852 i hope to make something with my japanese clothes making friend when she comes back then hopefully i will try to do something on clothes and maybe furniture as well
4504853 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to

4504855 but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose
4504856 i want to make it abundantly clear that fayose is not a leader of pdp in ekiti state because of his utterances and action
4504857 we have received a letter from his local government irepodun ifelodun local government recommending sanction against him based on these various anti party activities
4504858 former anpp office in ado ekiti is now ppa secretariat
4504859 in effect the cwc has therefore decided to immediately suspend him from the party
4504860 as the chairman i am prepared to accept responsibility for my actions while a level playing ground will be prepared for all stake holders for the good of our party especially at this time when our party is almost going under and needs to be salvaged
4504861 we have drawn the attention of both the zonal and national leaders of our party to this lingering problem in ekiti pdp and they have reacted swiftly by appointing a reconciliation committee to look into our complaints
4504862 in this circumstances the only option left is to form a structure for the pdp mainstream and stakeholders in order to resist a further rape of our political and constitutional rights
4504863 we want to assure our teeming supporters that we will adequately represent their interest we will function like a democratic institution which means that we shall observe the rule of law in our struggles
4504864 we shall not impose candidates because part of our mandate is to prepare our party members for the forthcoming local government elections
4504865 we will carry out a restructuring that will enhance the growth and restore the integrity of the party
4504866 it shows that they are jittery because if they claim to be the mainstream of the pdp in ekiti they need not go as far as abuja to be staging a protest against me or the authentic executive elected by the majority of party members few days ago
4504867 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4504868 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4504869 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4504870 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4504871 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4504872 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4504873 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4504874 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4504875 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4504880 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4504881 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4504882 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4504883 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change

4504903 there were some hopeful signs in last quarters survey suggesting that the economy might be bottoming out but weakness persists across the board the fact that firms continue to reduce planned growth in capital investment staff development and employment is particularly troubling since it suggests that slowdown could have longer term implications
4504904 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way
4504905 those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back
4504906 was just a way for us to put more pressure and we knew it would work at the end of the day
4504907 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4504908 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4504909 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4504910 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4504911 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4504912 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4504913 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
4504914 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever
4504915 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to
4504916 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it
4504917 i remember sitting down with frankie and said nick is in the hospital and hell be home in a couple of days
4504918 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4504919 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4504920 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4504921 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4504922 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4504923 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4504924 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4504925 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4504926 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4504927 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4504928 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour

4504940 reconsideration was granted but it does not look like we will be able to get the votes to get the bill off the senate floor
4504941 we tried to lobby the members to get the last few votes but unfortunately the fact that the bill went on call gave the opposition more time to lobby members to move into the no column
4504942 this bill was to be the beginning of the delta fishery restoration process and would have provided funds for the states impacted salmon fishery its defeat is a slap in the face to californias commercial and recreational anglers
4504943 we were counting on this bill as a funding mechanism for hundreds of projects needed to recover salmon
4504944 in spite of our successful efforts to move the bill through the assembly and two senate committees in the end we were outgunned by the intense lobbying of the water contractors and the administration the bill is dead for this year
4504945 do we give up absolutely not we come back next year better organized and with all the additional grassroots firepower we can muster we wont give up until we get the funding for mitigation and fish recovery if you are as mad as we are take the action that will help the most get everyone you know to sign onto water4fish org click and send letters to the politicians and give us the powerful proxy ammunition we can use

4504972 i taught math and science for five years at brogden middle school i did my internship in administration at the end of last school year and through the summer i really enjoyed that process this will be my first opportunity to work in administration so im about to find out firsthand if im going to enjoy it or if i want to go back to the classroom i think im going to enjoy it though
4504973 the thing im looking forward to the most is the teacher observations ill be doing the opportunity to go into classrooms and see what other teachers are doing what techniques they are employing to get the students attention is intriguing that is an opportunity that is not available to most teachers since you are always occupied with your own classroom im looking forward to working with the teachers im hoping to give them the resources they need to make the classroom successful as well as learn some things from them
4504974 im sure ill miss the opportunity to teach but im looking forward to the new challenges im going to enjoy working closely with the teachers i think i have really good people skills i think i possess some different ideas and approaches to teaching that will benefit the students i can get some ideas across in different ways as opposed to the old one two three steps i feel like i can help our teachers be effective in using those ideas and reaching all of our students

4504990 i am pleased that frans has agreed to serve as interim dean especially during such an exciting time for interdisciplinary science and engineering at harvard given his breadth of experience as a researcher teacher and administrator seas will be in excel lent hands
4504991 whats always impressed me about frans is his almost innate ability to meld leadership with partnership those who have been fortunate enough to work with him whether in the lab or the classroom always emphasize his skills as a mentor and collaborator
4504992 moreover frans work in materials science is part of a long tradition of world class research at harvard that spans not only engineering but physics chemistry and biology his ability to understand and appreciate such intellectual breadth makes him ideally suited to support seas continuing mission to foster links at harvard and con nect with the wider world
4504993 i am grateful for this opportunity to serve as the interim dean at seas
4504994 i was fortunate to have been a part of the marvelous transformation of engi neering and applied sciences at harvard over the past three decades the open collabo rative and interdisciplinary spirit that guided the activities at rowland is the very phi losophy that has made seas such a unique place among engineering schools i look forward to working even more closely with my colleagues to continue this tradition and to build on dean narayanamurtis many accomplishments of the recent years
4504995 frans will bring the same energy and drive to seas that he fostered while at rowland and i am thrilled that someone of his intellectual stature has agreed to serve
4504996 at the same time when it comes to leadership frans possesses a thoughtful quiet wisdom that will serve seas well especially as it continues to blossom into its new role as a school he is well known for enabling tal ented people to pursue excellence in all areas

4505002 when the winds are right and the wave sections like that then you really have to go big and pull aerials its just so much a part of surfing these days and to stay on top i think you have to be able to pull them

4505264 the decrease in revenue from the previous quarter was primarily driven by lower contract revenue as we got close to completion on significant projects the decrease in revenue from a year ago was due to decreases in patent royalties from fujitsu and qimonda and lower contract revenue
4505265 during the quarter we booked a non cash charge of 130 5 million to establish the valuation allowance against our u s deferred tax assets our history of cumulative gaap losses in recent years coupled with our revised outlook for the year led us to conclude that we may not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets according to fas 109 guidelines concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult particularly when there is significant evidence that is objective and verifiable such as accumulative gaap losses in recent years in our analysis we weighed all the evidence both positive and negative and determined that the deferred tax assets were impaired and a valuation allowance should be recognized
4505266 despite the obvious headwinds faced in the quarter we remain committed to a strategy that focuses on long term success we will continue to invest in technology development and fully fund our legal efforts nevertheless we intend to reduce our current cost structure through actions which may include downsizing our workforce in order to maintain the financial strength of the company in doing so we will continue to support our customers and ensure we follow through on the commitments made to them

4505316 my weight has always fluctuated and no matter how much weight i lost through diet and exercise i have always had certain stubborn areas of fat that i just could never seem to shift during the x factor i lost just under two stone but my body was still quite a boxy shape having liposuction has completely changed my shape giving me curves in all the right places clothes look so much better on me now and i feel a lot more feminine and in proportion i am so please with the results
4505317 mya ensured i understood that having liposuction is not a weight loss solution but is more about re shaping the body making it more streamlined
4505318 i did experience some bruising and swelling which is typical of the liposuction procedure and i really started to notice significant results after a few weeks once the swelling began to go down a couple of months on i cant believe the change it has made i never thought i would ever fit in to a pair of skinny jeans and now i do and they are a size 10 12

4505428 the move to mccormick place west gives us the space we need to continue growing the show while retaining our traditional dates maintaining the basic nature of the show and staying in the popular downtown chicago location

4505433 faz parte do processo de reforma pol tica acabar com o clientelismo uma das caracter sticas piores do clientelismo aquela rela o antiga em que o executivo s transfere recursos para os partidos da base de sustenta o e n o para os partidos de oposi o isso foi a grande contribui o do governo lula e para a modifica o de uma reforma pol tica na pr tica

4505438 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
4505439 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
4505440 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
4505441 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
4505442 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
4505443 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
4505444 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
4505445 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
4505446 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
4505447 thats a phenomenal speed and most people wont be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds let alone two hours
4505448 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits
4505449 olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve

4505455 whether your book is about pregnancy porn or plastic surgery mistakes the writing you do does not end with just your book and your word document to get buzz on yourself you have to promote you and your opinion and blogging can be a good way to do this
4505456 an interesting person who has something to say about the human condition worth paying attention to
4505457 i read the news to find reporters who write about topics that are similar to my book topic and me by looking for media opportunities to be quoted in news stories or to get your opinion out there you will be making yourself credible to book agents and publishers
4505458 if you don t know how to write about yourself and what you book is about then you should practice knowing how you and you book can relate to a certain topic is important for pitching the press and getting buzz
4505459 your self promotion can lead to bigger things and more opportunity you will be more likely to be picked up by a publisher or agent even after you self publish if you can show that your book is marketable
4505460 is your message so important that youd be willing to give over a huge chunk of your life to getting it out and if you cant say yes then why should you expect anybody else to care about your book either

4505467 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4505468 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go

4505488 if russia openly challenges ukrainian sovereignty i think that ukraine will then turn to the west and say you know guys theyre challenging our sovereignty with their fleet and this will happen without any kind of use of arms or anything made in anger ukraine right now apparently wants to make the threat to its sovereignty obvious to outside powers

4505508 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq

4505557 he is a lad with immense promise but at 26 years old he needs to start fulfilling that promise

4505567 the decision to lay off employees was an extremely difficult one and one we made only after exhausting other cost cutting measures and eliminating as many vacant positions and other expenses as possible
4505568 we are committed to top quality safe patient care and maintaining one of the highest nurse to patient staffing levels in the region the layoffs will not change that

4505576 our research also showed that most consumers didnt know the difference between a good and a bad shop
4505577 so when people go to a mechanic they dont know how to determine if the mechanic knows what hes doing and they almost always feel theyre being ripped off even when theyre not

4505579 people need to realize you want that inspection every time you get the oil changed its a perfect time to make sure everything is working and will go on working
4505580 and its all things consumers should consider as they evaluate a repair shop first we look for automotive service excellence ase certification and we want shops that have been in business at least 10 years
4505581 because a shop thats paying its bills doesnt cut corners
4505582 most of our shops havent had any issues even reported within the last three years
4505583 we have one shop that hasnt had a better business bureau complaint or issue in 35 years

4505595 i have set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 percent cost out of the supply chain

4505597 either that was a nice shot or that russian pilot just decided to unload on an abandoned bmp
4505598 i love him as a fella and a player hes a great pro and a great person
4505599 but i had to get some money in they are the rules of the game thats why he had to go we would not be sitting here now if it wasnt for him thats a fact
4505600 he kept us up that year when he scored that goal against manchester city no doubt about that and he would have been in my team on sunday
4505601 i have to balance the books though i had great offers for one or two other players but they didnt want to move they are quite happy to stay here and do what they do
4505602 and we know the owner alexandre gaydamak cant keep funding it its not a bottomless pit so in the end we had to accept the offer for pedro
4505603 we are short of three players that is what we need to be a squad who can compete on the domestic front and try to have a run in europe
4505604 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need

4505612 rolling up several expensive debts into one affordable monthly payment can make sense if you are faced with a myriad of claims on your money
4505613 finding a new tariff after each price hike may be the best way to keep on top of rising prices by applying a little regular legwork
4505614 that will mean in todays climate that they will be more cautious about lending its just another thing making it harder for borrowers to get a loan

4505628 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4505629 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4505630 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4505631 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4505632 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere
4505633 i shall not rest until all of us feel as much pain at the death of an unnamed child in africa as we would for the death of our own son or daughter

4505642 the kind of thing youd expect in a police state
4505643 im alleging that a person or persons have slandered me by accusing me of various things but mostly that im a drug dealer that i have killed an entire family in a car wreck while high on drugs and that i take bribes and pay bribes
4505644 i defy anybody anywhere to say that is protected by the first amendment
4505645 its anti democratic in other words our government officials should expect to be criticized to threaten someone with any sort of crime for doing that is nothing short of unacceptable

4505653 the market realized the loss in the chinese retailer xinyu which is estimated at 47 million swiss francs 42 78 million but underestimated the losses from their investments in equities and bonds
4505654 equity markets were down 21 0 in swiss francs in the first half of the year
4505655 it is only a valuation situation it is one of the best investments we have ever made those who invested in lehman brothers or ubs that were rated top those are the people who are in trouble
4505656 xinyu will post excellent results next august 28 in hong kong we have invested in the biggest chinese retailer and in the biggest retail distribution in the middle east these are fantastic regions to invest your money
4505657 our july and august sales continue to see double digit growth in local currency we posted a 15 0 increase in sales in dollar value
4505658 august seems to be very strong in the u s alone a place which is considered to be under a crisis recession and horrible scenarios
4505659 we are not immune to a recession nobody is but the hysterical approach to focus only on the luxury sector is dangerous because you need to develop the business in all areas and segments
4505660 its basically an expression of luck we feel fortunate to be able to do this for a decade and a half a lot of the songs that are on the record kind of express our contentment and our general acknowledgment of good fortune
4505661 weve done our share of work but a lot of bands that have worked hard for whatever reason have collapsed under its own weight for one reason or another weve been lucky to have fans who have supported us for such a long time
4505662 its been steadily growing for a decade or so that weve been playing there
4505663 everywhere weve played its always grown steadily the momentum of it has been very rewarding to be honest the last tour that we did for the last record was the first time the us passed canada in ticket sales and stuff so its very very thrilling and very exciting
4505664 were not a band that has a pile of choreography or loops
4505665 we have an interactive kind of night the tradition of music here at newfoundland where were from is very inclusive its not like a recital where you envy a virtuoso its more like the best singer is the guy who gets the most people to sing along the best accordion player is the guy who fills the dance floor the most often music is about a celebration and making it a great night
4505666 the drop in e commerce suggests that something happened that was different with e commerce than with retail
4505667 inflation is far and away the most important economic concern among all income groups
4505668 we are seeing the web continue to increase its influence in terms of transactions but also in terms of offline planning
4505669 there is a trend toward using the internet more in an effort to save on gasoline costs
4505670 as day follows night we can be pretty reasonably reassured that there will be a recovery
4505671 whats really going to have to happen is a full cleanup of all the bad assets out there
4505672 consumers arent going to be able to use their homes as cash machines anymore
4505673 in this credit environment we are going to see some retailers disappear
4505674 the good news for most of the retailers that do survive is that once the economy starts to recover there will be the opportunity to invest in the kind of things that will make them grow
4505675 once kids go through that programming theyre qualified to enter any college or university not just here in the united states but overseas

4505683 hard working hoosiers are suffering and losing their jobs while mitch daniels continues to live in a fantasy land for too long we have heard daniels claim that he has brought jobs to indiana but the 16 500 people whose jobs have disappeared can tell you differently the daniels economy is hurting hoosier families
4505684 the people of indiana deserve a governor who will exhibit true leadership and dedication to the struggles they face everyday the disturbing trends under mitch daniels just show that he is out of touch and out of line
4505685 these numbers will hopefully puncture even the bubble that mitch daniels is living in he cannot continue to sit idly by ignoring the fact that all around him people are struggling
4505686 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4505687 can tell the un what hes going to do about the sexual crimes committed by priests in his church during his tenure or maybe thats the connection boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4505688 this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4505689 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters it all goes together
4505690 why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary
4505691 anybody ask why hellary couldnt keep bj bill satisfied not lesbo or anything is she

4505694 world trade center dust forms the iron sphere that can only be formed at extremely high temperatures
4505695 jet fuel doesnt the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the wtc dust
4505696 because he has been revealed as the author of religiously bigoted remarks published on a web site corsi not only considers muslims to be pederasts but he took the trouble to slam catholic priests and refers to the pope as senile rather than wonder whether a book written by such a man can be trusted the marketing tactic has shifted to pretend corsi doesnt exist
4505697 we have several concerns about the possible deregulation of canada post
4505698 we encourage our members to speak up in defence of this crucial public service

4505700 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4505701 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4505702 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4505703 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4505704 olson again draws gop ire this time in the senate
4505705 franken tries to clear up confusion about his income tax problem but what he calls an honest mistake
4505706 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4505707 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4505708 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4505709 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4505710 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4505711 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4505712 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4505713 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4505714 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4505715 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4505716 this is a particularly significant achievement in that congress has made clear that online campus piracy is a problem requiring national attention
4505717 theres no immediate threat that any universities will lose funding only if they willfully do not comply
4505718 you dont want to play the u s till the gold medal game
4505719 at some point youre going to have to play the u s
4505720 for now we need to see who well play in the quarterfinals and not worry about after that everyone has a hiccup at some point during the tournament we just hope ours isnt in the playoffs
4505721 we know how good they are and what we have to do to beat them
4505722 we need to be focused to play russia its huge to win the pool and finish first
4505723 we lost to australia because we had just beaten the u s a we were too excited to have that game with australia
4505724 we dont have any pressure on us as everyone expects u s and australia to play in the finals
4505725 you dont want to play the u s till the gold medal game
4505726 at some point youre going to have to play the u s
4505727 for now we need to see who well play in the quarterfinals and not worry about after that everyone has a hiccup at some point during the tournament we just hope ours isnt in the playoffs
4505728 we know how good they are and what we have to do to beat them
4505729 we need to be focused to play russia its huge to win the pool and finish first
4505730 we lost to australia because we had just beaten the u s a we were too excited to have that game with australia
4505731 we dont have any pressure on us as everyone expects u s and australia to play in the finals
4505732 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get
4505733 a country as young prosperous healthy and intelligent as canada should be doing better
4505734 not to say it puts us on equal footing with australia
4505735 im not really upset with canadian athletes im upset with canada
4505736 we dont fund them we give them no money to train we dont focus on phys ed in school were closing pools
4505737 lets face it as competitors weve never been at the top of the list until we adopt a winning mentality and some patriotism we will always be content just being in mediocrity
4505738 the people who follow these sports between olympics they recognize the great performances
4505739 people who tune in just for the olympics they see the medal table and it looks like a disappointment
4505740 when we won the bid for the games we recognized that the atmosphere is impacted significantly by how the host country does
4505741 our athletes will be able to step on the snow and the ice feeling theyve had all the support they needed to meet the high expectations for them
4505742 i expected two or three fences down in my best dreams i didnt imagine this
4505743 i have been seven years in germany for this goal
4505744 my family lost a lot because i live alone in germany
4505745 i have not had a holiday since i joined the national team
4505746 endure all possible hardships go all out to achieve success start from nothing do ones utmost to catch up
4505747 look i am not an apologist for chinas environmental record its record and legacy are a traumatic one
4505748 but we have all seen the efforts being made at these olympics and they hold promise a bit less judgment for what chinas progressive leaders are trying to do might be appropriate at this stage
4505749 china did not start planting trees at the olympics that began 20 years ago now it is one of the only asian countries where forest cover is increasing the chinese have proven to themselves they are capable of far reaching innovation
4505750 china has some of the worst environmental problems in the world but it is paying more attention to both pollution and degradation they realise environmental degradation affects economic development
4505751 this should give the reformers and progressive environmental groups in the government far greater possibility for influence
4505752 people in beijing are not going to forget that the air can be cleaner
4505753 i have based my assessment on the empirical evidence i have no reason to doubt that the numbers are genuine
4505754 ive been to beijing a lot and walked outside so i felt the difference and subjectively if you compare it to an average day in nairobi you can taste more sulphur in the air there
4505755 i see china accelerating environmental efforts much more than other developing nations
4505756 improvement does not mean you have reached an optimum state of affairs though
4505757 i expected two or three fences down in my best dreams i didnt imagine this
4505758 i have been seven years in germany for this goal
4505759 my family lost a lot because i live alone in germany
4505760 we didnt have a very good heat but we came back and made some adjustments in the rep and we are going to try to build off of that
4505761 we have a system that does wrong by poor kids of color
4505762 if were going to live up to our promise as a country that has got to stop
4505763 the mentality of excellence we wish we could have that
4505764 then i popped it into my mouth and i ate it
4505765 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get
4505766 a country as young prosperous healthy and intelligent as canada should be doing better
4505767 not to say it puts us on equal footing with australia
4505768 im not really upset with canadian athletes im upset with canada
4505769 we dont fund them we give them no money to train we dont focus on phys ed in school were closing pools
4505770 lets face it as competitors weve never been at the top of the list until we adopt a winning mentality and some patriotism we will always be content just being in mediocrity
4505771 the people who follow these sports between olympics they recognize the great performances
4505772 people who tune in just for the olympics they see the medal table and it looks like a disappointment
4505773 when we won the bid for the games we recognized that the atmosphere is impacted significantly by how the host country does
4505774 our athletes will be able to step on the snow and the ice feeling theyve had all the support they needed to meet the high expectations for them
4505775 i came i saw i took a photo sanna motola aug 13 2008
4505776 memory is an intimate exploration of how we choose to remember events and the consequences of those choices from a group of actors and their director in the rehearsal room memory takes us to east berlin in 1990 just as the wall has come down a young man arrives at his grandmothers house with awkward questions about the past meanwhile a generation later the israeli security barrier is going up
4505777 if you want courses to be approved in private education so your students are qualified to attend uc institutions you must teach from a secular point of view
4505778 and what did they teach in these science classes at calvary chapel christian school in murrieta one of the schools that sued
4505779 we believe that ucs discrimination is clearly unconstitutional and violates the first amendment because uc is attempting to secularize christian schools
4505780 the uc is intent upon defending some right to discriminate unlawfully
4505781 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
4505782 people used to say about natalie but she doesnt swim fast enough
4505783 certainly theres an aspect of water polo where swimming is important and speed can come into play but its also about understanding the game and positioning
4505784 in water polo in our country i believe we put too much emphasis on the swimming in water polo 60 to 70 of the game is played vertically youre only horizontal or swimming about 30 of the time
4505785 sometimes i joke that im still learning how to swim i used to have like an anchor attached to my leg but im faster now
4505786 the first time i was just kind of happy to be there along for the ride filling my role
4505787 this time im a starter and i have more responsibility and i think ive grown as a player i feel like im a lot better than i was four years ago
4505788 i think this is the first tournament in my entire life where ive actually been totally confident its been a lot of fun playing and competing
4505789 its the opportunity its the fact that im standing here right now i just got to play in that arena in front of all those people waving flags my family gets to travel my brother gets to come watch his older sister play in the olympics thats the cool thing the things you can talk about when youre older the things you can give to your kids when youre older
4505790 the game before that he looked like david bowie the game before that he looked like ronald mcdonald
4505791 we came in here with high expectations of ourselves it was too soon to end it felt like there was a knife in my heart
4505792 weve been together for two years who knows where our program goes from here
4505793 it has been a wonderful nine years for me my family and the program
4505794 there has been development of the team and the program in canada
4505795 i hoped my team would finish with a good performance and a win in my last game we seemed to run out of gas early in the second half we kept fighting and we created a war but we couldnt play the good performances we have played before they worked hard as they can i have no problem with the results
4505796 but to lose the quarter finals in the olympics its a little hard to accept right now
4505797 scott is one weve been trying to get in for a while

4505815 every time i meet with the women of panjshir i leave with two very distinct feelings

4505817 these women all have great ideas about what can be done to make their villages better
4505818 for instance they talk about the need for power drinking water and schools
4505819 the women talk about wanting to learn skills that will help generate money for their families and villages

4505842 and the nice thing about these jobs is they are green collar jobs the types of stable middle class jobs that we havent had in the bay area for a number of years now we have low paid service jobs or highly paid white collar jobs
4505843 you wont find a lot of people who can do that because i did the installation myself and i took advantage of the best local rebate system in the state

4505900 holy shit what the fuck do i do now i dont even know this guy
4505901 thanks and you are to address me as hokage sama baka
4505902 ok sasuke i know the guy insulted you by calling the uchihas a bunch of copycat losers but that still didnt give you any reason to set the guys head on fire
4505903 well he shouldnt have made the dangerous mistake of crossing me
4505904 yeah and i like to put on dresses and sing i feel pretty at nights
4505905 you two are acting like children i expected it from naruto but sasuke even takashi whos 7 and haruhi whos 6 act more mature than you two

4505916 they didnt carry any avalanche transceivers or probes and they didnt have a shovel each as far as im aware
4505917 travelling in the mountains in winter carrying that should be mandatory they would have been able to dig each other out in an avalanche for us it didnt seem like they had a lot
4505918 they rented a couple of pairs of plastic climbing boots and some harnesses they seemed to have the basics like packs and clothing they were really well set up with that
4505919 over the whole area the avalanche risk is high to extreme
4505920 its a technical climb the easiest way to do it is straight forward in good conditions but theres always the danger of avalanches
4505921 from the top you can see the beach on the west coast so you bear the full brunt of any frontal system that comes through the winds are just huge and there are regular avalanches
4505922 a key part of the rudd governments plan to address the challenges faced in the murray darling basin is making the water market more efficient so water can move to where it brings the most benefits
4505923 some irrigation infrastructure operators impose high termination fees on farmers who elect to sell their water and terminate water delivery rights
4505924 high termination fees prevent farmers from realising the market value of their water entitlements and deter trade in water
4505925 any of these issues of restricting the trade means that there isnt a full trading opportunity across the states
4505926 when they signed up to the national water initiative governments talked about the need for open trade
4505927 things like these fees are an impediment to that trade
4505928 theres third party impact as a result of water trade
4505929 theres impact on those who wish to remain as irrigators and also on the communities that in many cases have been built on irrigated agriculture
4505930 we suspect in nsw there are above 400 infrastructure operators
4505931 that goes down to a handful of farmers on a shared channel they might only have one pump and five farms but they are an infrastructure operator theyve got shared costs between them so if one farmer decides to move out then potentially the costs are all raised to an extent that the other farms are all no longer viable
4505932 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre
4505933 australia has one of the safest aviation systems in the world
4505934 i think that quite clearly qantas themselves regret any disruption that occurs but it is important to put this in perspective
4505935 if everyone panics from day one the price will go down
4505936 if youre a little more patient there could be some upside
4505937 we understand that many of our unit holders are relying on these distribution payments in what has been a challenging year

4505940 i dug so deep in the last 50 metres i couldnt breathe
4505941 i gave everything i had i couldnt give any more
4505942 i just wanted to give it my all and to be hurting at the end of it
4505943 i dont want to complain said american natalie coughlin third behind steffen and trickett in the 100 metres
4505944 im sure my competitors are very tired too its not just the race its the press conferences the drug testing the rub downs a lot goes into every race
4505945 it is taxing mentally and physically and i think you are seeing that in the water
4505946 we used pikmin as inspiration of course but also as games such as sacrifice games that involved a central character who controls hordes of followers
4505947 however i feel our core mechanics and setting are substantially different and the games differ much more than typical shooters strategy titles so i say anyone claiming overlord is a pikmin clone needs to get their head checked
4505948 in how you play it you point and the minions go and break and kill things its a very literal connection for the player
4505949 obviously weve twisted the fairy tale stuff around because it wouldnt be an overlord game without a load of black humor so instead of helping little red riding hood find her grandma youd be helping the wolf shop for granny friendly sauces thats not actually in the game but you get the idea
4505950 i didnt want to see him not do himself justice
4505951 hes been a wonderful player a great player i was pleased for him tonight that he showed he could play in the nrl again thats the only pleasure i took
4505952 at this time of year when you lead 12 0 when youre trying to get to what were trying to achieve it cant happen
4505953 why didnt you speak up and say look even though its not my call we are about to implement the largest recall in the history of the western world unlawfully because we are going to deny the company its statutory requirement to natural justice why didnt you say that
4505954 you werent prepared to recall this product back then but that was the reason you were going to call the other 6000 products back in 2003
4505955 i dont have a particular recollection as to what happened with this product
4505956 but youve just told me that you were concerned that this product was still out in the community
4505957 you didnt take any steps to have it recalled i just find that quite unbelievable
4505958 better off overall than had we recommended a freeze in the tariff
4505959 our clear recommendation is that this should be all that is required
4505960 an australian car industry that is greener more responsive to the demands of the market employs more people and exports more
4505961 i say to everyone loud and clear that we are long term believers in industry in australia long term believers in industry policy in australia long term believers in manufacturing in australia long term believers in the automobile industry in australia
4505962 in the time between mr bracks finalising this report and it being made public today the doha round of trade talks has collapsed
4505963 that changes one of the key assumptions in this report and we think the government should rethink and adopt a phased or staged approach to tariff reductions

4505969 viele staatsbedienstete haben mit einer berufsunf higkeitsversicherung vorgesorgt um ihre versorgungsl cke zu schlie en
4505970 das problem ist allerdings dass vielen dieser bestehenden vertr ge eine dienstunf higkeitsklausel fehlt in der praxis kann das bedeuten dass beispielsweise ein lehrer wegen dienstunf higkeit in den ruhestand versetzt wird er damit aber noch lange nicht auch als berufsunf hig gilt und seine versicherung daher nicht greift
4505971 die meisten versicherer bieten auf grund des hohen risikos der dienstunf higkeit rund zwei drittel aller lehrer werden vorzeitig dienstunf hig in den ruhestand geschickt diesen versicherungsschutz gar nicht mehr an oder nur in einer abgeschw chten form nur rund zehn gesellschaften am deutschen markt offerieren berhaupt eine dienstunf higkeitsklausel f r beamte wer einen wirklich passenden versicherungsschutz sucht sollte sich an einen experten auf dem gebiet wenden denn f r verwaltungsbeamte lehrer polizisten oder zum beispiel vollzugsbeamte gibt es jeweils nur einige wenige unterschiedliche gesellschaften die einen m glichst optimalen schutz anbieten
4505972 this union of the mother with the son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of christs virginal conception up to his death
4505973 we also see mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the spirit who had already overshadowed her in the annunciation
4505974 finally the immaculate virgin preserved free from all stain of original sin when the course of her earthly life was finished was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory and exalted by the lord as queen over all things so that she might be the more fully conformed to her son the lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death
4505975 in a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience faith hope and burning charity in the saviors work of restoring supernatural life to souls
4505976 this motherhood of mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation therefore the blessed virgin is invoked in the church under the titles of advocate helper benefactress and mediatrix
4505977 marys function as mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of christ but rather shows its power but the blessed virgins salutary influence on men flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of christ rests on his mediation depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it
4505978 no creature could ever be counted along with the incarnate word and redeemer but just as the priesthood of christ is shared in various ways both by his ministers and the faithful and as the one goodness of god is radiated in different ways among his creatures so also the unique mediation of the redeemer does not exclude but rather gives rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one source
4505979 the churchs devotion to the blessed virgin is intrinsic to christian worship
4505980 the blessed virgin with special devotion from the most ancient times the blessed virgin has been honored with the title of mother of god to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs this very special devotion differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incarnate word and equally to the father and the holy spirit and greatly fosters this adoration
4505981 in the glory of the most holy and undivided trinity
4505982 future computing platforms are likely to be even more web centric and it organizations would do well to consider
4505983 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4505984 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4505985 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4505986 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4505987 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4505988 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4505989 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4505990 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4505991 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4505992 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4505993 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4505994 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4505995 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4505996 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4505997 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4505998 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4505999 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4506000 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4506001 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4506002 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4506003 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4506004 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4506005 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4506006 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4506007 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4506008 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4506009 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4506010 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4506011 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4506012 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4506013 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4506014 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4506015 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4506016 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4506017 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4506018 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4506019 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4506020 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4506021 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4506022 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4506023 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4506024 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4506025 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4506026 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4506027 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4506028 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4506029 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4506030 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4506031 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4506032 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4506033 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4506034 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4506035 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4506036 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4506037 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4506038 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4506039 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4506040 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4506041 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4506042 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4506043 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4506044 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4506045 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4506046 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4506047 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4506048 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4506049 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4506050 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4506051 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4506052 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4506053 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4506054 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4506055 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4506056 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4506057 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4506058 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4506059 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4506060 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4506061 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4506062 who are open to doing something on the production side
4506063 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4506064 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4506065 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4506066 leider ging es mir einige tage nicht besonders gut und ich habe mich heute sehr schwach gef hlt es hat mich sogar schon einige energie gekostet berhaupt die handschuhe anzuziehen
4506067 mit etwas m digkeit komme ich noch klar aber heute nachmittag konnte ich nur einige runden fahren bevor ich magen kr mpfe bekam
4506068 das hilft meiner crew nicht besonders weil ich nicht in der lage war viele runden am st ck zusammen zu bringen und der morgen war f r uns auch nicht besonders gut
4506069 wir hatten schwierigkeiten das richtige setup f r den neuen streckenbelag zu finden vom blo en anblick her k nnte man meinen dass der asphalt sich sanft zu den r dern verhalten w rde aber er ist sehr aggressiv besonders das vorderrad wird sehr in mitleidenschaft gezogen heute nachmittag waren wir mit einer h rteren komponente an der vorderachse unterwegs ungef hr das was wir am sachsenring und in laguna verwendet hatten um den vorderen reifen optimal zu nutzen
4506070 die jungs haben das bike stetig verbessert jedes mal wenn ich herein kam es ist daher sehr frustrierend keinen longrun abgeliefert haben zu k nnen wir haben noch viel arbeit vor uns ich hoffe dass ich mich morgen besser f hle und dass das wetter besser wird
4506071 wir haben heute morgen gut angefangen und einige anst ndige rundenzeiten erzielt am nachmittag haben wir mit dem setup aber nicht die fortschritte gemacht wie die anderen fahrer und so haben wir boden verloren
4506072 die maschine ist sehr unruhig besonders hinten das ist noch ein gebiet auf das wir uns konzentrieren m ssen der neue belag hat die strecke verbessert obwohl es hier und da noch ein paar buckel gibt
4506073 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4506074 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4506075 epic is excited to work with ea partners to launch our next big ip on the global stage ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs

4506077 mr gallo what would you like to say about your wines
4506078 when you get a short guy make him shorter when you get a tall guy make him taller
4506079 there is only one kind of rfp to which i will respond one i helped write
4506080 major league soccers average attendance is at its highest level since 1996 the leagues very first season and the league wide attendance average itself rivals the league wide average of the most recent seasons of both the nba and nhl all three leagues now average between 16 000 and 17 500 nationwide
4506081 watch them compete because you never know who might strip down to beachwear
4506082 why not note their novelty instead of writing a post of how un pc they are theyre working
4506083 i struck up a spirited debate about national politics the clients took an unabashed mccain point of view and threw in a good dose of hillary bashing that was before we got into universal health coverage energy policy and the death penalty
4506084 the quickest way to go out of business is to advertise a bad product
4506085 the tight lending markets that likely would make it difficult to arrange bank financing
4506086 it had assembled a team of senior executives and advisers to study the possibility of acquiring borders
4506087 he always puts my toothbrush back in the holder without saying anything
4506088 capital punishment may help break this no end in sight cycle of terror put the terrorists on notice and create a form of deterrence
4506089 the annals of advertising are rife with stories of brilliant creative work that the client rejected
4506090 but in branding that ability is not really a success if another target is not also reached the internal target
4506091 but when i was a teenager i didnt let my mom pick out my clothes she just didnt get it
4506092 i worry that working in an advertising public relations agency isnt appealing to young people anymore
4506093 i have long believed that having the right clients and doing the right kind of work for those clients determines an agencys ability to
4506094 all you have to do is invest a small amount of time in something brilliant
4506095 just come up with something brilliant as quick as you can and give it away
4506096 more and more i have come to the conclusion that a principle isnt a principle until it costs you money
4506097 think like a venture capitalist and change the marketing model
4506098 so what if i want to take part of a tuesday off as long as the work gets done well it shouldnt matter
4506099 it doesnt matter what it is the word job is still there and dreams are shattered every day
4506100 because of the closing of horse slaughtering facilities and cost related factors there has been an increase in unwanted horses pretty much all over the united states
4506101 recently a southwest missouri farmer went to a sale barn to collect a horse and when he went to load his trailer was full someone stuck horses in there that they didnt want
4506102 it is clear that people are becoming desperate this topic is very important for everyone to be aware of
4506103 our hearts and prayers go out to the fordham family and their friends
4506104 chancellor fordham was one of this universitys greatest leaders when i earned my undergraduate degree in chemistry his signature appeared on my diploma
4506105 as a graduating senior i couldnt appreciate the challenges he faced as chancellor
4506106 today i know that for him it was a labor of love and that we all are so fortunate to continue benefitting from his wisdom and decisive action chancellor fordham is rightly regarded as the driving force behind a period of extraordinary success at carolina we will never forget his deep love for this place
4506107 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to
4506108 how could somebody do that how could you forget your son inside a truck

4506141 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4506142 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4506143 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4506144 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4506145 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4506146 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4506147 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4506148 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4506153 the concern was if the people of this diocese knew that father paquette and other priests were molesting boys and that bishop marshall was covering it up people would leave the diocese in droves would they not
4506154 our thinking is that knowing the awareness of others concerning his problem father paquette will have reason for self control
4506155 in view of your statement that father paquette will benefit only minimally from therapeutic intervention do you think that the danger of scandal is already too risky
4506156 the bottom line is the evidence doesnt support a simple assault
4506157 we defer to the prosecutor and we have every confidence that he will take the best and most appropriate course
4506158 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4506161 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4506162 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4506163 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4506164 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4506165 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4506166 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4506167 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4506168 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4506169 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4506170 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4506171 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4506172 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4506174 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4506175 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4506176 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4506179 si usted fracasa fracasamos todos los ind genas del mundo
4506180 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4506181 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4506182 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4506183 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4506184 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4506185 i knew with ucs organizations that we had to have a robotics group so i looked on the web
4506186 he has to be one of the warmest guys ive ever talked to
4506187 he told me all about the team and all the great things they do
4506188 this is so great that you all would come and do this for us
4506189 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4506190 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4506191 whats interesting here is that contrary to popular belief its not just the weight of the backpack but how its carried
4506192 and the pain generated is not just on the back it includes the pressure on the skin which causes nerve pain similar to that tingling sensation caused when a leg or arm falls asleep
4506193 its possible that our subjects alter their posture by elevating the right shoulder thus increasing the contact pressure on that shoulder
4506194 if those postures are practiced over a long period of time with more weight and pressure on one shoulder it may alter posture and produce prolonged pain we need to study this further
4506195 following these recommendations may require conscious effort from the kids encouragement from parents peers and school staff until it becomes habitual
4506196 although professionals and parents cannot often dictate what children should carry it is important for us to educate them so they carry the packs correctly
4506197 parents also need to check what their children are carrying we found that quite often its not just books and school work thats weighing them down but ipods and laptop computers and other things they may not need to carry to school everyday
4506198 das ist durchaus besser als zu jahresanfang aber noch ist es zu fr h um von einer trendwende zu sprechen

4506205 ours has been an unprecedented effort to focus attention on the central role that the courts play in foster care
4506206 we have an absolute obligation to do right by the children and families who come into our court rooms with these recommendations we propose changing the way that juvenile dependency courts do business and we identify the ways in which courts and agencies can more effectively collaborate to meet the needs of foster children and their families
4506207 court system that lacks sufficient tools information and accountability necessary to move children swiftly out of foster care and into their homes
4506208 while other states have set up similar commissions or task forces none has been as broad based in composition comprehensive in scope or as high profile moreover none has the potential to influence as many children given the size of californias child population
4506209 we have set up scores of watch towers and have cameras placed in open areas crossroads and major entrances

4506220 these kids are using the same muscles over and over again and theres not enough down time theres more and more of a push to get in as many games as possible at as many facilities as possible and you lose sight of what is happening to the athlete
4506221 its estimated that about 3 million kids under age 15 are injured every year in playing youth sports
4506222 were losing the concept of what youth sports are about it should be about fun
4506223 perhaps the most significant original programming ever developed by a broadcast network specifically for the web
4506224 we wanted to be sensitive to the current viewer behavior and not put a traditional 22 minutes out there in a sense were letting the story dictate where the breaks are
4506225 a nice philosophical discussion which is impossible you assume that the state read parties politicians would willingly relinquish what power it has obtained through various means to date that for me is the same as assuming that a bureaucracy created to accomplish a particular goal would willingly dismantle once the goal is achieved

4506233 everyone was on their feet they thought it was an amazing moment and weve heard from the presenters that they dont see reactions like that in china with three standing ovations so it definitely was a triumph
4506234 to be on the olympic grounds and to be in a city with that much energy and excitement was really special
4506235 a lot of them saw the main sights like tiananmen square the forbidden city the temple of heaven some of these things were in walking distance of the hotel
4506236 we had a childrens choir from beijing that sand a medley of peace songs it was a beautiful event children singing the pops performing this american chinese handshake between the two cultures

4506243 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4506244 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4506245 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4506246 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4506247 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4506248 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us

4506251 it is important for the boys to go into the match with a lot of seriousness and business like approach and avoid the little mistakes that can cost a team dearly at a stage like this on the whole i have immense confidence in the team and with the prayer of all nigerians we should be singing victory song once again on saturday evening
4506252 at this stage l have told the boys to be focused they have to be focused and must avoid any mistake at the back the team must make less mistakes at the defence or else we are out
4506253 they are leaving their old life style for a new life as ordained knights and must eschew all ungodly tenets

4506255 we deeply appreciate your compliment and campaign against this situation that we are both committed to fighting we will like to extend our appreciation towards your profound intellectual ability in going beyond the curriculum of the school by introducing it in your programme on mid wifery because we realise that it is very important at this critical time of cases of maternal mortality in order to curtail such problems in the state
4506256 we are not going to live any stone unturned in ensuring that we contribute our allahs given talent to reduce such cases of death during pregnancy we absolutely know that allah swt is the one who gives and takes away life also he is the one that has blessed us with a remedy in such cases we must pray to him and also to test the abilities he has given us because certainly we will be asked about what we used such talents for in the hereafter so we would respond in this campaign

4506264 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4506265 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4506266 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4506267 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4506268 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4506269 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4506301 we told the national assembly please dont ever put the budgeting benchmark as part of the appropriation law it is just an assumption if you would say gdp inflation rate these are assumptions and they have always agreed with us if you check the appropriation law you find that benchmark is not part of it who makes them are they inflexible if you gdp is 9 per cent supposing it is 11 you will fold up the country if you say benchmark 59 supposing it is 80 these are assumptions and issues that must be changed if this country will move forward

4506570 has reported clear changes in breathing rate on a conference last year with breathing rate being higher during pleasant music
4506571 duration of the effect is not certain from seconds to minutes

4506584 calls into question what role russia intends to play in international politics
4506585 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4506586 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4506587 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4506588 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4506589 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4506590 the democratic party has revitalized itself theyve done a brilliant job in my opinion in coming back
4506591 henrys outstanding transaction track record leadership experience and unparalleled contacts in the region will be invaluable to the firm as we continue to build an international platform for growth

4506593 andrews 10 years in the study and teaching of mathematics and statistics is a great asset to our research department and is a wonderful compliment to the fundamental nature of our strategy
4506594 mr vizarra will focus on both the enhancement of our current strategy and the exploration of universe expansion
4506595 scientists think about all the time about the meaning of their work about the purpose of life about the purpose of their own lives i certainly do but these questions as important as they are are not scientific questions
4506596 if i could solve the question of the meaning of my life by doing an experiment in the laboratory i assure you i would rush off and do it right now but these questions simply lie outside the purview of science it doesnt say theyre not important it doesnt say that any answer is necessarily wrong but it does say that science cannot address it its a reflection of the limitation of science
4506597 this bleak view is actually at variance with what we know about the nature of our universe and the nature of evolutionary change

4506600 wherever the russians are there is trouble continuous russia propaganda is rolling this is unprovoked brutal attack on georgia georgia is not a failed state we screamed to the world that russia was going to do this we will never surrender we will never give up our freedom i thought the former kgb was gone i was wrong we are under russian occupation now there is only one sovereignty in georgia there is no compromise on territories we need negotiating solutions all of this could have been prevented russian capable of doing much worse than i imagined these are 21st century barbarians russia has been testing the west everything nice and new makes russians sick
4506601 a cease fire accord is ordering all russian troops to leave immediately we need international observers on the scene fast to help georgia maintain its independence the free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications we have to begin discussion of consequences facing russia discussion of russias international role will be ongoing
4506602 haz lo que yo digo pero no lo que yo hago
4506603 al final creo que todos fueron rechazados por falta de fondos
4506604 yo dir a que en un mes el proyecto se tratar en el senado
4506605 deber contar con una poblaci n no menor a 60 mil habitantes si se encuentra localizado en le conurbano o el gran la plata y no menor a 10 mil habitantes si encuentra en el resto de la provincia
4506606 si todos los indicadores econ micos y sociales son importantes
4506607 poner nfasis no s lo en el municipio que se crea sino tambi n en el residual
4506608 no hay decisi n de la provincia para dar la divisi n que los distritos han solicitado
4506609 es importante para nosotros la presencia de la senadora del pro viviana arcidi cono ya que es una legisladora que por pertenecer a la tercera secci n conoce las problem ticas de nuestros distritos
4506610 en caso de que no haya respuestas y de que no se d celeridad al tratamiento de los proyectos presentados volveremos a los cortes de ruta
4506611 con el conflicto del campo que mantuvo expectante a toda la sociedad no era prudente salir a las rutas pero ahora hay un nuevo contexto
4506612 desde que asumi daniel scioli no da un paso para adelante si no pide permiso los reclamos est n siempre presentes en abril antes del problema del campo se hab a hablado de hacer un acto en cada pueblo todos al mismo tiempo el mismo d a con el tema del agro hubo un parate en esto pero estamos convencidos que buenos aires no puede tener 134 distritos son muy pocos

4506620 im going to ask them about abortion i am going to ask them about the definition of marriage
4506621 i intend to ask the tough questions but i am going to ask them in a civil way
4506622 im certainly going to ask a question about jesus christ in this forum
4506623 personal faith is your worldview and that determines how you will lead
4506624 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4506625 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4506626 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4506627 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4506628 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4506629 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry

4506633 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4506634 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4506635 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
4506636 these layoffs will affect several departments and will be completed by wednesday aug 20
4506637 a severance package will be provided to employees whose jobs are being eliminated
4506638 there are no plans for any further reductions at this time
4506639 i do wish i could say with certainty that this will be the final action needed to address the economic slump however we will continue to manage our expenses in line with revenue
4506640 i realize these payroll reductions are significant and will be difficult as we see fellow employees and friends who have worked hard alongside us impacted by this decision
4506641 we recognize we will lose dedicated employees who have helped us to past success and that will be tough on us all
4506642 stated simply kraken infected systems worldwide start to connect to a server we control
4506643 we listened and collected statistics for a week and filtered out for the ip addresses and then the systems
4506644 from our point of view if someone doesnt do something about bots theyll just continue on and on
4506645 if you have the opportunity to do something take it
4506646 cleansing the systems would probably help 99 of the infected user base
4506647 its just the 1 of corner cases that scares me from a corporate liability standpoint
4506648 its not our property and its not up to us
4506649 i dont know i wouldnt know the answer to that
4506650 i think most people have the same opinion as amini and i do
4506651 you have to reduce the number of bots out there whether thats infiltration or by the operating system or at the isp something needs to be done
4506652 cleaning the bots would be opening up a pretty large can of worms
4506653 clean them if you dont a rival bot net owner will
4506654 you not only face a moral dilemma but updating a computer without authorization is illegal in the u s
4506655 i fall on the side of proactive patching but there is more than just the moral decision to decide upon before taking action
4506656 the development of automated scripts exploiting keys looks like a real threat to ssh servers around the world
4506657 theres a lot of different areas that youre going to have to look not just within debian
4506658 administrators will have to audit every single key even systems that do not use the debian software need to be audited in case any key is being used that was created on a debian system
4506659 im the dns guy in the black hat community so if im saying its bad then its bad it didnt occur to me that people would question it
4506660 my concern the entire time was that the public would panic so i was thinking how do we get an orderly patch when this has never happened before
4506661 i needed the vendors behind me and the dns community and i had that in spades
4506662 saying it here first doubting theres really any meat to this dns security announcement
4506663 i broke a huge rule i didnt bring in anyone else from the research community
4506664 i forgot that no you dont get to make a whole bunch of noise without some technical details to back it up
4506665 as security researchers we need the ability to call bullshit on people
4506666 dan explained the full details and scope of his attack and both of us were impressed and agreed that it is way more serious than we had imagined
4506667 when the full details of dans attack come out you will most likely be impressed i definitely was
4506668 but peer review is important if theres not full disclosure there has to be at least peer review i agree with the skeptical reaction if it happened again i would never do it this way id still try to delay disclosure but id bring in other voices
4506669 i think dan should come clean on this and publish the details
4506670 the 30 days hes given before black hat wont make much of a difference but his reason for not doing it is at least plausible and he did the work so its his call
4506671 every day someone doesnt find an exploit helps im just trying to buy time for my buddies in corporations because i know if you screw up dns the net goes down
4506672 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
4506673 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4506674 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4506675 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy

4506679 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
4506680 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4506681 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4506682 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4506683 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4506684 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4506685 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4506686 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4506687 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4506688 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4506689 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4506690 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4506691 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4506692 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4506693 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
4506694 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
4506695 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
4506696 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4506697 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4506698 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4506699 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4506700 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4506701 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4506702 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4506703 what do you want your look to say to people
4506704 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4506705 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4506706 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4506707 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4506708 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4506709 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

4506713 every month that goes by without tax reform america is a relatively less attractive place to do business over the past 18 months nine of the 30 most developed nations and 20 countries world wide from israel to germany to turkey have cut their corporate tax rates nations are slashing rates to attract capital and jobs from the u s and the tragedy is that our politicians keep making it easy for them
4506714 corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes
4506715 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
4506716 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
4506717 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4506718 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4506719 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4506720 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4506721 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4506722 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4506723 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4506724 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4506725 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4506726 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4506727 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4506728 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4506729 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4506730 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4506731 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4506732 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4506733 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4506734 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4506735 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4506736 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4506737 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4506738 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4506739 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4506740 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4506741 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4506742 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4506743 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4506744 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4506745 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4506746 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4506747 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4506748 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4506749 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4506750 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4506761 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4506762 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4506763 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4506764 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4506765 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4506766 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4506767 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4506768 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4506769 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

4506773 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4506774 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4506775 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4506776 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

4506779 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping

4506783 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4506784 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4506785 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

4506787 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4506790 so what we did there was like 30 or 40 of us we actually lifted that bus off of her and pulled her from under the bus
4506791 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4506793 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4506794 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4506795 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4506796 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different the most important thing is the actions during the game
4506797 when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful

4506801 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4506802 usually the teams which comes up give you a good game and it is our target to win the first game
4506803 i expect he will fit well into our collective game and that he expresses a good attitude is very ambitious and fights very hard for the team
4506804 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient

4506807 what we have here is the latest lawyer led attempt to strip judicial selection from future presidents
4506808 according to the proposal future federal judges would be selected not by an elected president but with the aid of home state senators and a bipartisan commission that would provide a list of recommended nominees for judicial vacancies the white house would then select a candidate from the preapproved list the commission would be created by the two senators from each state to offer up consensus choices for federal nominees
4506809 w e now have an advisory guidelines regime where as reflected by this case any officer or director of virtually any public corporation who has committed securities fraud will be confronted with a guidelines calculation either calling for or approaching lifetime imprisonment while i acknowledge that the guidelines reflect congresss judgment as to the appropriate national policy for such crimes this does not mean that the sentencing guidelines for white collar crimes should be a black stain on common sense

4506814 although the types of tech writing that i do require me to spend the majority of my time on windows pcs and some on linux systems i also use a macbook and have accumulated a list of windows vs
4506815 potential switchers need to realize that mac os x although similar in some respects to windows works differently
4506816 at an operational level however mac os x is very different from its windows counterpart not only does it look different but it also operates and is architected differently these key operational differences directly filter down to how the two operating systems interact with the user many first time mac users complain that it feels foreign and unnatural because they dont know how to accomplish tasks or use an application this is simply a byproduct of having used windows for so many years new mac users will have to go through a learning curve theres no way around this fact
4506817 after more than 20 years of being a pc user including all versions of windows and ms dos before that i switched over to a macbook pro last october
4506818 here are some of the software and operating system challenges i experienced as well as how they were resolved hopefully some of this might be helpful to those who have recently made the switch or are considering it

4506961 mais je ne veux pas fuir mes responsabilit s je voudrais que soit privil gi le dialogue au chevet du malade entre lui m me le m decin et la famille en toute humanit afin que soit trouv e la solution la plus adapt e chaque situation
4506962 des pr l vements ont t effectu s jeudi et des analyses sont ordonn es les r sultats sont attendus dans plusieurs jours

4506964 ele conta que o sexto filme vai a lan amento no mesmo per odo que

4506968 clearly it would be helpful and self protective if a person who has a high risk sexual life style could at least modify it to make it less risky
4506969 its not a revenue issue because weve already sold the ticket but the biggest thing to me is an atmosphere issue for the athletes and the other people in the venue
4506970 we have a responsibility to put some work into facilitating that process
4506971 weve got a few sort of steps in our planning but the first is to minimize the size of the sections for olympic family to really as small as it needs to be for those different groups to be able to do their jobs
4506972 those sections need to be big enough for them to do their jobs but no bigger
4506973 everybodys objectives are to have full venues its more fun for everybody and the atmosphere is better for everyone
4506974 so i think its just a matter of being proactive leading up to the games and just communicating with people well and having a place where they know who to contact and we have the ability to make changes quickly
4506975 hopefully we can set some trends make sure early we can intercept people who arent showing up find out if theres a reason and hopefully find a solution
4506976 i have been living outside for 17 years so its going to be hard to live inside

4506982 we thank everyone for supporting us but we want things to remain calm because violence leads to nothing
4506983 the riots were not something my family and i wanted we never wanted violence
4506984 was it really necessary a little boy who as just starting out his life id like to be in his place ive lived longer than him
4506985 trust big word eh what can i say as a family what we want is for police to be impartial and that it doesnt take centuries to find answers on the death of my brother
4506986 i think it would have been fair if al gore had won
4506987 i personally think its a joke if people feel that our votes are truly counted
4506988 no no thats too hard well call you margaret from now on
4506989 im sorry mr ouye we tried everything we could to save your eye
4506990 im proud to live to be 87 and able to vote in an election where there is both a young black man and a woman who are running to become the president of the united states
4506991 queremos casarnos hace tiempo queremos que nuestra relaci n sea legal y estamos muy muy ansiosas
4506992 creo que un d a la gente la considerar como la prohibici n de votar para las mujeres las leyes de segregaci n racial o como algo rid culo que no se nos den a todos los mismos derechos

4506995 en el referendo del 10 de agosto m s de dos tercios del pa s manifestaron su apoyo al proceso de cambio liderado por el presidente evo morales

4506997 if you are planning to attend this class this is going to be a very hard one if you dont want to work hard perhaps you should take home economics
4506998 the possibilities were so narrow for women in those days
4506999 many women think that they dont matter and that their vote doesnt count
4507000 its important to see somebody that looks like you a woman
4507001 you have your life ahead of you you can make the difference and help us create a new generation of leaders you are one of many not the only one
4507002 theres a 100 ways to tell youre a japanese american one of them is that camp doesnt refer to summer camp

4507021 look at them now theyre in a division we were in seven or eight years ago and we dont want to go back to that
4507022 i had a meeting with all the players this week and the contents will remain private

4507029 se cumple la promesa hecha por la presidenta de la comunidad de madrid esperanza aguirre al presidente de liberia ellen johnson sirleaf durante la visita que hizo a espa a el pasado a o
4507030 es un gesto significativo del pueblo espa ol hacia una liberia destruida por la guerra
4507031 no tengo ninguna duda de que seremos competitivos en cualquier campo aun sabiendo que estamos en el inicio y que hay cosas a mejorar
4507032 el partido de la previa de la champions por ejemplo es complicado y mentiroso yo le doy valor porque s lo dif cil que es y adem s a n no nos hemos clasificado a n debemos viajar a polonia
4507033 prioritario de rendir bien en la vuelta de la champions y de empezar bien la liga
4507034 con la m xima seriedad ante un rival de prestigio internacional porque en el bar a no hay partidos amistosos o menos importantes
4507035 si piensa en el club y en la instituci n no se equivocar
4507036 s que en este club tranquilidad poca y no puedo pretender que la haya porque siempre se generan muchas noticias
4507037 hizo cosas extraordinarias que ojal pudi ramos igualar simplemente son ciclos que se acaban y entre todos nos vamos adaptando
4507038 que nos responder n a la perfecci n si es necesario
4507039 si tiene que venir alg n jugador m s bien y si no tengo mucha fe en los jugadores del filial porque creo que con esta plantilla podremos llegar lejos
4507040 de momento me han ayudado mucho me han ayudado a hacerlo todo m s sencillo en principio ser n jugadores del filial pero cada caso hay que analizarlo individualmente

4507047 we found that although there is fraud in the system it doesnt take place at the polling place
4507048 my experience is that in person voter fraud is nonexistent
4507049 it doesnt happen and if you really analyze it it makes no sense because whos going to take the risk of going to jail on something so blatant that maybe changes one vote
4507050 elections dont sneak up on any of us there is an opportunity to start that process if need be several weeks or months before the election
4507051 state and federal lawmakers must be ready to reject laws like indianas and ensure that the rights of voters prevails

4507058 we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference pdc on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4507059 about two years ago i watched mary kate smoke a marijuana joint and pass it on to friends when they were all at a party together
4507060 then there were her friends who definitely did drugs i especially remember three hangers on two guys and a girl i would call them drug dealers
4507061 i saw them with cocaine and they also tried to provide it to other people i also saw them with pures which are tablets like ecstasy
4507062 because shes so tiny a little booze would have a big effect on her
4507063 colleagues told me that on at least two occasions she had so much to drink that she had to be carried to her car
4507064 even in high school she liked to drink vodka with fruit juice or mixer mary kate would get so blasted that her sister ashley would pull her aside and tell her to stop
4507065 when she was 16 her weight dropped below 80 pounds i remember ashley telling me at the time mary kate just wont eat my family is going nuts we didnt know what to do so we put her in the hospital
4507066 wed try to get her to eat but shed only get mad and growl just leave me alone if im not hungry im not hungry
4507067 mary kate also smoked cigarettes constantly and she filled up on alcohol shed drink anything available jack daniels vodka whatever
4507068 my terms are fairly clear and established because weve done them with a number of institutions
4507069 ive set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 percent cost out of the supply chain
4507070 it means between us we have to find ways to improve our supply chain operations
4507071 despite new cooperation in the taxation area we will still be able to differentiate ourselves enough from other financial centers in future
4507072 but we are willing to collaborate with other nations when it comes to the misuse of bank secrecy laws for tax evasion

4507074 there was a relationship between ms kirkland and the 13 year old
4507075 she said that there is a girl thats accusing her of things she didnt do
4507076 if a girl doesnt like another girl then they can do outrageous things to hurt the other person you cant automatically assume that what you hear is always true
4507077 the market is a bit softer and there are fewer tenants looking for space
4507078 i would say that the mood is cautious people are holding back a little bit waiting to see what the rest of the year will bring
4507079 the national numbers say that the costcos and targets are doing better now than they were during the good times
4507080 the density and prosperity of our population makes us popular for retailers who are looking and want to locate in the state
4507081 also the new jersey economy is more diversified than other parts of the country so we tend to not quite hit the peaks or the valleys of the economic cycle that other parts of the country do were not seeing big increases in vacancy rates as of yet
4507082 with kids on the show who were popular had money living the cool easy life
4507083 or it could be the totally opposite side of the spectrum
4507084 where the kid is totally frustrated with his dysfunctional family and thinks that if they get on tv his parents will see how big a fool theyre making of themselves and maybe theyll change
4507085 the only two i like are man vs wild and deadliest catch watching women gossip is not my forte
4507086 i dont think id want that many people seeing my family what we go through our dysfunctionality because a lot of those are our private moments why would you want other people seeing it
4507087 i used to watch the osbournes when i was in high school
4507088 ozzy was older than hell he was still cracked out and his hands were shaking at least that was funny
4507089 we want to vote for her on the first vote
4507090 all of us worked so hard for hillary and this is history in the making
4507091 my support of hillary clinton in the primary was based on her extensive experience and her strong vision for our country
4507092 it was not a vote against barack obama i commend him on running an excellent primary campaign and laying out a vision for america that we all can embrace i will do everything i can to help elect him in november
4507093 im surprised at the flap over the roll call issue
4507094 i have expected a roll call and expect to be counted for hillary but i certainly would support barack at the time of the roll call if she asked us to it was historic for maines margaret chase smith to be nominated in 1964 and hillary certainly deserves historical recognition for her achievement in this campaign
4507095 ill be strongly in obamas corner from now through election day
4507096 it would likely be embarrassing for her since some of her former delegates have switched allegiance by now and she is intelligent enough to know that
4507097 i personally have the greatest respect for sen clinton and i want her to be greeted by the convention with the respect she deserves
4507098 i do not have a strong opinion about a roll call vote
4507099 i generally am less inclined to favor symbolic gestures hillary clinton has a great deal of substance and i trust that she will tend to focus on meaningful ways to move this country forward
4507100 i would ideally wish for all the delegates to speak in one unified voice
4507101 but i know there are many whose healing will not begin until their positions are recognized i do not want this convention to become a forum for dissent and unhappiness but rather hope and reform
4507102 she would be excellent and the union of both candidates would truly create an unbeatable ticket in november
4507103 a 170 check is not worth maine families being cold this winter if opponents of a special session to invest surplus funds into liheap are concerned with costs they should join republicans in support of saving the taxpayers over 31 000 each day a special session is held
4507104 the clerk left the business and proceeded east after the gentleman who took the liquor he fired another round on andrews avenue
4507105 i would have to ask the question what was he defending
4507106 he was in no danger there was no threat the gentleman was not coming at him or threatening him in any manner he was just simply unfortunately stealing a bottle of liquor

4507111 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4507112 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment

4507120 today was quite bad but im here to learn for the future
4507121 my goals are higher for the long jump and im hoping to do the qualification well and go to the final and hopefully do my best
4507122 when im on the track i want to focus on my own event
4507123 with this young team its healthy that they tried to score another goal
4507124 im not opposed to that i thought they did well
4507125 all year this team has been great at dealing with pressure either being down a goal or tied of having a team come back
4507126 weve always fought for 90 100 whatever it takes i like the fact that we are creating chances and having different people score goals
4507127 i hoped to see my team play as well as they have done before this tournament we didnt
4507128 we gave the u s team too much time and space to use their passing skills normally playing the u s brings out the best of us but today we looked a bit tired and didnt have the legs or gas we used to have they created more than we did
4507129 in light of the current situation in georgia and after consultation with our american allies we agreed that it would be inappropriate to go ahead with exercise vigilant eagle a planned combined norad russia military exercise that was scheduled to begin august 20 2008
4507130 we will assess participation in future such exercises as the situation evolves

4507142 incomes have never gotten back to where they were before the recession
4507143 im not claiming these results are where i would want them to be but they are all positive in fact the household results show more real improvement at the lower income levels than is found in the middle and upper middle

4507154 the mccain campaign is so out of touch instead of taking the cake to a homeless shelter or giving it volunteers they just threw it in the garbage
4507155 what a perfect metaphor for why we cant trust john mccain with our social security the campaign was literally throwing money in the trash
4507156 thats in the future i am on a path to help move kentucky forward if that avenue takes me to a different job then where i am right now well it may but today im not looking beyond what im doing right now
4507157 broken newel post kicked out porch rail cracked missing and half pried away stained glass windows were among the worst atrocities we spied

4507160 did engage in or attempt to engage in an act of sexual intercourse with angel green while she was in the care custody and control of edmonds
4507161 dress pulled up and wearing the pantyhose in a sexually explicit position
4507162 make fun of pictures we found of him in tv y novelas magazine
4507163 off set i dont spend my time staring at myself in the mirror
4507164 this gave me occasion to observe that when men are employd they are best contented for on the days they workd they were and chearful and with the consciousness of having done a good days work they spent the evenings jollily but on the idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread and in continual ill humour
4507165 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4507166 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4507167 bestaat al qaida twintig jaar wat een giller zeg het is toch niet te geloven nou van harte jongens maak er een knallend feest van gheghegheghe oh en osama mag zich trouwens ook wel een tijdje in mijn holletje verschuilen hoor gheghegheghe jongens wat zeg ik n toch weer hys t risch nee zonder dollen even het is natuurlijk gewoon een stel toppers op naar de volgende twintig en kusjes van geer
4507168 ja god ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik enige verwantschap voel met de vrijheidsstrijders van al qaida maar ik ben ongelofelijk ongelukkig met hun acties al vraag ik me af of dat 9 11 ondertussen niet is verjaard maar goed het type actie van a qaida staat haaks op de democratische weg waar ik zelf voor heb gekozen het verandert niks aan het feit dat ze aanslagen hebben gepleegd maar ik zie nu in dat je op een andere manier je politieke doelen moet bereiken of is er spijt van heb dat ik in 2001 nog juichend voor de tv zat luister ik heb dat eerder in het parool al erkend en ook naar de partij toe ben ik daar altijd heel openhartig over geweest ik vond het toen een gerechtvaardige actie maar nogmaals ik heb de les getrokken dat illegale acties niet het juiste middel zijn om je doel te bereiken als u mij vraagt of ik daar spijt van heb dan zeg ik ik heb er spijt van dat ik dat toen niet heb gezien maar vooruit genoeg over mij al qaida van harte
4507169 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4507170 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4507171 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4507172 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4507173 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4507174 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4507175 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4507176 the real haters in america are on the far left
4507177 if i scream loud enough and make enough of a scene ill get my way
4507178 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4507179 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4507180 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4507181 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4507182 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4507183 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4507184 sentiment has turned more bearish across the metals spectrum on friday after yesterdays cpi reading triggered speculation the fed may raise interest rates in order to cap inflation

4507186 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4507187 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4507188 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4507189 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4507190 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4507191 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4507192 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4507193 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4507194 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4507195 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4507196 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4507197 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4507198 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4507199 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4507200 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4507201 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4507202 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4507203 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4507204 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4507205 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4507206 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4507207 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4507208 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4507209 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4507210 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4507211 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4507212 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4507213 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4507214 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4507215 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4507216 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4507217 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4507218 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4507219 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4507220 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4507221 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4507222 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4507223 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4507224 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4507225 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4507226 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4507227 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4507228 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4507229 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4507230 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4507231 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4507232 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4507233 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4507234 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4507236 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life

4507239 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes
4507240 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is
4507241 the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties

4507250 we are going to relentlessly chase perfection knowing full well we will not catch it because nothing is perfect
4507251 are we prepared to defend ourselves from highly sophisticated cyberattacks directed at our critical infrastructure industries of course not
4507252 there are going to be no incoming forces no incoming missiles no incoming ships the attacks will emerge from our own computer systems
4507253 if we push the switch and actually start launching cyberattacks whats next
4507254 whats somebody else going to do to you i dont think our country is ready for that yet
4507255 but each time they put one up it gets discovered and then attacked again
4507256 with obscenities and pictures of hitler and things like that
4507257 but the russian government controls the places that these servers are operating from
4507258 is an isolated country if you compare them to the united states or western europe
4507259 they dont have a lot of connectivity to the outside world so they cant take all the extra traffic
4507260 there is no way to attribute any of this to being directed by the russians or the russian government
4507261 i had an experience with a yorkshire terrier that was given bacon every morning for breakfast
4507262 anything greasy fatty or salty is not good the dog would end up skipping meals waiting on the bacon
4507263 its just like with humans animals dont need them because there is no real benefit
4507264 i feel it leads to a lot of problems health and behavioral problems
4507265 one serving of bacon is like a weeks worth for them
4507266 they do what works and if it doesnt work they dont do it
4507267 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4507268 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4507269 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4507270 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4507271 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected

4507279 dead zones appear in waters worldwide new study estimates more than 400
4507280 although their volume of production is not as much as big companies the government is committed to helping smes add value to their products and boost their productivity
4507281 i must stress that for smes to develop they must be able to improve on their products and services
4507282 however such efforts need to be supported by ngos and the various chambers of commerce
4507283 i would advise them to have a closed forum and then engage those who are concerned about the issue
4507284 i have heard from some groups who worry that this discussion denigrates islam and while i do not share their view i think we should be mindful of their fears
4507285 it was our parents idea for us to get married today as it is an auspicious day
4507286 it was last week and we went for breakfast after that guess what the bill came up to rm88 we went for burgers later and the bill again came up to rm8 88
4507287 what better day to get married as this auspicious date happens only once in our lifetime we have been waiting for today for almost a year
4507288 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4507289 i would argue it is normal for dancers performers to be dressed in other races clothes
4507290 this date makes it easier for me to remember my anniversary my parents are happy i chose this date hopefully it will bring good luck to us
4507291 but a few days ago a friend of mine who is a member of the association here called to tell me about the mass wedding and asked me to join
4507292 the date is meaningful and it comes once every century
4507293 now i get to celebrate my birthday and anniversary together
4507294 entretenir le jardin du souvenir tait devenu beaucoup trop compliqu pour le personnel de maintenance ces derniers temps en raison de la multiplication des ornements floraux nous craignons que ces fleurs en plastique ne soient un jour prises dans les tondeuses gazon et que les projections de morceaux de plastique ainsi produites ne blessent quelquun
4507295 filipino refugees who worked as labourers started building huts and soon it began spreading all because the authorities did not take any stern action
4507296 if you send one back two will return this is because the first one will tell a friend or relative there is a house ready for them if they return
4507297 we bought a squatter house for rm3 000 in penampang two years ago and have stayed there ever since
4507298 its not easy living in a squatter area because we are always on alert in case the authorities come we do have proper documents but we are not supposed to be here in the first place
4507299 cable thefts illegal water usage and electricity connections criminals hiding out illegal immigrants unhygienic conditions and many more these are well known problems as far as squatter colonies are concerned
4507300 i have issued an order for the local authorities to offer full cooperation during the exercise which is spearheaded by security agencies such as the police and army
4507301 this time it will be different because we have full federal support and it will run continuously
4507302 theres something wrong with the soil as it gave way when there was no rain at all
4507303 i hope the authorities will investigate and take action before its too late
4507304 we have been staying here since 1995 and nothing as bad as this has ever happened before
4507305 we want to ensure their safety and they can only return to their homes after the problems were inspected and rectified
4507306 we will also restore the power and water supply to the houses when the units have been certified as safe again
4507307 this is all i can afford for now with the salary i get from working as a labourer
4507308 demolish these makeshift houses take action against the local landowners for erecting illegal structures and harbouring illegal immigrants and the district will have fewer illegal immigrants
4507309 it would be good if nrd and immigration officers could help us to verify the documents that would help to save time spent screening the suspects
4507310 they constantly monitored and audited all hmc activities throughout the check and reported those items which they felt needed improvement
4507311 all the problems were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before the aircraft was delivered to australia the qantas team had been very helpful to our personnel to ensure the maintenance standards of qantas were strictly observed
4507312 this is based on the fact that all these aspects were originally checked and found to be free from defect during the maintenance check and test flight with the concurrence of the qantas team
4507313 it was awful i couldnt even do the simplest household chores such as mopping or scrubbing the floor
4507314 it hurt so much that i could not bend to scrub the floor or even grip the mop
4507315 although i am feeling much better the joint pains wont go away
4507316 there are about 200 families in this area and you can say that at least one in every family has had high fever
4507317 initially we rushed him to the local hospital where he was also put on saline drips and given antibiotics
4507318 we returned home the same day and to my relief my father said he felt better
4507319 he died four days from the day he was warded the doctor did not mention the name of the fever but said it was new in the country and was carried by mosquitoes
4507320 i learnt that several open water retainers were placed in the nests for the birds to bathe and drink
4507321 sometimes i feel like its hard to breathe or even cry under the pressure but once the competition begins i will think nothing and just strive for my best
4507322 there are always four or five teams who usually compete to win such as china usa romania and russia
4507323 the others like australia italy and brazil try to get on the podium
4507324 its a great advantage to have the olympics in your country you have a lot of support which is great
4507325 as he gets older i think he will appreciate being here more and more
4507326 the longer people stay at this club you tend to not want to leave
4507327 rio ferdinand is an obvious example of that but really im just pleased we have managed to put all this real madrid stuff to bed they know what they are dealing with now
4507328 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
4507329 my husband and i were not planning for the babys arrival on this special date but we are glad she came early and it is such an easy date to remember
4507330 i happen to like the number 8 very much so my wife opted for a caesarian delivery
4507331 i am so happy with the birth of my baby girl especially since it coincides with the opening of the beijing olympics
4507332 i prayed hard to give birth on this date my son was originally scheduled for the 11th but i had a feeling he would come today
4507333 i dont really believe in auspicious numbers but if luck should come my way then its good
4507334 in fact we did not really want this date as we knew that the delivery ward would probably be full
4507335 the beijing olympics organizing committee spent several years to gather candidate songs we collected thousands of songs i felt that many songs seemed to used hand in hand the theme song of seoul olympics as a model many people including media thought that the theme song of beijing olympics should be similar to that kind of song hand in hand and many lyricists and composers followed that style finally the same was i
4507336 one day i happened to hear you and i i felt that the song was beautiful at that time the lyrics and music are simple the major purpose of our creative work was to complete an artwork on site we wanted to create a unique original unmatched and the greatest behavioral artwork in the world and we wanted to express our best wishes the lyrics of this song like you and me from one world we are one family are touching and easy to learn so other directors immediately loved this song and we felt that it fit the theme of 2008 beijing olympics harmony we recommended this song to musical professionals they all liked it
4507337 the message of this song is pure and simple when i firstly heard this song i could not believe that it was the theme song later i felt that its purity and simplicity was a good idea it is different from the grand style that we might expect but it was creative to choose this song especially when this song was performed on olympics opening ceremony the artistic conception developed from this song was very beautiful
4507338 we are very pleased with the tremendously successful launch that we had
4507339 but this is where the real journey starts for age of conan in the months ahead we will be putting a lot of effort into expanding and improving on the game and we look forward to using the games convention to unveil some of the locations content and features we have in the pipeline

4507355 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4507356 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4507357 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4507358 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4507359 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4507360 i cant believe it said liukin who finished with 63
4507361 i worked so hard for so many years for this
4507362 i saw valeris gold medal every single day when i woke up that gave me a little extra motivation i think that made a little bit of difference just to be able to see it having it there in my room knowing that in a few months i could have one of my own
4507363 looking at the next day its all around finals liukin said of their evening on thursday
4507364 were just looking at each other like can you believe it tomorrows the day we just wanted to go all out and have fun
4507365 she deserved that gold medal shes one of my best friends and the usa was standing on top of the podium we just wanted the best for each other
4507366 i probably would have told you a month ago that i was done she said
4507367 but after being here and experiencing the olympics id give anything to feel that again if i can in 2012 ill be there
4507368 im still chasing him for the medal count she said of her father who playfully reminded her that he has two olympic gold medals
4507369 he was a special person and he cared about his state
4507370 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4507371 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4507372 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4507373 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4507374 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father
4507375 he said blaine whatever you need youve got it thats the kind of man bill was he had a deep love for all of his employees and i can say we all had a deep love for him

4507377 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4507378 i know its safe but i dont want to take a chance
4507379 i prefer shopping for a home at open houses as opposed to setting appointments with my realtor to look at houses
4507380 there is less pressure to decide on a property if i see it during an open house
4507381 do i like working on sunday from 2 to 4
4507382 sustainable second generation biofuels are a pr promise not a commercial reality and are a distraction from real green transport solutions like more fuel efficient cars better public transport and safer routes for walking and cycling
4507383 more fuel efficient cars better public transport and safer routes for walking and cycling
4507384 raise the bar and define a closer measure of true sustainability in the built environment
4507385 for this tour we decided to go back to the organic roots of why we started this band it was to play with friends and see the country after being on such a light touring schedule for the last 9 months we really had time to think about where we want this band to fit this tour encapsulates our mind frame for playing music
4507386 i think bands these days think they deserve so much in my opinion were lucky to do what we do its comforting to know there are other bands who are down for the cause and willing to be part of this
4507387 it will be the first time we have performed them so they will definitely transform during the course of the tour
4507388 thats a significant amount of money for the average american family let alone a family on the verge of bankruptcy
4507389 its very possible to be too poor to be in bankruptcy because you cant afford the filing experts say
4507390 its very possible to be too poor to be in bankruptcy because you cant afford the filing
4507391 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
4507392 am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
4507393 its like youre trying to crank the car up a bit more every week
4507394 weve given up a couple long drives carolina didnt score this time pittsburgh was able to score on theirs so we just have to make sure we dont give up those long drives and get off the field bring it out and get some turnovers too
4507395 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4507396 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4507397 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4507398 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4507399 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4507400 a n teniendo en cuenta la versi n rusa de los acontecimientos de todas formas considero desproporcionada la reacci n rusa
4507401 el punto de partida debe ser la integridad territorial de georgia
4507402 no se pueden esperar 15 a os para el arreglo del conflicto
4507403 por ello es necesario cumplir urgentemente el plan de seis puntos presentado esta semana por la uni n europea ue y aceptado por mosc y tiflis a fin de que las tropas rusas salgan de georgia
4507404 hay progresos evidentes conf o en que todas las partes firmen este plan y yo con satisfacci n he o do que en opini n de la parte rusa este plan es una buena base
4507405 cada caso debe ser analizado por separado no cada pueblo que desea salirse de una uni n estatal es capaz de convertirse en un estado independiente si fuera as en el mundo habr a muchos problemas el principal postulado debe ser la integridad territorial
4507406 dijimos que georgia y ucrania ser n miembros de la otan si as lo desean este postulado se mantiene inmutable
4507407 parece que el se or presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili se cans de la diplomacia y simplemente decidi pasar a cuchillo a los osetas que le molestaban para darles un escarmiento
4507408 toda la responsabilidad de las acciones crueles e ilegales recae sobre el gobierno georgiano es necesario que la paz en la regi n sea restaurada y garantizada para que a nadie se le pasen por la cabeza ideas idiotas
4507409 rusia no quisiera un empeoramiento de las relaciones con la ue y estados unidos ya sea a corto o largo plazo
4507410 rusia aceptar cualquier decisi n que refleje inequ vocamente la voluntad de esos dos pueblos lamentablemente despu s de lo ocurrido dif cilmente osetas y abjasos podr n vivir en un mismo estado con los georgianos
4507411 nadie reniega del principio de integridad territorial como uno de los principios fundamentales del derecho internacional la cuesti n es la situaci n concreta y el pa s concreto
4507412 s lo conf an en las tropas de paz rusas
4507413 that was pretty much a drubbing really and thats not a true reflection of the two sides i think were a better side than that
4507414 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up today and it should have been a lot tighter than that were probably more used to that sort of pitch than those guys are it was a little damp in the morning but even so we should have been a little bit smarter with bat and ball
4507415 de fleste tror at kloakken er d kket af tilstandsrapporten det er den ikke rapporten d kker kun det som man kan se ledninger i v gge bygningsdele der er skjult af neds nkede lofter og kloakker uden for husets fundament er f eks ikke d kket
4507416 vi har med interesse noteret os at danva dansk vand og spildevandsforening red var ude med en anbefaling af at private stikledninger og afl bsinstallationer skal v re med i tilstandsrapporten i forbindelse med unders gelsen fra by og landskabsstyrelsen men indtil retningslinjerne bliver ndret skal husk bere selv s rge for at s lger f r foretaget en tv inspektion af kloakken
4507417 vi har brug for at erhvervslivet i langt h jere grad end i dag g r ind og er en ansvarlig spiller p forebyggelsesomr det den enkelte og vores sundhedssystem kan ikke klare forebyggelsesopgaven alene
4507418 its not so different in london either i contacted my service provider o2 about it the call dropped while we were speaking and o2 are sending me a new sim but i think the problem is more likely to be software on the iphone
4507419 das thema geld muss man eigentlich in zwei themen aufteilen 1 geld viel geld und 2 kein geld nicht genug geld wenn sie ich m chte mehr geld sagen meinen viele dass sie positiv ber geld sprechen aber wenn sie dabei angst oder unbehagen sp ren dann sprechen sie nicht ber das thema geld sondern ber das thema kein geld der unterschied ist sehr wichtig weil aussagen zum ersten thema geld anziehen aussagen zum zweiten thema aber geld fernhalten
4507420 type of problems that really should put things in perspective
4507421 ha ha life is wonderful all the time la la la
4507422 no freakin way im running 20 steps this morning i feel awful
4507423 aplaudo que el ministro santos se interese por la seguridad
4507424 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4507425 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4507426 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4507427 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4507428 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4507429 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4507430 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4507431 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4507432 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4507433 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease
4507434 dont worry the only thing youve to remember is to keep breathing
4507435 my brother in law will bring you out there and help you our in case of an emergency
4507436 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4507437 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in europe and pacific industrialised nations oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world oil demand growth the lowest since 2002
4507438 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4507439 strijdend ten onder ze was niet in de vorm van athene
4507440 op de weg wint lornah van iedereen ook dat zijn tien kilometers ze heeft niets met de baan nu al helemaal niet meer over vier jaar in londen gaat ze de marathon lopen
4507441 ik ben niet teleurgesteld ik heb mijn best gedaan de laatste twee kilometer ging het niet meer bij mij iedereen was in vorm jammer maar ik heb er vrede
4507442 muchos piensan que es una broma cuando decimos que usamos garageband pero actualmente es una herramienta incre ble
4507443 s tu puedes hacer m sica como esa en garageband pero para que lo har as hacer m sica como esa seria muy complicado he escuchado sonidos similares pero se necesita de un software de edici n mas complejo para hacerlos
4507444 a company cant just decide its going to book a loss in a division its about where the business resulting from that loss is done originally
4507445 if british taxes rates go up in comparison to elsewhere they have won and if they go down they have lost
4507446 by switching your business you are taking a view not only on which assets are going to go up and which ones are going to go down but which tax system is going to be better for you at that time
4507447 the u k is very generous when it comes to allowing companies to offset capital losses against trading income
4507448 its not a revenue issue because weve already sold the ticket but the biggest thing to me is an atmosphere issue for the athletes and the other people in the venue
4507449 we have a responsibility to put some work into facilitating that process
4507450 weve got a few sort of steps in our planning but the first is to minimize the size of the sections for olympic family to really as small as it needs to be for those different groups to be able to do their jobs
4507451 those sections need to be big enough for them to do their jobs but no bigger
4507452 everybodys objectives are to have full venues its more fun for everybody and the atmosphere is better for everyone
4507453 so i think its just a matter of being proactive leading up to the games and just communicating with people well and having a place where they know who to contact and we have the ability to make changes quickly
4507454 hopefully we can set some trends make sure early we can intercept people who arent showing up find out if theres a reason and hopefully find a solution
4507455 we thank everyone for supporting us but we want things to remain calm because violence leads to nothing
4507456 the riots were not something my family and i wanted we never wanted violence
4507457 was it really necessary a little boy who as just starting out his life id like to be in his place ive lived longer than him
4507458 trust big word eh what can i say as a family what we want is for police to be impartial and that it doesnt take centuries to find answers on the death of my brother
4507459 i have been living outside for 17 years so its going to be hard to live inside
4507460 i think gordon campbell got embarrassed in beijing for the homeless situation here
4507461 im hoping the suites arent full of bedbugs as many of the suites currently are
4507462 thats bull ive been on a waiting list for six months
4507463 i dont know where im going to sleep tonight im going to walk around tonight until i find a place to go
4507464 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get
4507465 a country as young prosperous healthy and intelligent as canada should be doing better
4507466 not to say it puts us on equal footing with australia
4507467 im not really upset with canadian athletes im upset with canada
4507468 we dont fund them we give them no money to train we dont focus on phys ed in school were closing pools
4507469 lets face it as competitors weve never been at the top of the list until we adopt a winning mentality and some patriotism we will always be content just being in mediocrity
4507470 the people who follow these sports between olympics they recognize the great performances
4507471 people who tune in just for the olympics they see the medal table and it looks like a disappointment
4507472 when we won the bid for the games we recognized that the atmosphere is impacted significantly by how the host country does
4507473 our athletes will be able to step on the snow and the ice feeling theyve had all the support they needed to meet the high expectations for them
4507474 look i am not an apologist for chinas environmental record its record and legacy are a traumatic one
4507475 but we have all seen the efforts being made at these olympics and they hold promise a bit less judgment for what chinas progressive leaders are trying to do might be appropriate at this stage
4507476 china did not start planting trees at the olympics that began 20 years ago now it is one of the only asian countries where forest cover is increasing the chinese have proven to themselves they are capable of far reaching innovation
4507477 china has some of the worst environmental problems in the world but it is paying more attention to both pollution and degradation they realise environmental degradation affects economic development
4507478 this should give the reformers and progressive environmental groups in the government far greater possibility for influence
4507479 people in beijing are not going to forget that the air can be cleaner
4507480 i have based my assessment on the empirical evidence i have no reason to doubt that the numbers are genuine
4507481 ive been to beijing a lot and walked outside so i felt the difference and subjectively if you compare it to an average day in nairobi you can taste more sulphur in the air there
4507482 i see china accelerating environmental efforts much more than other developing nations
4507483 improvement does not mean you have reached an optimum state of affairs though
4507484 i was surprised and disappointed that the worlds media immediately took the side of georgian president mikheil saakashvili last week
4507485 the truth is that in this case russian aggression actually made some sense
4507486 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4507487 because of massive database corruption in their oracle cluster caused by a botched upgrade
4507488 filed under business google google is to introduce close integration between its two main advertising systems
4507489 i thought twitter was a useless toy at first but now i see it has potential to be a great tool
4507490 respectful of how much weve done to bring new audiences into the market
4507491 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists
4507492 were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities
4507493 gamesindustry biz is essential reading i read it daily as my main online source of information about the european games market operating in a fast changing global business i have to have up to date reliable information gamesindustry biz is a great resource the team are highly professional and well regarded

4507507 all talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa
4507508 so if anyone wants to talk about barry they must talk with rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa
4507509 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4507510 in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4507511 if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4507512 everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4507513 if you want to talk about players you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football you talk with me
4507514 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4507515 we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
4507516 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities
4507517 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4507518 todays settlement is a major step towards making these investors whole
4507519 i have received hundreds of calls from missourians and investors around the nation who need their money to make medical payments run their businesses or retire as planned i am pleased that six months of uncertainty and worry is over and that these investors will soon get their money back
4507520 my son your place is here in the ice village you know nothing of hollywood and its ways

4507522 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4507523 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4507524 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4507525 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4507526 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4507527 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4507528 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4507529 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4507530 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4507531 we will obviously recognise when ramadan is on but that doesnt mean were going to be soft on crime or stop and searches
4507532 we recognise people will have gone for a whole day without food and may be a little more tetchy
4507533 the people who are stopped and searched in that area are not all algerian or muslim my officers are aware of the sensitivities around people who are fasting and that they may be more excitable or volatile but were not going to say well stop looking for knives or gun its a bit of a strange request
4507534 we want them to carry out stop and search as well as other visible operations only when necessary as opposed to random operations
4507535 we dont want them to deter people from coming to the area because its a gathering place for algerians during the holy month of ramadan we dont want them to stop doing their job but were hoping this will be an area of peace
4507536 we hope the holy month of ramadan will be one of peace and tolerance and will see no further unnecessary and controversial police actions on blackstock road
4507537 this does not mean we are against targeting criminals however it can be done in a more accurate manner taking into account the sensitivities particular to our community
4507538 this has created a climate of mistrust and dangerous tensions between the authorities and many members of our community who felt alienated
4507539 wow how could the brewers draft that kid when theyre all set with prince fielder

4507548 manufacturing activity appears to be stabilizing the new york region posted a gain and that was similar to what was seen in the national industrial production numbers
4507549 what seems to be occurring in a number of sectors is the cycle working its way through though few sectors other than agriculture and exporters are doing fine we have to stop falling before we start rising
4507550 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed

4507554 im eager to welcome students on moving day and make sure they take advantage of all the resources both the city and the university provide for them to stay safe and have a great year here in madison
4507555 a lot of people are not moving and trying to put money in to their existing property coming to us adds value and makes properties easier to sell
4507556 we offer a professional service the client can come and look at their product being made and if they want small changes put in we can do that thats the difference with our company
4507557 the customer is involved all the way through the process
4507558 we havent seen a change probably because we are at the top end of the market theres been no decrease whatsoever just yesterday i got asked to do three kitchens
4507559 what i have found is that customers who would normally buy from a high street shop and spend up to 120 000 on a kitchen come to us as they see that we can make units to any specification without that high street cost
4507560 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4507561 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4507562 wal mart seems to be willing to break federal election law in order to stop their employees and all of americas workers from having a fair shot at the american dream
4507563 this person has garnered much opposition so i cant trust him either
4507564 the qualifications of voters the deadline for nominations and all other matters related to the conduct of this election are to be determined by the commission subject to review by the board
4507565 who came up with these rules why was there no community input
4507566 if the community is willing to delegate decision making power to a committee
4507567 or whatever and crosslinking the two an example is support number 126 for giano last time around which was crosslinked to the talk page here most voting page talk pages had a section for this sort of thing evidence 14 27 5 august 2008 utc

4507570 with all of the incredible things that have happened at the park over the past few years this has to rank as one of the most significant

4507572 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4507573 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in europe and pacific industrialised nations oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world oil demand growth the lowest since 2002

4507577 ich hatte einen tollen urlaub aber es ist sch n wieder auf dem bike zu sitzen
4507578 der heutige tag hat gut begonnen und ich bin mit dem motorrad und den reifen sehr zufrieden die bridgestones scheinen hier bislang sehr gut zu funktionieren
4507579 der neue asphaltbelag ist gut und viel besser als im vergangenen jahr
4507580 morgen k nnte es regnen was sehr schade ist aber wir haben heute ein gutes setup gefunden auch wenn es nass sein sollte m ssten wir am sonntag gut in form sein
4507581 wir haben ein paar kleine modifikationen am motor dabei werden damit aber wohl bis montag warten denn da findet der wichtige test statt
4507582 wir hatten einen guten start und waren den ganzen tag ber stark wir haben einiges ausprobiert und verschiedene reifen aufgezogen um so viele informationen wie m glich zu sammeln nur f r den fall dass es morgen regnen sollte
4507583 nat rlich hoffen wir auf trockene bedingungen aber die chancen stehen eher schlecht daher wollten wir heute m glichst viel aus diesem tag herausholen um vorbereitet zu sein der tag war gut und wir hoffen so weitermachen zu k nnen
4507584 k rperlich f hle ich mich sehr gut ich habe lediglich schmerzen wenn ich in der garage zum bike laufe sitze ich darauf ist alles bestens
4507585 ich bin zuversichtlich brauche aber noch eine halbe sekunde um an der spitze mithalten zu k nnen das hauptproblem ist der frontreifen
4507586 ich mache mir sorgen denn der erste michelin pilot liegt nur auf rang sieben was nicht besonders gro artig ist wir m ssen alle daran arbeiten um das zu verbessern wir arbeiten eng mit michelin und yamaha zusammen und versuchen an diesem wochenende eine bessere l sung f r uns zu finden
4507587 im moment ist es sehr schwierig im trockenen um das podium zu k mpfen und das nasse k nnen wir noch nicht einsch tzen mein hauptziel f r dieses wochenende ist in den top 7 zu landen der neue asphalt ist besser als im vorjahr eine gute sache
4507588 etwas muss ich noch loswerden juanito einer meiner mechaniker ist gro vater geworden gl ckwunsch dazu
4507589 wir haben viel gl ck dass jorges k rperliche verfassung okay ist besser als wir erwartet hatten
4507590 und das ist noch unser geringstes problem heute unser gr tes thema ist das vertrauen in die front wir haben nicht genug grip und jorge kann nicht schnell genug in die kurven eintauchen au erdem untersteuert das bike bei voller neigung und daher verlieren wir in den kurven viel zeit
4507591 wir konnten unser paket seit der morgendlichen session verbessern aber leider nicht genug um an der spitze dabei sein zu k nnen heute nacht werden wir eng mit michelin zusammenarbeiten und die daten analysieren um dem gripproblem an der front auf die spur zu kommen

4507595 the summer months tend to draw americans to more leisure pursuits and that was certainly the case in july
4507596 ground travel and cruise sites gained once again as many americans sought more budget friendly ways to enjoy their summer vacations amid economic and fuel price concerns summer blockbusters and big celebrity news also provided a boost to the entertainment categories
4507597 were just at a point where we dont have much if any information to act upon
4507598 the pain his death caused his family is indescribable and his only transgression was being in the wrong place at the wrong time

4507600 my father was a great person a great father and a great provider
4507601 this is what this person or persons took away from us
4507602 there is a bit of russian in all of us
4507603 im sitting in a hotel room in germany in the middle of my summer tour with the tv news telling me that my is being torn to pieces
4507604 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before its never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
4507605 with the russians still being in gori there are reports that they have stopped fighting but you dont need to be killing a countrys people or its soldiers to paralyse it
4507606 you see gori is right in the middle of the only road that goes from west to east across georgia
4507607 its the road that my mum and brother need to travel on to catch their return flight out of tbilisi
4507608 georgia has always had shaky politics especially after the break up of the and the civil war that followed in the 90s
4507609 more recently things appeared to be getting better the economy was growing the major cities were starting to look cleaner electricity blackouts like the ones when i lived there were almost unheard of
4507610 if you dont like something change it if you cant change it change your attitude dont complain

4507929 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4507930 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4507931 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4507932 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4507933 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy

4507944 die zijn nu niet aangekondigd maar ze liggen er wel
4507945 de aangekondigde reorganisatie is onvoldoende er wordt achter de feiten aangehold over twee jaar kun je een nieuwe reductie van banen verwachten als er niet structureel in de kosten wordt gesneden
4507946 daarmee zou het bedrijf zowel intern als extern een signaal afgeven om aan te geven dat het daadwerkelijk menens en echt een andere koers gaat varen
4507947 its good because it takes the pressure off of us
4507948 seriously though we have to play and act like champions and once we believe in ourselves that we can do it again win the championship then i am sure we will be thereabouts again
4507949 i can assure you there is no deep end with benny
4507950 he is a class act a wonderful talent and he will get better which is frightening
4507951 the thing is he is normally a centre midfielder yet the way he played in the centre of defence tonight youd swear he has been doing this all of his life
4507952 he is so young that he told me he still lines up to see the harry potter movies well thats what he told me

4507957 shes very impressive i am not going to be swimming when i am 40
4507958 hopefully i will be married with kids and they wont be swimming either
4507959 the last day and a bit has been quite full on and very taxing mentally and physically and i am still seeing that in the water
4507960 im looking forward to a day off and not doing much so i can recover and get back to speed
4507961 a day is a long time and i hadnt had a session off for five days i am very confident today will be a different day and a lot faster
4507962 im in the final and that is all that matters
4507963 after last night i was feeling really flat and something clicked in this morning i am rapt ive won a bronze medal in the 4x100m and now i am in the olympic final for the 50 so i am really happy
4507964 you have just got to spice it up a little bit these earrings are actually stephs she said you can have them for good luck so obviously it is working and i hope it works tomorrow
4507965 when you see your club mate every day and then come to the olympics and see her get three gold and three world records you cant ask for much better she is one of my best friends so it is amazing seeing her do that and i look up to her
4507966 the main goal for me this morning was to come out and be relaxed and to stand up next to phelps and not be afraid so i ticked that goal off
4507967 two weeks ago and since that fateful day i cannot get all ten songs out of my head it keeps on reverberating over and over and over again haha

4507977 we gave ourselves as many chances down their end in that first half and i think they had three chances in our end executed three times and came up with three tries
4507978 were very proud to have held the shield for the last two years and to be able to put three in a row together would be special
4507979 we always wanted to retain the giltinan shield and then when we lost that game we thought its gone now given the way manlys been playing this year but the last two weeks wevegot ourselves back into contention
4507980 weve been proud owners of the minor premiership the last couple of years and i think its a little bit undervalued in our game
4507981 to be at the top of the table after 26 rounds in this tough competition is a real credit to the team that does that
4507982 ill do the 100 metres no problem and then back up for the marathon
4507983 it probably did we thought we would have got a medal by now
4507984 she was his biggest supporter because we lost dad 20 years ago but mum was always there for him
4507985 hes had to travel a lot to overseas competition so he deserves this he really does
4507986 thats why the medal is so wonderful for him because hes had a tough year
4507987 you could tell from just talking to him he didnt seem as relaxed as he normally is
4507988 there were a lot of people talking to him about it in the village this week
4507989 i think i was more excited than him but he sounded really drained
4507990 i asked him if he remembered standing on the podium and he said i think so
4507991 it would have relieved some of the pressure and the tension
4507992 when i saw the final scores i was quite happy
4507993 i was happy with my performance my training hasnt been crash hot this week
4507994 but he loves shooting so he wouldnt see it as hard work
4507995 warren is a dedicated shooter and his greatest competitor is himself
4507996 its never been a case of him just going down to the club having a practice and going home
4507997 he shoots to the point where even a nine is not good enough hell stay until he shoots a 10
4507998 you could go down both sides of the street there
4507999 if eamon sullivan is going to swim his first 15m in 5 25 seconds well he needs to be training at exactly that speed in the old days there was people swimming 129km a week to swim a 100m sprint well i think those days are gone
4508000 i gave it everything i couldnt have done anything more she was just better on the day i wouldnt say i lost i did the best job i could and it took a world record for her to win it
4508001 i am so thankful because in athens i didnt get a second chance
4508002 i was so happy to get silver it would have been great to get gold but it was an amazing race and i fought hard for it
4508003 theres no way i could be disappointed because i should have been out yesterday
4508004 julia we have an exremely overweight german general who has some vital info you know what to do
4508005 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
4508006 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4508007 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
4508008 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4508009 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
4508010 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel
4508011 i didnt know i had as little time as i actually did
4508012 i didnt even have time to go into the ready room i went directly from the ceremony to taking my award sweats off putting on my parka and trying to put my cap and goggles on
4508013 i just cant be a body length behind at the first 50 it makes it harder for me to get through the waves from the others
4508014 it would be nice if historians talk about michael phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to some guy id like to be that guy
4508015 every time i get in the water and race him or aaron peirsol i believe that i can win thats the way i have trained my mind i feel like i can win no matter what the race
4508016 i know i am clean and i did project believe with usada because i wanted to do more tests to prove it
4508017 i didnt want to see him not do himself justice
4508018 hes been a wonderful player a great player i was pleased for him tonight that he showed he could play in the nrl again thats the only pleasure i took
4508019 at this time of year when you lead 12 0 when youre trying to get to what were trying to achieve it cant happen
4508020 youll have to sell some of your office supplies to buy one the budget is closed
4508021 we were hoping for a couple of medals in the shooting with michael diamond and russell mark just missing out and our cycling is down a little too
4508022 our gold count might be a little less than we thought at this stage with libby and leisel missing out yesterday
4508023 so its not all over yet by a long shot
4508024 at the beginning athletes wanted to talk about how to handle pressure but now its more about dealing with disappointment
4508025 im telling them its ok to be disappointed because it shows you care about your sport
4508026 its a big issue with retirees having a real downer after being in the spotlight for so long
4508027 they learn fast that their high profile can suddenly vanish and its tough and then there are the athletes whove come here with expectations that have not been fulfilled so theres plenty of work to be done in this area
4508028 we know theyre going to go to bars and nightclubs and mix with athletes from other countries but we have also stressed that they have to be careful
4508029 and we get them tickets to go and support the australian teams that are still competing
4508030 very aware leading into these games of the problems with the allocation of tickets tothe national olympic committees
4508031 its been terrible for us explaining to parents that we cant get them tickets to see their kids perform after theyve come this far
4508032 they have to give up a lot and not just in terms of time and effort but also money to get their children to the elite level its an area we definitely want the federal government to help out with in funding
4508033 i had dinner with a hong kong ioc member before the games and he couldnt emphasise enough how important it was for rudd to come to the games not for the politics but because of the positive message it would send to the young people of china
4508034 the new generation of chinese leaders are far more open and interested in the world and if mr rudd had not come it would have painted australia in a very bad light
4508035 yes in terms of degree of difficulty its been harder because weve come into a different society its a communist state
4508036 there are problems not only in openness but also in decision making and that can be frustrating the average person here isnt used to making decisions they have to ask someone higher up and so its hard
4508037 i found that out with the ticketing issue the head of bocog is not the head of the party and thats the reality youre dealing with
4508038 if you study to remember you will forget but if you study to understand you will remember
4508039 norma mi je bila dohvatljiva da sam bila zdrava zadnja etiri dana imam temperaturu koja je sino bila skoro 38 stupnjeva i jednostavno nisam imala snage ni brzine za bolje hice znam da ovo sada zvu i kao opravdanje ali stvarno nisam mogla

4508042 my weight has always fluctuated and no matter how much weight i lost through diet and exercise i have always had certain stubborn areas of fat that i just could never seem to shift during the x factor i lost just under two stone but my body was still quite a boxy shape having liposuction has completely changed my shape giving me curves in all the right places clothes look so much better on me now and i feel a lot more feminine and in proportion i am so please with the results
4508043 mya ensured i understood that having liposuction is not a weight loss solution but is more about re shaping the body making it more streamlined
4508044 i did experience some bruising and swelling which is typical of the liposuction procedure and i really started to notice significant results after a few weeks once the swelling began to go down a couple of months on i cant believe the change it has made i never thought i would ever fit in to a pair of skinny jeans and now i do and they are a size 10 12
4508045 she was the most popular judge and was really good to me and my family
4508046 smatsas decision to select park air systems for a third time as their supplier of choice for ground to air communications highlights the quality of our solutions and the skill and dedication of our staff in delivering highly complex systems we look forward to a close partnership with smatsa over the coming months as we implement this important system that will facilitate handling the increasing number of flights that this air navigation service provider will face for many years to come
4508047 cooperation between our two project teams has been a major factor in the success of the projects and we continue to have an open and flexible relationship with park air for the long term support of our systems
4508048 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4508049 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4508050 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4508051 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4508052 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4508053 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4508054 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4508055 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4508056 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4508057 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
4508058 the launch of the e programme is the latest in a succession of cutting edge ways the club is using digital media to communicate with our fans
4508059 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
4508060 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
4508061 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
4508062 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
4508063 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
4508064 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence
4508065 and the naacp was formally organized less than a year after that

4508109 and for the sake of his business feyissa said he fears the article casts him as a troublemaker who files frivolous discrimination complaints not exactly the image he wants as a civil rights lawyer
4508110 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4508111 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
4508112 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
4508113 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
4508114 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4508115 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4508116 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4508117 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4508118 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4508119 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4508120 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4508121 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4508122 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4508123 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4508124 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4508125 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4508126 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
4508127 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

4508221 sterke halfjaarcijfers hebben weer eens bewezen dat fugro een goed gemanaged bedrijf is met een solide uitvoering
4508222 echter gezien de omvang van de reductie zijn gedwongen ontslagen onvermijdelijk
4508223 het eerste halfjaar van 2008 kenmerkte zich door ongekende bewegingen in de financi le markten en een inverse rentecurve

4508226 alleen als een arts heeft aangegeven dat een ander geneesmiddel medisch noodzakelijk is wordt daarop een uitzondering gemaakt

4508231 die zijn nu niet aangekondigd maar ze liggen er wel
4508232 de aangekondigde reorganisatie is onvoldoende er wordt achter de feiten aangehold over twee jaar kun je een nieuwe reductie van banen verwachten als er niet structureel in de kosten wordt gesneden
4508233 daarmee zou het bedrijf zowel intern als extern een signaal afgeven om aan te geven dat het daadwerkelijk menens en echt een andere koers gaat varen
4508234 zelfs de verlaagde verwachting van ten minste 8 voor 2008 lijkt ons zeer uitdagend omdat de winstgevendheid flink moet aantrekken in de tweede jaarhelft tmg geeft aan dat alle signalen op rood staan wat betreft het macro economische klimaat
4508235 de vooruitzichten zijn onzeker en wij verwachten dat de omzet en winst verder zullen afnemen
4508236 de onderneming en zijn vooruitzichten wezenlijk onderwaardeert en dat de voorgestelde transactie onaantrekkelijk is voor aandeelhouders aangezien zij minderheidsaandeelhouders worden in een onderneming gecontroleerd door adecco

4508275 the world market demand for lithium ion cells is presently at its highest point ever two major suppliers of this cell type had catastrophic fires in their assembly plants within the last year that severely diminished the available quantity to the world market the u s military requires a huge amount of this rechargeable energy source and the demand grows daily lyntronics is concerned as to how we will meet this demand and satisfy our contractual obligations currently there are no domestic producers of these cells and this is a situation which is not desirable a domestic source of lithium ion cells would help ensure that the supply to our military forces will not be jeopardized electro energys entry into this marketplace is timed perfectly we have tested and had the military test their product for use in our batteries and have concluded that their cells are well within specification we have therefore purchased a sizable quantity of cells to meet our ever increasing lithium ion needs

4508280 the asia pacific consulting marketplace 2008 2011 key trends profiles and forecasts
4508281 even in 2005 interest in the apac region was driven primarily by opportunistic servicing of growing domestic consulting demand in each market and the wish to support global clients in their endeavors in asia pacific
4508282 today a much larger group of firms has moved toward an overall strategic interest in the apac region such interest is unsurprising for the it consulting space since offshore outsourcing links have already been playing an important role in that area more surprising is how strategic interest is very quickly coming to play across the whole consulting landscape

4508286 are you saying that obamas skin color is a metaphor for a blackness of heart
4508287 obama is of mixed ancestry he is black but he does not speak in the language of the ghetto joseph biden he is so articulate he is also partly white and he can speak of his mother from kansas he transcends race and racial identity thus he also transcends racial divisions he transcends partisan politics he transcends ideology he transcends traditional ways of doing things he is his own new paradigm he is the forerunner of a new era in america

4508292 apparently the ex dem turned independent mayor of linden and some dem council members have endorsed mccain
4508293 and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with
4508294 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
4508295 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
4508296 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
4508297 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
4508298 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
4508299 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
4508300 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
4508301 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
4508302 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4508303 the last few days four or five days weve seen one of the most unexpected crises in the world as the russians moved into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
4508304 the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be
4508305 you got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to senator obama cause he is a gifted young man but he is not ready to be president
4508306 sen mccain is ready to be commander in chief on day one tested in war and peace he has passed both tests with honor that shows not only his ability but his character

4508312 some critics say kerry could face a more challenging re election because of the decision to endorse sen barack obama for president over sen hillary clinton who won his states super tuesday primary with 56 percent of the vote
4508313 i dont think you have to be a mathematician to divine that senator kerrys early endorsement of senator obama put our opponent on the ballot
4508314 many of sen clintons supporters have made it clear that they wanted to register their displeasure with sen kerrys endorsement
4508315 you got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to senator obama cause he is a gifted young man but he is not ready to be president
4508316 the vast majority of white people living in this country had no ancestors who ever owned slaves

4508370 a qualitative review of the studies found a consistent and strong association between the exposure to fluoride and low iq
4508371 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides thyroid and bone damage and the cdcs recommendation against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the national kidney foundations withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment
4508372 there have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers iq in children and only 2 that dont
4508373 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
4508374 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
4508375 the canadian dental association says there is no evidence to support the claims that fluoride in drinking water can lead to lower iqs
4508376 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
4508377 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

4508393 i bet he gets 15 20 million a year for three or four years especially if he keeps his nose clean and helps the dodgers win it
4508394 hell it wouldnt surprise me if dodgers owner frank mccourt would do that he loves all those boston guys
4508395 ill tell you that i might cost my team a chance to go to the world series but we work too hard to put a team together to take on a guy like that as soon as you open the vaults for him youll wind up with the same problems boston had

4508426 y de los nueve casos que se conocen agrega el m dico cinco fueron descubiertos en espa a
4508427 para que el organismo pueda llegar a una respuesta inflamatoria explica el doctor rodrigo alguien le tiene que avisar al sistema inmune para que lance su defensa
4508428 pero en estos ni os falla una de las mol culas encargadas de avisar al sistema inmune de la presencia de una infecci n y de que debe responder a ella

4508433 snap2face and friendmobilizer give you many of the same features as the facebook branded mobile apps but with little of the visual refinement snap2face uses a tabbed interface to switch between your profile and your friends pages then places mini facebook icons at the bottom of each screen so you can partake in photo viewing and message sending activities snap2face also boasts a photo album slide show and a feature that syncs facebook profile photos to your phone contacts both would have been neat had the app not been plagued by crashes and hang ups that required us to frequently refresh the screen or restart the app installation could also be smoother but because one component of snap2face is a third party facebook app youll need to give it log in permission via facebook com

4508443 a global economy energized by technological change and unprecedented flows of people and money collapses in the wake of a terrorist attack the year is 1914 worldwide war results exhausting the resources of the great powers and convincing many that the economic system itself is to blame from the ashes of the catastrophe an intellectual and political struggle ignites between the powers of government and the forces of the marketplace each determined to reinvent the worlds economic order two individuals emerge whose ideas shaped by very different experiences will inform this debate and carry it forward one is a brilliant unconventional englishman named john maynard keynes the other is an outspoken migr from ravaged austria friedrich von hayek but a worldwide depression holds the capitalist nations in its grip in opposition to both keynes and hayek stand not only hitlers third reich but stalins soviet union schooled in the communist ideologies of marx and lenin and bent on obliterating the capitalist system altogether for more than half a century the battle of ideas will rage from the totalitarian socialist systems to the fascist states from the independent nations of the developing world to the mixed economies of europe and the regulated capitalism of the united states government planning will gradually take over the commanding heights but in the 1970s with keynesian theory at its height and communism fully entrenched economic stagnation sets in on all sides when a british grocers daughter and a former hollywood actor become heads of state they join forces around the ideas of hayek and new political and economic policies begin to transform the world

4508471 to me its all about attitude you gotta show up ready to do something i dont think most people get up in the morning to fail i dont see obstacles as hardships i see them as challenges and opportunities to answer the question of how can i make myself grow

4508482 their continued strength is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets therefore we must take steps to address the current situation as we move to a stronger regulatory structure
4508483 access to the feds discount window will be a very effective tool to defuse the short term liquidity crisis
4508484 but the treasury will need to specify very soon within a matter of two or three days how much capital that it intends to infuse into the two entities
4508485 this capital infusion needs to be very significant perhaps as much as 20 billion or higher for both entities in order to defuse the speculative selling and reverse the negative psychology quickly and effectively
4508486 not the time for policy makers to underestimate once again the systemic risks to the financial system and the huge collateral damage this would impose on the economy
4508487 we hope the us treasury and federal reserve move will have a positive impact on the world economy
4508488 significant challenges and downside risks in the international financial markets remain and financial institutions and investors should stay vigilant
4508489 if mortgage losses mount at the two gses then the us treasury will issue more debt and use the proceeds to inject more capital into them
4508490 the american public now gets a direct stake in the worlds two largest hedge funds
4508491 the key to gauging the real economic impact is whether these two organisations can continue to provide their services to the mortgage market and ease the continued creation of new mortgages

4508522 to me these cards represent thousands of voices crying out to be heard on this issue
4508523 the citizens are not going to be held hostage by the threat of lawsuits
4508524 there is a pretty strong divide as i am sure there is in the democratic party on this
4508525 so it is probably going to be difficult for us to take a position as a party
4508526 voting is the heart of the democratic process and we are pursuing a recount as that is the fairest way possible to make sure the peoples voice through the election is most accurately heard
4508527 i have received encouragement to pursue the recount from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters at this stage the recount becomes a legal procedure
4508528 lathrop amp gage has handled election recounts like this many times before
4508529 as candidates are able to request a recount whenever their losing margin is less than 1 percentage point and given the slim margin separating the candidates at the top we feel it is in the best interest of the state and of all those who voted to make sure there is no error in tabulating the final results and that the votes of all citizens are counted for this important race

4508532 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4508533 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4508534 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4508535 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4508536 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4508537 i was not involved in the talks about alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions

4508545 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4508547 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
4508548 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
4508549 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
4508550 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
4508551 i think our european and american colleagues should understand what is happening and i hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions
4508552 if we stand together there is no force that can defeat georgia defeat freedom and defeat a nation striving for freedom no matter how many planes tanks and missiles they use against us
4508553 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
4508554 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
4508555 we will not give up and we will achieve victory i call on everyone to mobilize i declare here and now a universal mobilization of the nation and the republic of georgia
4508556 i hereby announce that reserve officers are called up everyone must come to mobilization center and fight to save our country
4508557 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
4508558 georgia wants to get back its territory and thats lawful this is aggression from the russian side they bombed our land
4508559 this is hell its a disaster but we have to fight to the end because russia must be taught a lesson that it cannot act like this in the 21st century
4508560 america was seen as an ally and georgian soldiers have been dying in iraq in the interests of global security but the west has shown that it doesnt care about russia invading other countries all they did was express concerns while bombs were falling on us

4508577 collected 200 million less in property taxes simply put that is 200 million left in the pockets of property owners and left out of the hands of the government to spend

4508582 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes

4508622 on february 5 the defendant and his pregnant wife were late for an appointment at the royal oldham hospital
4508623 at reception scott morris was taking a call he told the defendant he wouldnt be a moment and to take a seat
4508624 mr morris then had to leave the reception momentarily but indicated he would be back quickly
4508625 mr morris warned the defendant that he would call security and asked if the words were being directed at him
4508626 at this point a health care assistant came to reception and the defendant swore when telling her the man had been on the phone and was ignoring him
4508627 she said the defendant had his finger constantly pressed on the bell
4508628 when she asked him to take a seat the defendant became very agitated he came so close their faces were touching pity she didnt give him a glaswegian kiss
4508629 he then shouted listen white bitch ill sit down when i want to sit down racism had he been white prison without a doubt
4508630 she said he lifted his left hand above his head and she believed he was about to hit her
4508631 a security guard tried to deal with the incident he said the defendant was gesturing with his fingers in the shape of a gun saying ill come back and shoot you
4508632 mr miah attended hospital with his heavily pregnant wife who was suffering problems with her diabetes
4508633 they were a little late for their appointment and the defendant was clearly concerned that they had missed the appointment

4508651 im going back to 170 because for one my body weight is just adjusted
4508652 when i used to cut to 170 back when i fought diego sanchez and those guys it was a really really tough cut my body has adapted now its easier
4508653 im at the point in my career where i want a big fight
4508654 i need a big fight like that to push myself back into the top 10 styles make fights and this is a good style for me
4508655 misaki likes to stand up and throw hes more of a counter fighter im going to keep it on the feet im going to press forward and keep going he likes to rely on his speed and im faster than he is technical wise im better than ive ever been in my career
4508656 the reason i want to fight somebody like misaki more than a lesser opponent is because im not as young as i used to be
4508657 im 25 years old im not old or anything im just tired of stagnating
4508658 i want to jump back up there when i leave strikeforce i want to build up the momentum and carry that over to my next contract whoever that may be with like the ufc or something
4508659 ive got to weigh my options strikeforce is a cool company i like strikeforce promoter scott coker and those guys they pay me good money but i miss fighting on those bigger shows
4508660 i asked for my release from the ufc in 2007 and they gave it to me after that sometimes the grass isnt always greener on the other side i do miss fighting in the ufc
4508661 im going to be in the sport for many more years
4508662 im only 25 years old ive got a decade left to go maybe when i do get older it might be hard to get that weight off me i might go back to 185 pounds in later years but for the next couple years to come 170 pounds is definitely where ill be at
4508663 ive not been feeling well for a few days and i felt very weak today i even felt sapped of energy just putting my gloves on
4508664 i can deal with a bit of tiredness but this afternoon i could only ride a handful of laps before i started to feel cramps in my stomach
4508665 that doesnt help my crew because ive not been able to put many consecutive laps together and this morning wasnt too good for us we struggled to find the right set up for this new surface
4508666 to look at youd think it would be smooth on the tyres but its actually quite aggressive particularly on the front
4508667 this afternoon we went with a harder compound front tyre similar to what we used at laguna and sachsenring which is about the hardest weve got and we had to work on the geometry to get the most effective load on the front tyre
4508668 the guys improved the bike every time i came in so it was frustrating not to be able to put it all together with a long run we still have a lot of work to do so hopefully ill feel better tomorrow and the weather holds out for us
4508669 we started out well this morning and did some decent lap times but in the afternoon we didnt manage to make progress with the set up and as the other riders improved we lost more and more ground
4508670 the bike is moving around a lot especially on the rear so thats an area we have to work on tomorrow weather permitting
4508671 saya senang sekali bisa memenangi pertandingan semifinal ini sehingga harapan bisa mempertahankan tradisi merebut emas dari bulutangkis oleh indonesia bisa tetap dipertahankan

4508675 if you have mastered the blogging paradigm have made your blog an authority and a reliable source of information commentary or news in your selected field s of interest it is about time to
4508676 but isnt this what most tech and media bloggers do
4508677 the layered mechanism works because at no point is the entire weight of the filtering process concentrated in a single individual or a single resource

4508698 the lawn if you know where the blades actually are scalping of the lawn happens when the blades cut far too close to the soil line way below the height the grass can withstand usually this results in either dead grass weeds moss or a combination of the three most scalping occurs on high spots or bumps on the lawn or they occur where the lawn meets the drive or sidewalk and the soil is a little high here is an illustration taken right out of my book building a healthy lawn a safe and natural approach you can see in the top drawing how the wheels of the mower sit on both sides of the high spot resulting in a scalp the mower would have to be moved a few inches to either side to avoid this the second drawing shows how the point where the lawn meets the walk gets scalped this happens when he soil under the grass is higher than the walkway and the mower wheel is positioned on the walk but close to the grass you can see that the mower and the mower blades are at an angle cutting down into the corner move the mower wheels further out into the walkway lessening the tilt of the mower and thus keeping the blades higher at the edge of the lawn you might only be cutting 5 6

4508711 i am delighted that the proposals for a special area policy for licensing in our historic town centre has gone to formal consultation
4508712 this new policy will put the onus on the applicant to prove how they will prevent nuisance from their establishment from the very outset they will be asked to consider how they will prevent the deterioration of the quality of life local residents enjoy
4508713 the need for a vibrant evening economy is clear but this must not be to the detriment of quality of life in the area to my mind this policy strikes the perfect balance

4508723 its a recognition that life is short and rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end
4508724 she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society

4508726 my goal remains to professionalize our inspections divisions through increased and ongoing training
4508727 as with the residential inspectors this was not the outcome we had hoped for but we must move forward with a professionalized staff
4508728 this is a complete sham to cover up management failures
4508729 it is no secret that dcra is a mess this is endemic to what weve seen in other d c agencies and frankly we are concerned as there is no legal reason why these inspectors should be fired

4508732 we lagen met momenten eerste door iets te conservatief te zijn op het einde rondden we als vierde de eerste boei maar met echt veel voorsprong op de rest van de vloot daar lieten we ons echter meeslepen door de amerikanen die als enigen een code zero ophebben en dus voor de wind veel hoger varen vanaf dan kwam het niet meer goed en verloren we constant plaatsen we finishten uiteindelijk als 11e best frustrerend ik had me wel een toffer begin kunnen inbeelden
4508733 om kwart over vijf gingen we met ondergaande zon van start met een zeer variable wind zowel in kracht als in richting ik was niet goed weg bij de pin ik had zes overstags nodig om vrije wind te zoeken en dat was wat teveel van het goede ik zocht de linkerkant op in het kruisrak en kwam 15e rond de bovenboei voor de wind had ik een goede vlaag en kon ik er drie inhalen in het tweede aan de windse rak was ik opnieuw te terughoudend ik won wel wat maar er had heel veel meer kunnen inzitten en dat geldt ook voor de rest van de race

4508742 for 2012 if i would have told you a month ago i would have said no that i was done but after being here and experiencing the whole thing its just a dream come true i gave my heart and soul out there and i couldnt be happier or prouder of myself id give anything to feel that again if i can in 2012 ill be there no matter what

4508755 i think its in violation of ethical rules which talk about a lawyer not releasing evidence that is likely to prejudice a proceeding
4508756 i think its contemptuous of this proceeding on the part of the defense
4508757 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4508758 thats so much better than a number on a scale

4508765 i knew i needed to eat in order to have energy but at the time i really didnt think about it too scientifically
4508766 it was very simple if i was hungry i ate
4508767 after i retired i immediately hit puberty and it was tough my entire body changed
4508768 i went from working out over 40 hours a week to nothing and kept eating the same amount of food it took some time but i figured out an everything in moderation approach that works for me

4508773 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4508774 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4508775 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory

4508779 we dont have any new scenario to cut palm oil export tax other than the existing progressive tax
4508780 it has been adjusted with movements in global prices so if global prices fall the palm oil export tax will also fall
4508781 the obvious areas of concerns remained the uk ireland and spain where you have something similar to what happened in the us but happening with a 9 to 12 month lag
4508782 things can get considerably worse in those economies from an equities market point of view i wouldnt touch these stocks
4508783 the areas we would strongly avoid are ireland the benelux the domestic uk names and the smaller spanish names as well because of their exposure to local housing markets and their relatively low capital ratios in some cases
4508784 for deutsche bank its a matter of time before they have trouble themselves and against the likes of ubs credit suisse merrill lynch or goldman sachs their capital ratios look on the low side
4508785 strong balance sheet decent growth in their own economy an economy that has been liberalising they have no funding problems and are in growing markets they have everything you want to have and have avoided everything you dont want to have
4508786 we were able to buy the stock at a p e multiple of below seven which is quite remarkable
4508787 financial stocks have definitely been battered and when we launched the fund back in december we expected things to be very difficult for the next six months
4508788 but we now think that the issues that have been hanging above the us and had made it very difficult to invest in their financial system are headed toward resolution and were now more interested in picking up us assets
4508789 we have taken our first steps into the us market over the past few weeks weve bought shares in wachovia and we have participated in merrill lynchs capital increase
4508790 but it looks to me that these things are closer to resolution than not and that is enabling the market to move forward

4509186 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4509187 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4509188 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4509189 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4509330 mr bennet zur h lfte ist er bereits in sie verliebt
4509331 mr bingley und es st rt ihn kein bisschen dass sie keinen penny hat denn sein verm gen reicht gut f r sie beide
4509332 oh mr bennet hast du denn gar keine achtung vor meinen armen nerven

4509336 ich wage dennoch zu bezweifeln dass dieser platzregen auf deine rechnung geht
4509337 h tte bingley auch nur einen funken mitleid mit mir gehabt h tte er sich in der ersten runde den kn chel verstaucht
4509338 er hat so einen angenehmen zug um den mund wenn er spricht
4509339 oh herr wickham wie aufmerksam er hob auch mein taschentuch auf hast du deins absichtlich fallen lassen
4509340 er liebte mich wie einen sohn und das konnte darcy nicht verkraften

4509342 oh nein sie m ssen die schande des regiments sein

4509345 und wie soll ich dich nennen wenn ich w tend bin mrs darcy
4509346 nein nein du darfst mich nur dann mrs darcy nennen wenn du absolut vollkommen und rundum gl cklich bist

4509350 er und ich wir sind uns beiden so hnlich wir sind beide so stur
4509351 glaub mir die m nner werden entweder von ihrer arroganz oder von ihrer dummheit aufgezehrt
4509352 ich habe in der letzten zeit viel dar ber nachgedacht wie meine mitmenschen mich sehen und meine handlungen einsch tzen
4509353 ich k nnte ihm seinen stolz leichter vergeben wenn er meinen nicht verletzt h tte
4509354 ich mag ihn wirklich ich habe mich get usch ich habe mich so sehr in ihm get uscht
4509355 ich sollte dir sagen dass du mich ganz und gar verzaubert hast und dass ich dich liebe liebe liebe

4509362 i had an experience with a yorkshire terrier that was given bacon every morning for breakfast
4509363 anything greasy fatty or salty is not good the dog would end up skipping meals waiting on the bacon
4509364 its just like with humans animals dont need them because there is no real benefit
4509365 i feel it leads to a lot of problems health and behavioral problems
4509366 one serving of bacon is like a weeks worth for them
4509367 they do what works and if it doesnt work they dont do it
4509368 i strongly suspect that there is a strong correlation between peace and happiness
4509369 denmark is the happiest country in the world in our ratings
4509370 denmark is prosperous not the richest country in the world but it is prosperous
4509371 though by no means the happiest country in the world from a global perspective the united states looks pretty good
4509372 the country is not only prosperous it ranks relatively high in gender equality tolerance of ethnic and social diversity and has high levels of political freedom
4509373 taking all things together would you say you are very happy rather happy not very happy not at all happy
4509374 all things considered how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days
4509375 ultimately the most important determinant of happiness is the extent to which people have free choice in how to live their lives

4509390 as of a few weeks ago all the funds are there to make it on a low budget no frills level but the main producer is currently producing something else that doesnt get out for a month or so and bruce campbell is not actually acting but he has a producer credit on the big budget hollywood remake of the evil dead ive spoken to him and i know hes up for it but i know that this is insignificant money wise compared to the evil dead remake which will steamroller us if we get in the way its basically a question of juggling our dates to survive
4509391 if youre so funny then why are you on your own tonight and if youre so clever then why are you on your own tonight if youre so very entertaining then why are you on your own tonight if youre so very good looking why do you sleep alone tonight i know cause tonight is just like any other night thats why youre on your own tonight with your triumphs and your charms while theyre in each others arms

4509409 theres some confusion and we havent decided that yet but the point of it is that weve been negotiating for months and its time to put up the product of those negotiations and if they fail republicans can come up with their stuff
4509410 whatever they want to bring to the floor so that we can vote no to taxes and move these negotiations forward so we can get done is fine with me
4509411 i hope that will engage us in the process and help democrats and the governor realize that were not going to support a tax increase
4509412 believes what the democrats put on the floor should have bipartisan support hell continue to push for that compromise until we get a budget
4509413 it is critical that we take action before monday because the democrats have taken budget reform very seriously
4509414 what do we care about going to the ballot for a phony rainy day fund its nothing republicans would vote on
4509415 it is very hard for schwarzenegger to get a preliminary injunction because he has to demonstrate irreparable harm
4509416 whats the irreparable harm in paying salaries to workers that they will eventually get as soon as there is a budget
4509417 weve worked that out i think its to his satisfaction its to our satisfaction i dont know how the republicans feel about that most of them wanted a very hard cap
4509418 our caucus believes the only way to have a reliable reserve a real rainy day fund is to limit the growth of spending when revenue growth is strong
4509419 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4509420 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4509421 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4509422 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4509423 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4509424 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4509425 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4509426 of course they do and vint cerf wont like it
4509427 and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him
4509428 crucifeixes were erected and the worship of the people turned to these rather than to let them intelligently worship the lord jehovah and the lord jesus christ
4509429 for this reason god has highly exalted him and given him a name above every name and commands that all creature in heaven and earth shall worhip the son as he worships the father phil 2 5 11
4509430 jehovah enables his servants to understand his purpose in a progressive manner
4509431 how did jesus live a perfect life if he isnt jehovah god
4509432 is anyone other than jehovah able to live a perfect life

4509442 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
4509443 obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
4509444 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
4509445 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
4509446 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
4509447 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v wade that established abortion as a constitutional right he said he would have voted for a similar bill that passed the united states senate because it did not have the same constitutional flaw as the illinois bill
4509448 tells voters that he knows that what he did is not in synch with the american people
4509449 unbiased documentation showing that the committee voted 10 0 to adapt a neutrality clause then voted to kill the bill the smoking gun committee report is irrefutable evidence of what took place that day
4509450 we are saying that its not over until the fat lady sings were quite determined that we are going to do our best to sort it out
4509451 we share the shock and disappointment you must be feeling following the recent debate and decision of the general synod on provision for those opposed to the ordination of women to the episcopate in the church of england
4509452 it is now clear that the majority in this general synod and probably in the church of england at large believes it is right to admit women to the episcopate
4509453 if that is so it is vital for the most catholic of reasons that there must be no qualifications or restrictions to their ministry
4509454 that means however that proper ecclesial provision must be made for those who cannot accept this innovation
4509455 a code of practice in any form cannot deliver such ecclesial provision and we want the manchester group and the house of bishops to be in no doubt about the seriousness of the situation
4509456 struggle for the catholic identity of the church of england
4509457 however hard it is it is essential that we behave with grace and charity towards everyone
4509458 an enormous number of people are looking to us for leadership and it would be utterly unhelpful if the church of england did not cater for us
4509459 people say that its just a few clergymen making a fuss however its nothing of the kind
4509460 the church of england has materially changed its stance and we cant accept that
4509461 he signed the letter i think that bishop burnham has just said it in a different way
4509462 i think to say that the code of practice cant deliver is to pre empt the process we are all involved in
4509463 there was absolutely no hint during julys general synod debate that anyone wants all the traditionalists and anglo catholics to leave the church of england
4509464 twenty pound lies fairly seek no farther one to buy for ise take all thy barley twenty more shall purchase delight thy person i love so dearly if thou wilt lig by me all night and gang home in the morning early

4509481 his comments came a day after poland after appearing reticent on the plan in recent months suddenly announced it had reached an accord with the united states on plans to install us interceptor missiles on its territory
4509482 the timing of that announcement coming amid a burgeoning international crisis over the conflict between russia and georgia in the caucasus sparked a bellicose response from the russian military

4509502 it is unfortunate that britain and to some extent the eu has taken the position that in africa free and fair elections must be won by the opposition
4509503 you know you find in him the lasting connection between the struggle which the african fought to liberate themselves and the african way into the future especially now as they are struggling for economic emancipation
4509504 if this was a proper functioning democracy this government would have been kicked out long ago
4509505 i have always been a critic of government policy i was in government for more than five years before that i was a critic within the government i was a critic pushing for reform and always at odds with power brokers within the party
4509506 when i was in government it was routine for these cio agents and their factional counterparts in government and zanu pf politicians to abuse me as a scapegoat for anything they were unable to explain or defend
4509507 if there is one thing that no responsible zimbabwean can deny today it is that our country is in the throes of a devastating economic meltdown
4509508 that there were conflicting allegations on the situation in zimbabwe
4509509 there is no requirement that international observers must ensure anything of this sort its the voters that decide
4509510 i think if we look at what has happened in our country over the years since independence and if what we want to do is to find out whom mugabe really listens to disappointingly he does not really listen to free rational advice especially coming from outside the system but even within the system he does not listen to people either because they are cabinet ministers or they are politburo members or central committee members he ultimately and always consistently listens to his security people
4509511 his mugabe economic advisors are his security people his political advisors including who to appoint to cabinet who to appoint to central committee or politburo are his security people he is a security president and that explains why many responses of the government to economic challenges are predictable and they often take a law and order dimension
4509512 i think the other problem is that given what has happened in zimbabwe the paradox is despite mugabes so called anti imperialists rhetoric zimbabwe is now more vulnerable than ever to any future influences of international financial pressure
4509513 well i think his future is a key issue i dont think his presence in a future government is at all going to stabilize the situation but certainly his future is a key political question and given you know what professor moyo said about the securitisation of the state the state has become an increasing problem and will be a problem for any transition
4509514 the possibility of president mugabe facing all kinds of legal suits after office is something which plays heavily and regularly on the mind of his advisors and so we are now dealing with a president who will simply not leave office without trying to win certain safeguards regarding possibilities of prosecution whether within zimbabwe or internationally
4509515 mugabe operates like an opposition politician he does not accept the kind of conservative role or decision approach of a leader who has to balance different interests and so forth no he is very single minded and now he has had to discover only too late that the situation in zimbabwe is almost irretrievable and i see that he is concerned about his legacy
4509516 it becomes more a psychological debate than a political or economic debate but i think that itself explains why zanu pf and president mugabe have become very much preoccupied with their own survival rather than with the countrys survival and recovery
4509517 im sitting in a hotel room in germany in the middle of my summer tour with the tv news telling me that my home country is being torn to pieces
4509518 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before its never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
4509519 with the russians still being in gori there are reports that they have stopped fighting but you dont need to be killing a countrys people or its soldiers to paralyse it
4509520 you see gori is right in the middle of the only road that goes from west to east across georgia
4509521 its the road that my mum and brother need to travel on to catch their return flight out of tbilisi

4509548 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4509549 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4509550 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4509551 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4509552 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4509553 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4509554 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4509555 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4509556 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4509557 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4509558 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4509559 i know i speak for every american we are all georgians

4509563 voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000
4509564 youve got two different sets of standards here the standard you would use in journalism or scholarship and the standard you would use in a political campaign

4509566 a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program only one country iraq has used bentonite
4509567 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
4509568 the second phase of the war on terror is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made
4509569 if we are the richest country in the world how come so many of us cant afford to live here
4509570 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4509571 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4509572 when we take absolutist positions on abortion were not showing respect for the moral qualms many voters have weve got to bond emotionally with middle america show cultural empathy and not view these people as retrogrades or latent clinic bombers
4509573 if the 100 percenters referring to the abortion rights lobby keep insisting on total obedience they will end up dominating a party that will never again win a national election
4509574 moves the ball considerably toward the side that favors life from the moment of conception obama has successfully persuaded his party to commit to conditions that will make it more not less likely that a pregnant womans choice will be in favor of life
4509575 against a candidate like john mccain who doesnt like to talk about these issues
4509576 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out

4509594 my way or the highway arrogant little pissant who has so screwed up the countrys military with his bluster and bombast
4509595 my fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out no one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred many months of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead months in which both our patience and our will be tested months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers but the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards as all paths are but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world the cost of freedom is always high but americans have always paid it and one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and free mike d on aug 15 2008 11 34 am continued our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere and we hope around the world god willing that goal will be achieved

4509600 it is clear that the daily news case is political and has very little to do with the laws governing the countrys media the tragedy is that zimbabwe has been turned into a media desert

4509602 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues

4509604 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4509648 many travel videos show great places to visit but they seldom go into detail on what it took to get there
4509649 preparation and understanding on the many issues of international travel can build confidence and many times can make the difference in creating a wonderful travel experience

4509651 i just cant imagine doing anything like that to anybody
4509652 when they stuck the gun in the back of my head i didnt even hardly breathe i was so scared

4509655 when she got out she said you prayed that we would not kill you god answered your prayer and she said i think you must be a christian will you pray for me
4509656 pulmonary physicians are looking desperately for anything to improve the clinical course of patients with copd
4509657 this study is a much larger study and it does have some of the same flaws as the other studies mainly that some patients are not contributing any data on lung function in fact a large number
4509658 and because of that you cant really know thats why my editorial says theres some hopeful signs here but we cant really be conclusive
4509659 well why should we want to use all of these medications and especially the combination one
4509660 if the three drug therapies are giving exactly the same slope of decline the same improvement in slope of decline which one of the three should we choose
4509661 they should choose the safest one and thats the salmeterol by itself
4509662 it will alter my practice probably as of this afternoon when i go for a clinic to see a new copd patient
4509663 there is a slightly higher chance of pneumonia of getting an infection of the lung when you use the combination at least when you use either the inhaled corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids with the salmeterol
4509664 so yes there is a slight risk but it is relatively small and it does not affect mortality
4509665 the main finding is that for the first time its been shown that administering pharmacotherapy to patients with copd can change and modify the clinical course of their disease

4509667 to purchase possess transfer own carry transport sell or store any revolver pistol rifle or shotgun or any ammunition or ammunition components to be used therewith
4509668 you should not confuse carrying a firearm lawfully with committing a crime
4509669 we dont want there to be 200 different gun laws in the state and we want law abiding citizens to be able to defend themselves
4509670 martinsburg citizens dont want their tax dollars wasted on frivolous crap
4509671 nowhere in the ordinance does it say a person cant own a firearm on their personal property
4509672 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4509673 so compared to wednesday night nasri and kolo are back in the squad
4509674 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
4509675 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
4509676 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4509677 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile he is also very young the same age as cesc fabregas we now have a very young generation which can develop together
4509678 this is a massive club we strive to be the best we can and weve brought in some fantastic players
4509679 the reason is we are supposed to confirm identity with a photo id and it also helps confirm residency and that was the easiest way to do it
4509680 i know he is the vice president and i know he can vote but i wanted to make sure he can vote here and now

4509684 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4509685 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4509686 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4509687 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4509688 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4509689 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4509690 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4509691 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4509692 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4509693 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4509694 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4509695 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4509696 when the roads are wet this little bikes going to slide around

4509756 people who had to flee their homes come to our office i have to say that our work is very difficult and its very difficult too for these people who have obviously been under stress
4509757 many of them come to us because theyve lost contact with their loved ones and thats something were now working on helping them restore family links what might be coming soon and its obvious theres a need for that is psycho social assistance to the displaced population
4509758 we went down to the basement after the fighting started we spent three days there in the dark without either water or bread among us was a 4 month old baby a pregnant woman elderly people children
4509759 we sat there in anguish while heavy artillery was being fired we didnt even see the light of day then someone came from another building and told us that a humanitarian corridor had opened and that we should run for our lives
4509760 we ran out and what we saw was terrible all the houses were destroyed schools and buildings were ablaze
4509761 now we are being sent here and there but well probably go back to our native city even if the houses are in ruins well build a shack and live in it and help our people
4509762 the first thing we did was to feed people at the monasterys gates this went on for the whole time the sisters got almost no sleep now we are working hard on redistributing all the aid that is brought to the monastery
4509763 at the beginning there were mostly women and children but now there are very old people whom i dont how to look in the eye after living their lives building their houses at age 70 or 80 they have to leave for unfamiliar places
4509764 several of the citys residential districts are severely damaged government buildings suffered extensive damaged we saw traces of strikes aimed at basements in which people were hiding and were then trapped for several days we saw houses whose basement walls had been breached by armored personnel carriers
4509765 we saw undeniable signs that the grad missile system a nonprecision weapon was used there is no doubt whatsoever that the rights of tskhinvalis civilian population were severely violated
4509766 we were told that 273 injured people were brought to this hospital from tskhinvali and its outskirts concerning the number of dead the number cited was 44 south ossetian residents
4509767 doctors are positive that all the south ossetians killed were brought to this hospital they are convinced that the number of dead is not much higher otherwise they would know about it
4509768 it was very tough they started threatening us and expelled our daughter from school they threatened to either kill us or blow up the school they smashed the windows of the school thats in the russian sector they started dragging us out of our flats our rooms

4509811 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4509812 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service

4509838 political correctness and multiculturalism are defunct ideas from the 80s and dont exist in academics anymore its ridiculous for any intelligent academic to bring up such nonsense it simply does not exist in the real world of the college we teach a standardized canon in the college today as it always has been and anyone who tries to bring up pc is merely trying to discredit our tradition of inquiry and research thats just some misguided bitter clinging to an outdated past of old dead white guys only when the department has rightly progressed to a higher more expansive level

4509846 the bikes sure are different now the ride was surprisingly smooth
4509847 the last thing any organization wants to do is lay off employees
4509848 it was one of those things that was a really tough decision to make but the longer you wait the deeper the cuts could have been
4509849 as we move forward we will have to assess things
4509850 we are communicating that this is an option that could affect their benefits
4509851 we will be working individually with each employee to make that determination

4509863 we happily congratulate dahal for being elected the prime minister of the republic of nepal this had to happen four months ago when the maoist emerged as the single largest party
4509864 we appeal to all parties including the nepali congress which together fought for establishment of the republic to cooperate in order to consolidate this process by adopting a properly deliberated republican constitution
4509865 in their struggle for a better future with a more representative and inclusive republican polity
4509866 it all depends upon usage of course and thats one of the reasons we wanted to alert our customers now we want them to have time to start making whatever preparations they can to save on natural gas usage and therefore the cost this winter
4509867 this represents an increase of about 20 to 30 percent over last years heating season
4509868 a bright spot in our outlook is the fact that natural gas prices have somewhat stabilized in recent weeks we are cautiously optimistic that the most significant increases in the price of natural gas for this year are behind us
4509869 my savings thats what its there for a rainy day
4509870 with the number of unemployed individuals increasing by one third since april the effects of national economic turmoil on the illinois job market are painstakingly clear
4509871 was disappointed to see that again the national economic crunch has weighed heavily on industries critical to illinois economy
4509872 we cannot afford to wait any longer for new jobs
4509873 legislators should be ashamed for not moving forward with this
4509874 this comes at a time when the governor says businesses arent paying their fair share
4509875 but businesses carry 52 percent of all taxes in the state those dollars could be better invested reinvested in companies and employees
4509876 the significant increase in revenue for the second quarter was a direct result of the growing demand from brand advertisers for gofishs coveted target audience immersive advertising products and turnkey solutions
4509877 we believe that leading national brand advertisers are increasingly underserved in digital media
4509878 since the launch of our network only six months ago gofish has undergone tremendous growth we believe we have the right people technology and foresight in place to continue our growth and are confident that we will reach our full year revenue guidance

4509882 they have tested me four times and took a lot of blood
4509883 im saying they are taking so much blood i might be very weak for the saturday finals of the 100 metres
4509884 they do it quite often because there are different agencies that can test you so they may overlap
4509885 i dont know if it can weaken you basically pardon my language you take a leak and its not like they draw a half litre of blood i think its just annoying more than anything because the testing methods are different from culture to culture
4509886 we barely got off the plane in singapore and they were all over us three korean gentlemen and they were very aggressive and it can be quite unpleasant they said its random but the people randomly chosen were highly ranked 400m man tyler christopher 800m medal possibility gary reed shotputter dylan armstrong and lopes hurdler priscilla lopes schliep so obviously its one of those random things thats not totally random id like to be able to pick the lottery number that randomly i wouldnt be sitting here for very long
4509887 the people who will test positive here in my opinion theres something wrong with the medical professionals theyre working with or just dont have enough money to use something thats still working
4509888 you know theres still a couple of designer drugs out there that are probably undetectable
4509889 its a political issue i dont think i ought to comment specifically but there are certain pockets of society still who support winning at all costs and the moral ethical issues havent changed in some parts of the world about what winning really means plus its a really good living
4509890 i understand that because past champions tested positive for drugs the olympic champion does have to be clean and then to be able to prove it
4509891 it is kind of surreal it is a feeling that leaves me elated the one thing while doing khatron ke khiladi was that the journey should be fantastic and it has been just that

4509896 i had an experience with a yorkshire terrier that was given bacon every morning for breakfast
4509897 anything greasy fatty or salty is not good the dog would end up skipping meals waiting on the bacon
4509898 its just like with humans animals dont need them because there is no real benefit
4509899 i feel it leads to a lot of problems health and behavioral problems
4509900 one serving of bacon is like a weeks worth for them
4509901 they do what works and if it doesnt work they dont do it

4509903 psychologists need to examine the attitudes and behaviors in the wider context of beliefs about environmental and social change
4509904 this was especially true for respondents who described themselves as democrats and those who said they trusted scientists
4509905 but for republicans and those who had little trust in scientists more knowledge did not mean there was more concern

4509913 some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek justice
4509914 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4509915 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute

4509926 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
4509927 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
4509928 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
4509929 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
4509930 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
4509931 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
4509932 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
4509933 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
4509934 all the great cultures have left the stage of history
4509935 the romans the greeks the egyptians the babylonians but this little people who gave so much to the world do not
4509936 the motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims if you become part of the victim community you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community
4509937 shear yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past
4509938 there were no jews in these stories and no nazis in these stories
4509939 no no there were no nazis we are not nazis we didnt know any jews we didnt know anything
4509940 people said now we have closed the circle now everything is fine
4509941 it was like nothing had happened but there were 11 000 jews in munich before the holocaust where are they now
4509942 because i was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed
4509943 there is something not right when you do it to get rid of your german burden
4509944 that is not honest in my eyes do you stop being the daughter of a wehrmacht soldier if you are jewish no that is no solution you dont get rid of it
4509945 to live here to work here to be this bridge between two worlds
4509946 that is another way of saying what i have already told you
4509947 they want to join the community of the victim they may have their own way of rationalising it
4509948 i was always looking for my place i hated catholicism i have hated it since i was 14
4509949 what counts is the deed in christianity it is enough just to believe
4509950 i didnt think of my family of being like the germans
4509951 you went in the classroom twice a week they told you you fell asleep
4509952 she was 13 she says she remembered there were jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss because she said you could always go to the jews and buy something and if you didnt have the money you could bring it in next time
4509953 i feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when i go back i have to force myself to melt down again
4509954 but it is not the way to work through the role of the parents in the war i think it is running away from it in order to be able to really work through the past you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer you have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things
4509955 being in israel is to keep away as far as possible from it
4509956 i am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into israeli society i think they are struggling i dont envy them
4509957 you are not here to speak to me you are here to speak to my girlfriend
4509958 i met some who surprised me some of them were shockingly unintelligent i even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice especially the people who chose to be ultra orthodox who chose to throw away their freedom
4509959 i was worried i would get hurt by information i didnt want to know
4509960 sometimes i feel that a lot of israelis live that way it is better not to ask questions and not be hurt and so you dont have to look at yourself or your family or your nation and you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad
4509961 i heard a boy next door call another boy a stupid jew
4509962 i asked my mother what is a jew and is it something bad
4509963 i was physically disgusted and i was totally disgusted by even my own germanness
4509964 and because this entered my mind so early it became as natural as brushing my teeth
4509965 i felt that i was being told that to be a good jew you had to hate arabs
4509966 it causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that i say
4509967 because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something and then to come here and not speak up for justice
4509968 dont think i havent thought about it in those terms myself
4509969 i had wanted to connect myself to a history i did not perceive as shameful now i am wondering if i will stay i am more or less sure that i wont sometimes i feel i am not built for it that i am not strong enough for this country
4509970 sometimes i feel that just by existing i am always wrong here but i cannot live with personal attacks now i cannot bear it
4509971 on the condition that you do not print my name
4509972 hans married my grandmother erna after she divorced my grandfather
4509973 i have neither any blood nor dna from adolf and his family
4509974 but i always appreciated that she told me the truth about it we spoke frankly i never heard that normal german lie you hear so often from that generation
4509975 she became one of those german ladies who cleared up after all the bombing
4509976 that is all that my mother brought home from the war i keep them to honour her
4509977 i saw my father very seldom and the times i saw him i was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war he died when i was 19 so i never asked him what he did
4509978 it was not a sudden light from heaven that came down
4509979 how could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this its awful
4509980 i dont think you can really understand how awful it is if you dont read it in german i put it away but i keep it here
4509981 you raise up an army if you think you have to use it
