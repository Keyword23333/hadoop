2120066 women have to choose between being liked but not respected or respected but not liked
2120067 some of what we are learning is directly helpful and tells women that they are acting in ways they might not even be aware of and that is harming them and they can change

2120071 riverkeeper agrees with the states decision to update its outdated environmental review for gas drilling in new yorks portion of the vast marcellus shale formation the state must take the logical next step and enact a ban on gas drilling in the nyc watershed
2120072 the state must honor its commitment in the moa to protect this critical resource which supplies half the states population with unfiltered drinking water on a daily basis it is our duty to safeguard this water supply for all current and future generations

2120140 almost everyone in industrialised countries uses paper every day but we have become careless for example 65 of print outs and photocopies many of which could be read on screen land in the bin before the end of the day and junk mail and catalogues are clogging our mailboxes
2120141 paper production and use is directly linked to grave negative impacts on forests biodiversity on water resources on the global climate and on human rights through irresponsible producers all of us can help to change this starting today by making a pledge on shrinkpaper org
2120142 responsible paper production practices are necessary and possible but we also need to tackle our careless and wasteful consumption people in developed countries are using way more than their share while children in developing countries do not have paper to write on or books to read
2120143 unnecessarily huge volumes of paper are distributed by large corporations as packaging mailings and publications so we are asking some of the biggest paper users to commit to reducing their paper footprint our aim is to generate a society wide understanding of the need to cut wasteful paper use and to help both big and small consumers to take action to make real reductions
2120144 making 1kg of paper requires 98kg of other resources uses vast amounts of energy and water and causes pollution almost half 42 of all industrially logged timber is pulped to make paper products much of it sourced from old growth and other endangered and high conservation value forests the paper industrys climate change emissions including forest impacts production transportation and disposal are more than three times those of global aviation europeans use four times as much paper as the global average so we are responsible for a disproportionate share of those impacts we must use less paper
2120145 in addition to problems created for biodiversity the paper industry also has negative social impacts so saving paper is also an ethical issue
2120146 in some cases deforestation or chemical emissions by the pulp and paper industry endanger peoples livelihoods and have negative impacts on the health well being and stability of local communities in some areas forests or other natural ecosystems are being cleared for conversion to plantations with limited ecological value employing toxic chemical herbicides and fertilisers and with devastating consequences for local people
2120147 by using paper more efficiently companies and individuals can cut paper purchases and related costs such as toner storage handling time and disposal so as well as the environmental and social benefits of saving paper it can also save money

2120214 amway has grown from 6 1 to 7 billion usd without you
2120215 nobody makes decision about their life by reading a blog
2120216 i am not shy to give you my level in business i am an emerald making 100 thousand dollars a year as commision do you
2120217 remember amway is a 7 2 billion company now working in 93 countries fortune 500 company biggest market is china 450 world class products 600 patents started in 1959
2120218 voila youre an active ibo average income 1380 yr pretty damn good income for asking your brother a question dont you think
2120219 ive never heard of it so therefore it hasnt happened
2120220 diamonds falling out diamonds quitting the evidence is on my side
2120221 you here have equated the occasional visit to a strip club with the kind of stuff joecool was doing by his own words you clearly havent read the stuff i suggest you either do so and understand what youre talking about or better drop the topic at all at stop with bs talking points youve been fed
2120222 wow hitting kids and using women in illegal brothels for sex is no worse than sex outside marriage
2120223 ive had emails from people who know him so ive more than just his name
2120224 people buy and sell and move on to other businesses all the time in the non amway world if you thought there was a better option for you elsewhere why would you stay with amway
2120225 the fact he lies on his quixtar blog is relevant
2120226 yup its not illegal though which folk often claim and which i challenge
2120227 i have a beef with them as well they give the business and industry a bad name i also have a beef with critics who claim or assume that the entire or even majority of amway operates this way i particular have a beef with folk who claim i operate that way
2120228 others of course walk away because there businesses arent generating residual income
2120229 believe me if you actually went and read what hed written on the wsg site which i dont recommend then its definitely a slam dunk
2120230 if you have been in the business and following the system for a year or nearly a year and you are not platinum or close to platinum chances are you will never reach the platinum level or higher
2120231 although the amway quixtar business is not a game of chance you can compare it to the experience of many ibos who participated in an aqmo system
2120232 everything you do in amway is up to you and can effect your likelihood of success to compare it to a game of chance is outright dishonest
2120233 its true i am close to signing a deal to write a book but everyone should hold on i have lots of stories ive never told and they will all be in my book

2120237 a resumption of the war in mindanao and sulu as radical elements in the moro islamic liberation front and the abu sayyaf raise the ante by making demands on the manila government that they know the manila government cannot accede to
2120238 president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured
2120239 but there would also be the possibility of a military takeover on or before 2010 precisely to prevent president arroyo from staying in power beyond 2010
2120240 in both scenarios martial law by president arroyo or military takeover on or before 2010 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
2120241 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
2120242 so even under my best case scenario i do not think there will be presidential elections in 2010

2120248 when i was 11 or 12 i remember once reading a book called something like 50 things you can do for the planet or something and i remember trying to do each and every one of them
2120249 recycling and making my own paper for instance which didnt work too well you couldnt write on it it was a clump of mushy paper but the thought was there
2120250 you see things change over time and you want to make things better for the future for society

2120252 i met her when she was still jasmin dayrit right after i founded bawt bay area wilderness training at an environmental educational event in marin
2120253 she was a member of a youth panel and when i called for people to help in my work she stepped up and became involved
2120254 she became a founding board member and that was 10 years ago
2120255 its not a stretch to say she was a pivotal person in an organization that has so far served 6 000 youth
2120256 with her youthful energy and intelligence shes really helped solve problems and get people involved
2120257 i work with projects that come straight from city council and not everyone gets to do that
2120258 in five years i still see myself working for the city and i hope to have a bigger presence in the city of vallejo in environmental things

2120282 el mercat de santa caterina ha tingut sempre problemes de refrigeraci ja que va ser pensat com un espai obert tot i que posteriorment es van haver de gastar un mili deuros per fer el tancament
2120283 des de ciu creiem que el govern municipal no pot continuar fent mercats que signifiquin unes quantitat tant elevades de diners i en canvi despr s els nous en algunes coses no funcionen i tamb hi hagi encara molts mercats que estan pendents de les m s petites remodelacions i que quant aquestes es fan es pensa m s en lest tica i en ensenyar les als turistes que no en les activitats que han dacollir
2120284 s una hero citat per la calor que hi fa

2120310 in the current deregulated telecommunications market our government has no intention of interfering with the day to day business decisions of private companies or with the choices available to consumers
2120311 given these undertakings by bell mobility and telus i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2120312 ten years ago the government used a similar charge of sodomy against anwar ibrahim and kept him in jail for six years the conviction was ultimately overturned
2120313 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
2120314 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them
2120315 its fair for the malaysian people and the international community to judge the malaysian governments respect for the rule of law based on how they proceed with this case
2120316 while my speech continues to improve it is not yet 100 percent and i have not yet reached a point in my rehab where my participation in a debate would accurately reflect my capabilities
2120317 therefore i will not participate in traditional political debates during this campaign
2120318 but there is financial incentive for giles to approve a trade in addition to the 9 million he is being paid this season he gets 2 million if hes traded his contract has a club option for 2009 which pays him 9 million or 11 million if he is dealt there is also a 3 million buyout on the option the money and the chance to play for a team in a pennant race would seem to be the big enticement for giles to waive his no trade clause as it wouldnt be playing time

2120326 the first thing is it sends a positive message that the chances of success spontaneously are pretty convincing
2120327 these treatments are cheap but common if you total all the money time and effort spent on them its considerable
2120328 it is very important that we have a strong evidence base to support the treatments that are offered to infertile couples and as such this study is very valuable
2120329 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely
2120330 today s young people will bear the consequences of climate change thanks to the unfortunate legacy of their elders in many developing countries in particular youth especially girls and young women are often responsible for farming finding water and collecting fuel wood these tasks will be rendered more difficult and will take even more time away from education or productive activities as climate change affects the availability of water agricultural productivity and the survival of ecosystems
2120331 weve entered into an agreement with roustans company to help manage the club not the hockey on the ice but the business side of things

2120334 this placement of domestic helpers at homes in seberang takir will be the pilot project and it would expanded to all homes once fine tuned

2120350 weve evaluated the candidates in this race and at the end of the day we believe senator parker has the most experience
2120351 senator parkers support of the middle class has been unwavering he has been a leader on education immigration alternative energy policies and healthcare senator parker has proven he will fight for brooklyn and he will continue to deliver for brooklyn and all new yorkers when democrats take the majority in the senate this november
2120352 we still need representatives who understand that our schools and teachers represent the future of our city and state senator parker is a reliable vote for fair and basic education funding and with democrats in the majority we know that new york citys kids will continue to receive more funding and better future
2120353 too many brooklyn residents are struggling to hold on to their homes and many would be homeowners are now struggling to get approval to renovate or to buy their first home i am proud to support my friend kevin parker for re election because he has been a leader in holding predatory lenders accountable
2120354 senator parker has a special appreciation for people who come to america seeking a better life and does everything he can to ensure they are treated fairly and justly under the law
2120355 the republicans have been in office for a long time and new york city residents have paid the price with higher taxes underfunded schools and rising healthcare and transportation costs

2120373 local community based wind projects lower costs to the ratepayers keep our energy dollars inside minnesota and move us toward meeting the states renewable electricity standard
2120374 the study found that 600 mw of dispersed community based wind projects could be integrated across minnesota into the existing grid system with no additional costs for transmission
2120375 this study points clearly towards a major shift in electric utility management
2120376 the old way of doing business was to hook up a few very large central station power plants mostly coal and nuclear to high voltage powerlines to serve energy consumers in distant cities the new way as this study documents is to serve those same energy consumers by strategically locating smaller locally owned dispersed renewable energy facilities
2120377 this dispersed generation siting strategy has the potential to allow numerous new renewable generation projects to interconnect to the grid and not be constrained by transmission bottlenecks such as those now existing on buffalo ridge
2120378 no longer can old conventional central station electric utility thinking claim to provide the cheapest most reliable electric utility services in the new paradigm
2120379 utility services will be delivered increasingly by cleaner cheaper more reliable more secure and more equitable renewable energy projects owned by ordinary people in communities around the state with the energy delivered through smart grids rather than dumb powerlines

2120444 the problems associated with batteries are growing rapidly in line with the increasing demands on batteries as vehicles become ever more reliant upon them for all manner of tasks
2120445 unfortunately many new vehicles experience battery discharge prior to delivery to the customer resulting in a short term problem immediately thereafter and the customer feeling that there is a more significant problem with the vehicle similarly if a vehicle is not used for a few days or only used on short journeys the battery can become discharged leading to the expense of a replacement battery or callout charge given these problems can be simply and cost effectively resolved with regular maintainance many consumers are choosing to add a smart charger to their essential garage maintenance kit

2120491 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2120514 legislators in washington have another tool to confront the climate crisis according to a new report released today on united nations world environment day
2120515 recycling is as important for climate stability as improving vehicle fuel efficiency retrofitting lighting planting trees and protecting forests
2120516 by avoiding landfill methane emissions composting in particular is a vital tactic in the battle to stop artic ice melting biodegradable materials are a liability when buried and burned but an asset when composted
2120517 in reality incinerators and landfills are bad for the climate
2120518 these disposal systems gobble up taxpayer money to encourage more of the same garbage they compete against wind and solar projects while burdening local communities with pollution and debt
2120519 incinerators and landfills are relics of an unsustainable past that have no place in our green economy
2120520 a zero waste approach is not only good news for climate stability its also good news for americas businesses and economy
2120521 on a per ton basis recycling sustains ten times the number of jobs as landfills and incinerators the time to act is now we cannot afford to pass up this opportunity to create local jobs and new enterprises while reducing global warming and our reliance on imported goods and fuels
2120522 are as relevant today as they were when first introduced in the 1970s today we call this approach the zero waste path and include composting product redesign and manufacturer product responsibility
2120523 landfills and incinerators rank with gasoline powered cars and coal burning power plants as major american infrastructure dinosaurs that must be changed from coast to coast and quickly

2120544 we didnt do anything wrong we were speaking up for the chinese people we refused to pay
2120545 lets face it china doesnt have a very good record on human rights its very troubling when you dont hear from someone in 24 hours
2120546 we pray that this oppressive government will perhaps recognize through this incident that their own citizens deserve to have the basic human rights of free speech freedom to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience as well as the protection of the weakest members of society their precious unborn children
2120547 i say china the eyes of the world are upon you if you want the respect and acceptance of other nations at this critical time during the olympics afford your own wonderful people the human rights they have been yearning for

2120551 most of the cop resolutions will increase hunger especially in southern countries
2120552 accepting genetically engineered trees is only one more in the chain of wrong policies that will worsen the already serious hunger situation millions of hectares of land are being turned over to the production of agrofuels with the new emphasis on cellulose based agrofuels even more land will be taken for even larger plantations of trees which will likely someday be ge trees since the cop would not pass a moratorium on them business has been pushing these unsustainable agrofuels all through this cop which are only for the benefit of transnational corporations at the expense of human hunger and environmental destruction
2120553 the fact that the cop failed to take strong collective action against ge trees means that more forests will be destroyed more biodiversity devastated and more peoples displaced
2120554 under the leadership of cbd executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf the cbd has chosen to actively embrace business and a market based approach to biodiversity conservation which has had the inevitable effect of watering down protection of biodiversity where it runs counter to the interests of business it is having the effect of seriously jeopardizing the legitimacy of this body

2120562 the court understands the potential hurt and embarrassment that may result from lifting the seal on the letters
2120563 despite the courts reluctance to unveil what were clearly intended to be private thoughts the provisions of the state and federal constitutions compel the court to remove the seal from the letters
2120564 in order to avoid a potentially needless intrusion into a familys privacy the letters will remain under seal until after the period for appeal of this ruling has passed
2120565 should the court allow public access to a mental health evaluation under the theory that evaluation does not constitute treatment for the purposes of the statutory protections governing doctor patient communications that interpretation of evaluation would lay bare to public scrutiny an entire category of previously confidential communications

2120584 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2120585 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2120586 why is secretary mike leavitt kowtowing to birth control companies and abortion activists
2120587 if he is seeking to protect conscience rights of those who want nothing to do with abortion he needs to recognize that contraceptives can cause abortions
2120588 the truth is that life begins at creation and anything that destroys that life is an abortion
2120589 we hope mr leavitt will have the courage to stand for truth against abortion advocates

2120638 my most creative workout with kids was hauling all three of them in a sled tethered to my waist we went all over the neighborhood on a snowy day it was quite a workout and left me feeling pretty empowered as a fit mom
2120639 women have been brainwashed into thinking theyre not strong enough not physically capable of bearing children and then we perpetuate that myth amongst ourselves we we are capable we are strong enough but we need support we need to be told birth is nothing to fear we need to be reminded of our strength of our power of our confidence in our body

2120674 there is a report coming from bmw about what happened there but the rumour is they havent a clue why it happened they have no idea and that is a worry
2120675 you only need to think about what would happen if someone gets shocked into the fast lane of the pitlane
2120676 it is like a plane crash when you dont get the evidence
2120677 its flavour of the month but the simple fact is teams will get on top of it if you look at the electronic systems they are fairly standard technology which is why people are going for them rather than some of the more involved mechanical type systems that do pose a lot of problems
2120678 the fact is we will get on top of them quickly as soon as one person does the nature of formula one means everyone else has to things like the incident with bmw im sure they are working to understand it but i dont think thatll cause problems it should be straightforward
2120679 certainly the electronic kers were looking at is a fully sealed unit all the high tension cables are within a sealed unit its difficult to see how you can have a problem
2120680 i dont mind saying that our budget for kers is ten percent of our budget for aerodynamics and composite parts so its not a huge amount of money and we see it as a fantastic investment into the future of the sport
2120681 when you are looking at the improvements we are talking about with the suspension they are difficult to quantify
2120682 if you get the dampers working a bit better you know it is better but how much lap time or how much consistency does that really mean it is difficult to quantify so it will be interesting to see how it all works
2120683 this system has not been fully optimised because we havent done enough rig testing on it in the august break we have got some time on rigs to really scan it properly and tune it properly for valencia
2120684 some of it was for the reorganised group to take on a reasonable sized project before we got into the new car
2120685 we got some new management in the company and we also got a new cad system so it was good to have a sizeable project to tax the system because we could not afford to discover operational issues
2120686 it is still a fairly heavy compromise in terms of what we have had to achieve within the constraints of the gearbox
2120687 if that suspension philosophy was designed from scratch it would not be as heavy as it has turned out to be as we have had to compromise
2120688 are you kidding me this thing is so smooth its easy to forget youre in an exotic sports car the cabin is quiet and the ride quality silky with the r8 you dont need a separate everyday commuter car this audi is as comfortable as virtually any sports sedan out there
2120689 i really like it it may border on sacrilege but the r8 reminds me of a german version of the acura nsx what with its sewing machine like engine behind the driver i also like the low cowl and generous interior space
2120690 im very grateful to have this one off opportunity with signature

2120697 president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured
2120698 but there would also be the possibility of a military takeover on or before 2010 precisely to prevent president arroyo from staying in power beyond 2010
2120699 in both scenarios martial law by president arroyo or military takeover on or before 2010 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
2120700 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
2120701 so even under my best case scenario i do not think there will be presidential elections in 2010

2120724 i went to bed on wednesday night thinking about my career options but when i woke up thursday morning i was convinced i wanted to stay with my guys at agr
2120725 i decided to stay with agr and 7 eleven and its a good contract that should be my last one in indy cars
2120726 i talked to him kanaan on wednesday night and he said we were fine we were great and were a go
2120727 basically the ferrari has more of a tendency to understeer than the mclaren
2120728 the mclaren is a little bit oversteery when the tyre has good grip the car with the oversteer tendency will be quicker over a single lap than a neutral or understeering car
2120729 but when you think about racing conditions especially with the temperatures we had at the hungaroring then an oversteering car will have heat generating at the rear much higher than the understeering car
2120730 looking at hungary and lewis hamiltons car behaviour after a few laps he struggled with oversteer so he was making lots of counter steering movements on the other hand the ferrari had a good balance after a few laps
2120731 jj is a talented driver and a great person and this was a difficult decision to make
2120732 we all share responsibility that our performance hasnt been what it needs to be but we concluded it was time to make a change
2120733 this is a performance based industry and we need to perform better were confident j j will be successful in this sport in whatever his next challenge is
2120734 i have really enjoyed my time testing with the people on the team and im looking forward to having a successful weekend at michigan in the dlp hdtv toyota and helping hall of fame racing finish the season as strong as possible
2120735 it is truly an honor to be a part of this organization
2120736 i feel like were always a factor at both race tracks but if you look at the history it seems like if we dont win at sonoma then we normally will follow it up with a really good run at watkins glen
2120737 if you look at the records were definitely a factor in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2120738 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time
2120739 its not like were not running well because we are
2120740 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way we tend to be a late blooming team anyhow we plan on doing the same thing we do every week were not changing our approach
2120741 every week our goal is to win the race and thats not going to change
2120742 bernie ecclestone will get sick of melbournes refusal to host a night race

2120759 its all about staying patient for the first three days and i need to get my head around that
2120760 the breeze was blowing the fairways were firm and it was really tough to keep the ball in play on the fairways
2120761 a few may have only to walk down the road and sell their produce for a lower price than people are paying
2120762 under a cloud of uncertainty its in a shadow world where we dont know whats going on
2120763 on the surface is picking up in terms of business and institutions even though there are very few tourists
2120764 but from information leaking out very slowly there are a significant number of people who have disappeared or are in prison
2120765 the surge of world food prices this year came like a bolt out of the blue but warning lights were in fact flashing imbalances of global food supply and demand had been building for years beneath the public view
2120766 neither side wants to show that it is losing face or that it is caving in or appeasing the other side but both sides are interested in finding a way out of this conundrum
2120767 the more iranians see the real america rather than the propaganda version portrayed in their reactionary media the more they will push for democratic rights at home and moderate behavior abroad this is where our diplomats come in the main purpose of sending them to iran would be to simplify travel for iranians to the united states
2120768 beijing has stepped up its campaign to make tibetans denounce the dalai lama
2120769 this is good for the democratic party because when john kerry waltzed into the nomination and then ran into george bush he did not know what hit him when they started the negative campaigning against him and he who was the war hero got painted as the coward
2120770 in his ceaseless effort to maintain his record as the worst president on the environment since the creation of the epa in 1970 president george w bush has somehow managed to outdo himself with his latest rose garden pronouncement on climate change
2120771 they were demanding specific changes on religious restrictions in the monastery
2120772 youre not going to find anybody in the republican party who doesnt think hes a mensch a man of his word a guy you can trust in a negotiation
2120773 when he became minority leader it was the first time he could get democrats to the table before that they were completely ignored
2120774 the problem is we dont know when this behavior started for this person
2120775 politicians are like the rest of us the fact that theyre flawed and do stupid things shouldnt surprise us
2120776 these past days showed that a radicalization of the positions by the parties involved in the conflict are not in the interest of peace
2120777 public private partnerships are now one sided arrangements in which the public actors no longer plan public spaces in the public interest
2120778 as long as castro is alive he will still be a major influence on cuba
2120779 castros not dead so if something happens and he decides to protest it which could happen that would be very serious
2120780 theres huge evidence that if you get malaria under control you not only save more than one million lives a year but you change everything else
2120781 unproven technologies such as capture and storage of carbon and hybrid cars may help achieve affordable cuts in carbon emissions that would slow climate change
2120782 are so promising though not yet proved that ultimately the solution is going to be vastly lower cost than imagined now
2120783 his political and personal issues were not going to wear well
2120784 clinton has a decade and a half of experience and ties to prominent latinos in the regions where most latinos live obama has just two years in national public office and a political base in the midwest for the majority of latinos it is the political calculus of long established relationships combined with early outreach and the support of community influentials that are most likely to carry the day
2120785 it seems like every mayor because theyre in this media center people say they should run for president of course no new york city mayor has ever gone on to higher office its something mayor giuliani is discovering right now
2120786 the tax cut plan should also help the mayor politically
2120787 even as the surge of us troops has calmed fighting in iraq the war itself is heating up the american election in unexpected ways it is not only the wisdom of war or its tragic execution that is at issue but also whether and how america should extricate itself from that war torn country
2120788 president george w bushs eight day middle east tour accomplished very little he tried to rally the troops to his policy and i think it had very little affect
2120789 the fact that it comes a couple of days before the president sets off on his trip raises questions
2120790 this is among the best books and certainly the most comprehensive study of the indian economy since independence it is a valuable addition to the libraries of people interested in understanding the past present and future of the indian economy
2120791 there is considerable evidence reported in a recent national academy of sciences study and elsewhere that ex offenders who are able to get and keep a job are less likely to return to prison they have a good deal of trouble doing it on their own but much less with the assistance of a variety of community based programs
2120792 depending on the nominees thats where hed get his rationale for his own run
2120793 many of todays war zones including afghanistan iran iraq pakistan and sudan share some basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts they are all poor buffeted by natural disasters and have rapidly growing populations that are pressing on the capacity of the land to feed them
2120794 i think the adjustment of the dollar to date is understandable i think its appropriate i think on balance its stabilizing for the global economy
2120795 my starting point is a sigh of relief that were on the right track the fact that there is a bali action plan is an important development
2120796 gun control is an emotional issue in america that has divided urban and rural voters
2120797 irans rulers are following a strategy very much like that of the shah
2120798 putin managed to play on the resentment that russians everywhere were feeling
2120799 giulianis welfare people matched the city data with the state department of labor data and basically found that people were working already
2120800 so they found fraud sent out letters people left the rolls and they were instantly employed weeding out fraud is an inarguable achievement but giuliani makes it sound as if he also created a robust job program
2120801 the donors took away the role of the government and the disasters mounted
2120802 the biggest problem for him if you look at the new york papers today its all pictures of rudy and judi in the hamptons
2120803 im sure thats not what he wants to see in the press right now while hes pushing his campaign
2120804 i would never assume that because he is consulting with someone he is necessarily going to follow that person
2120805 the problems with poverty estimates go well beyond the inappropriate nature of the conversion factors used to make such adjustments across currencies and ultimately reside in the failure to specify an international poverty line that are meaningful in the sense that they correspond to the real cost of achieving basic human requirements
2120806 it wasnt done in rudys first term it was done over the course of twenty five years of people working to rebuild what had fallen apart
2120807 the change in mindset about the use of the dollar in reserves and the movement of the dollar out of the reserves will continue to exert downward pressure
2120808 you cant expect people with no money to buy bed nets
2120809 to ensure a chance at a fair election imedi tv would have to be allowed to broadcast as an independent station
2120810 washington has long run a risk by betting everything on musharraf making him the center of u s security strategy in the region that strategy could backfire if the situation in pakistan spins out of control
2120811 youre going to hear a lot about taxes over the next two years some of the things you hear will be true others will be less true a dirty little secret is that the corporate income tax used to raise a fair amount of revenue says richard clarida a columbia university economist and former treasury department official under mr bush
2120812 he has appeared very domestically oriented whereas she appears much more prone to talk to the outside world and to engage other people in conversation
2120813 releasing intelligence estimates increases the likelihood their contents will be used for political rather than foreign policy purposes and influences how they are worded
2120814 it will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up
2120815 and they very well might especially if hes the front runner
2120816 a slowdown in the u s economy may be prolonged as a house price drop cuts off a source of funding for consumers
2120817 the average price of housing in the u s is already falling
2120818 that will be a big problem for the u s and if it is a problem for the u s its going to be a big problem for the global economy
2120819 that the city and upstate economies are so different that the city should be allowed to set its own standards to make the energy planning workable
2120820 i think it is a big question for china that there seems to be a continuing inability to gauge how tibetans think and how to win them over
2120821 they need to get over the idea that you can buy peoples loyalty by improving the economy and improving cities and so on it just isnt working out for them
2120822 the seeming spike in noose hangings have come at a crucial time when americans are grappling with anxiety about immigrants of color and a growing economic disparity
2120823 i believe there are many places that are in or on the edge of conflict because of climate change already and this prize is a warning that on our current trajectory of climate change the risk will get worse these will be the conflicts of the 21st century
2120824 it is a good thing to have competition in most markets including the market for development lending
2120825 it is our obligation at sipa to give our students the broadest possible variety of views mahmoud ahmadinejads views must be challenged and challenged in a forum that will allow him no recourse but to respond with reason logic and facts
2120826 growth is very strong though not as strong as the 10 of china and india
2120827 if one can get broad based sustained growth of 5 to 6 there is no reason why you cant go up the next tier
2120828 terrorism should be fought first with information exchanges and law enforcement
2120829 ought to be pursued tried and convicted in the courts
2120830 it is unclear whether these republicans have abandoned the republican party for good or whether they do not want to be labeled republican when they talk to pollsters
2120831 the turbulence in the u s subprime mortgage market could spread to other sectors in the economy especially as growth momentum is already weak
2120832 the risks could spread to sectors wider than the subprime but how wide is difficult to tell its a broad problem
2120833 paramilitarism in columbia has been more then just an umbrella of blood thirsty right wing armed groups the phenomenon is a much deeper one it is the expression of corrupt regional political and economic elites who have been infiltrating regional and national democratic institutions according to recent studies between 1999 and 2003 the paramilitaries have transformed the political map of 12 departments of columbia
2120834 i applaud colliers excellent new book bottom billion and thank him for including kind references to my own work therein the very idea of the poverty trap as being critical in africa a concept at the core of the bottom billion has likewise been a core theme of my own writings on africa for my part i have worked hard to introduce in the academic literature and policy discussions the idea that poverty is involved in vicious circles related to violence natural resources landlockedness and other geographic factors and poor governance
2120835 he did some things in the first couple of years in particular that he should get some credit for particularly the continuing reduction in crime but i dont think he was an unusually good mayor
2120836 he was actually a capable guy and did a good job
2120837 but i think he had the tendency to see himself as the only person who was smart in the room
2120838 iranians refer to their new political radicals as neoconservatives with multiple layers of deliberate irony
2120839 the hotheads around president ahmadinejads office and the u s foreign policy radicals who cluster around vice president cheneys office listen to each other cite each others statements and god each other to new excesses on either side
2120840 the proposal on the table is to set up a commission which allows some details to be banged out after monday the opportunity to work out the issues of boundaries zones fees and money to spend on mass transit should allow sheldon silver and his constituents to agree to congestion pricing
2120841 you can mention in a kind of push poll way that hes done this this and this
2120842 but its another thing for him to have a few hundred million dollars of advertising saying that in emotional terms and really registering with people
2120843 fajarado is making a long term wager by carving out a foothold for the state in areas that were neglected for years
2120844 right now it is everything goes precisely because yes everything goes no good credit checking system no well placed fear of violating good norms one can get away with cheating
2120845 gadhafi has lost his position at the forefront of arab political activism to islamic fundamentalists
2120846 if the city were as racially divided as it was under mayor giuliani mr barrons combative stance against ms quinn might be more potent but ms quinn has a good reputation throughout the city and among african americans
2120847 of a palestinian elite that was hopelessly divided internally and many of whose prominent members had a variety of more or less entangling connections to the british overlords of the country while some had links to the zionists as well
2120848 the putin administration is trying to build up a sense of foreign threats to improve the popularity and ensure the continuation of his regime after the 2008 elections
2120849 most likely he just wants to remain in play hes a lame duck mayor and the renewed publicity over his shift to being an independent keeps him in the news increases his political currency and gives publicity to the city
2120850 oil can be a blessing or a bane for a country
2120851 the theory was to help sao tome avoid the resource curse
2120852 mayor bloomberg has done more for city issues to resonate as national issues than any other mayor since la guardia
2120853 citis focus on microfinance institutions that are approaching self sufficiency and the size of its grants make good sense
2120854 through the 1970s thanks in part to unions that negotiated wages collectively people with different abilities and capabilities were frequently paid the same amount for doing similar jobs
2120855 as a rule missouri state scholars are quicker to favor aggressive military policies than their counterparts at many other schools
2120856 this is an imaginative and inventive approach to a heartbreaking problem the destruction of what was once one of the middle easts strongest academic communities
2120857 if their dream is a world free of poverty they ought to know how to measure it
2120858 many highly qualified women take a detour from their career paths because of personal responsibilities

2120860 in 2004 those in the top 10th percentile earned 4 7 times more than those in the bottom 10th compared with four times as much in 1987
2120861 it may seem strange if five students with a camera can have such an impact on chinese policy
2120862 adoption is seen as a fraught issue for russians in general which is therefore going to be particularly sensitive to changes in u s russia relations
2120863 the illusion is that if you increase the supply and demand stays constant prices should fall
2120864 the problem is that as we increase the density we also increase the cost of providing services
2120865 learning to manage our natural resources and in particular our renewable resources
2120866 will be essential if were going to get through this very very difficult phase ahead
2120867 trends in labor force participation of married mothers of infants
2120868 malaria could be brought under control in africa by 2010 at a cost of about 3 billion a year
2120869 the disease will kill one million to three million children this year with 90 of the deaths in africa the tab could be picked up by the one billion people who live in wealthier countries at a cost of about 3 per person a year
2120870 first theres no question that the mayor of new york city is an international figure and this mayor has ambitions to be a national and world leader but thats a long way form saying he is going to run for president
2120871 i met boris yeltsin shortly after i arrived in moscow as the united states ambassador in april 1987 as we consider him in death two very different pictures are emerging in one he is the embodiment of the most important democratic revolution of the last half century and in the other he is a bumbling president who presided over russias turbulent still incomplete transition out of the soviet era but i think that to truly understand the man and the events he set in motion it helps to look back to that period just before he burst onto the global political scene
2120872 the key to solving the climate change crisis is technology to accommodate the economic aspirations of the more than five billion people in the developing countries the size of the world economy should increase by a factor of four to six by 2050 at the same time global emissions of greenhouse gases will have to remain steady or decline to prevent dangerous changes to the climate
2120873 a premature american departure from iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions
2120874 that by coming to new york to raise money mr obama appears to be mounting an aggressive campaign against ms clinton the city is considered the senators turf
2120875 the best secretaries general combine advocacy for the u n s core values with a very realistic and pragmatic sense of what can be accomplished at any point in time
2120876 a historical analogy helped mislead u s intelligence services about saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction in the run up to the current war in iraq
2120877 you dont know what the critical language is going to be 20 years from now and you need a reservoir
2120878 ramos horta is the perfect figurehead for the largely ceremonial post of president
2120879 the three powers iran the uk and the us are very aware that in the crowded waters of the gulf where control of subordinates is not complete you can get something you dont want as in 88
2120880 what has come to pass in gaza is embarrassing and shameful
2120881 knowing the facts will redouble the effort to assure it is not repeated
2120882 as the group of eight industrial nations would like china and india to be effective donors in africa the g8 would do well to lead by example the g8 can finally honor the 37 year old promise to provide 0 7 per cent of gross national product as aid the g8 can finally provide african countries with a yearly timetable for the promised but elusive doubling of aid by 2010
2120883 its almost like hes defing the war as a management issue
2120884 hes separating the policy issue from the management issue that makes sense because his main advantage as a political figure is his expertise as a manger
2120885 chinas inclusion in the wto and hence permanent normal trade relations with the u s is good for both sides because the trade disputes can be resolved through an impartial dispute settlement mechanism
2120886 tehran and the new iraqi government have never signed a treaty to replace the shah of irans agreement with saddam meaning the control of the waterway remains a matter of dispute
2120887 the problem is that nobody knows where the border is
2120888 the british might have thought they were on their side the iranians might have thought they were on their side
2120889 in my dozen years on faculty at columbia i have seen firsthand how essential it is to the citys future and that of our neighbors that we have a great urban university as a partner in meeting that challenge
2120890 i think its going to be the single most important environmental issue in the campaign
2120891 we know that market economy has different models and there is no one size fits all policies
2120892 the organizing principle of the new strategy is confrontation with and containment of shia influence and specifically iranian influence wherever it appears in the region
2120893 around one billion people live in extreme poverty suffering from economic deprivation so severe that they must struggle daily for survival a corollary is that institutional improvements take considerable time so the escape from extreme poverty is likely to take decades without denying the benefit of stronger institutions i suggest that excessive focus on institutional reforms has gotten the policy sequencing more wrong than right often more direct aid can dramatically reduce extreme poverty in just a few years
2120894 outside of the people in the intelligence community how many people do we have who read korean
2120895 how many people do we have who know much about korea very few
2120896 a ban on all public expression of religion by lhasa citizens would be unprecedented and its very strange that no reason had been given
2120897 they u n messed up in rwanda they have a history of ignoring major conflicts they never even had vietnam on the agenda if they dont get this one right it clearly shows that this old 1945 model of international security has gone the way of the dodo
2120898 each of the newly appointed commissioners brings a diverse set of experiences and expertise to the strong dynamic and high standards set by our current commissioners
2120899 when climate change skeptics mock the fear about the rise of a few degrees in temperature we should remind them of how it feels to have a 103 degree fever a few degrees above normal can mean the difference between life and death species survival and extinction and a few actions on our part could make the difference between a healthy planet and one that falls into an environmental tailspin
2120900 it may not be the cold war ii but russias image in america needs defrosting when putin appears on the cover of the economist looking like al capone holding a gas nozzle made to look like a submachine gun you know the kremlin p r people have got work to do
2120901 yin was behind some for the recent crackdowns in tibet hes particularly associated with certain specific crackdowns for example the demolition of the homes of 8 000 monks in sichuan four years ago
2120902 reverses everything that has happened in the middle east since 1901
2120903 all told about a quarter of our courses are taught by practitioners
2120904 the idea of cutting personal income tax rates has not received much attention because it is difficult to reduce the citys revenue base without identifying an alternative income source
2120905 unless you are willing to cut public services reducing income revenue streams is going to be problematic
2120906 this is a way to make top management accountable in ways that have never been tried before
2120907 iran would have been further away from dominating the region because it would have been deterred by iraq
2120908 by destroying what had formerly been the most powerful arab country we have thrust at iran an even greater power than it would have otherwise had
2120909 we started a particularly poisonous sectarian spiral downwards in the middle east
2120910 the idea of the caucus was to present ethnic unity back when people thought that was the only was they could be important
2120911 globalization has been a double edged sword to those able and willing to seize the opportunities and manage globalization on their own terms it has provided the basis of unprecedented growth china and india have for more than a quarter century been growing at historically unprecedented rates with hundreds of millions of people moving out of poverty they have taken advantage of globalization of knowledge and globalization of markets
2120912 in retrospect there was probably more of a problem with presentation than substance its a good sign that the more he explains the more the people are comfortable with it
2120913 favored creating a world environment organization but i dont believe its necessary for solving this problem instead the united nations and existing agreements such as the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse emissions could do the job if world leaders took them seriously enough the problem with international agreements is that people think they are made to be ignored
2120914 la guerra de irak ha sido un terreno de prueba no s lo para las nuevas armas y t cticas de las partes en liza ha acelerado y configurado tambi n el uso de nuevas tecnolog as que reducen dram ticamente la distancia entre productores y consumidores de informaci n en los conflictos en pol tica y en la vida de todos los d as
2120915 there was a danger of accidental war if anything goes wrong if something happens theres an unexplained explosion and we kidnap an iranian and the iranians respond to that somehow this could get out of control
2120916 in both situations we had overinvestment now in housing then in fiber optics
2120917 there is no indication in the region that there has been a big push for major structural reform since 1998
2120918 everything seems to be going in the right direction for latin america but much of the growth you see is due in large extent to much better external conditions if you take away some of those better external conditions such as favourable terms of trade the growth rate in the region is actually very poor
2120919 the u s will withdraw its troops from iraq at some point and when it does if not earlier the situation is likely to deteriorate badly this could be a truly dreadful time it could be a tsunami sweeping over the entire region
2120920 the government has really not provided a plan of action that is capable of ensuring this economic acceleration
2120921 well i think its part of a broader strategy which actually has been under way now for several months which involves basically the united states building a new coalition in the middle east between itself and israel and some of the conservative arab states the sunni arab states
2120922 even as he wins some initial praise ban is also raising some questions with his first appointments while leading others to wonder if he isnt coming off as too much of a big powers secretary general ban they worry is showing signs of paying deference to a time honored system that divvies up key posts among the powers that formed the un system six decades ago the us britain and france in particular so far theres been some of the same division of senior posts on the traditional great power spoils system that weve seen in the past says michael doyle a former senior un official now at columbia university in new york
2120923 the worst fallacy was probably the notion that the trade talks officially known as the doha development agenda will accelerate growth in poor countries
2120924 clearly the idea is maximum mayhem i think what they were trying to kill is people and the maximum number of people and thats just the tactic that theyve been using
2120925 americans are rummaging through the past for lessons to help us in iraq theres just one problem the two unsuccessful wars weve fought since world war ii dont teach the same lesson in korea and vietnam presidents had to salvage wars that had gone bad and their decisions provoked fierce congressional opposition but here the stories diverge in korea congress demanded that truman do more to win in vietnam it wanted to keep nixon from doing too much bush has clearly decided he wont be the wartime leader who responds to setbacks by doing too little
2120926 directing money to specific problems and expecting specific results has proven effective especially in improving peoples health
2120927 i am a strong believer that targeted investments to the needs of the poorest of the poor are the core strategy of meeting the millennium development goals in fighting poverty
2120928 late in 2006 several events moved the u s and other countries to serious global negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions it is therefore timely to ask what a meaningful global agreement would entail a solid starting point is the 1992 u n framework convention on climate change the international treaty that binds countries to act on the problem and under which specific measures such as the kyoto protocol are adopted the kyoto protocol adopted in 1997 took a short term view of a long term objective and as a result lost clarity credibility and support along the way the key now is to move beyond it
2120929 iraq is not vietnam yet history seems intent on harnessing them together even though iraqs story is far from complete each day raises the odds that the u s fate in iraq could eventually be the same as it was in vietnam defeat the differences are clear the policy consensus over vietnam ran deeper and lasted longer than on the iraq conflict while johnson and his advisers slogged deeper into vietnam with realistic pessimism bush and his colleagues plunged ahead in iraq with reckless optimism
2120930 if the increase in us force levels in iraq represents an escalation of the war as some insist then the extension of us power directly or indirectly against iran would represent an escalation of a different sort and no less momentous in terms of its potential long range implications
2120931 congressional leaders need to work to keep disagreement over what to do in iraq from spilling over into broader partisan gridlock the danger for everyone democratic and republican is that this division on the war leads to partisan conflict of the sort democrats wanted to diminish after the last election
2120932 its not just the companies its the global nature of his work and how much he has to travel to foreign countries when he needs to be in this country raising money
2120933 hes going to have to make a decision very very soon about running because its very hard to run a business or even be a full time public official and run for president
2120934 its a new year new york has a new governor and nationally the 110th congress convenes on thursday analysis of eliot spitzers first day on the job and a preview of the new session on capitol hill with freshman congresswoman kirsten gillibrand douglas muzzio professor of public affairs at baruch college and ester fuchs professor of international and public affairs and political science the school of international and public affairs sipa at columbia university and former advisor to mayor bloomberg preview governor spitzers first day on the job
2120935 once important figures in social groups adopt an idea others in the group are much more likely to to follow along then movements spread and grow along pre existing social networks
2120936 people join a movement because their friends and relatives are involved
2120937 if you hear that your friend is buying wind energy youre more likely to buy wind energy as well
2120938 while ford rejected the citys entreaties washington ultimately agreed to guarantee 1 65 billion in loans with help from state and municipal unions and new york eventually regained stability
2120939 was boris yeltsin the gravedigger of russian democracy the indictment against him looks strong if you give people reason to link democracy with economic privation political corruption and the trauma of national dismemberment lots of them will miss the stability of the old order some will miss joseph stalin and it isnt much of a response to say that this wasnt what you intended
2120940 libya was disappointed that the relationship had not grown closer quicker and had chosen not to take some steps washington wants there really was a sense that perhaps this had gone a little too far too fast from the libyan vantage point and they wanted to slow down to feel they are a little more in charge
2120941 everyone is always looking for the magic signal on how to get out before the carry trade unravels
2120942 having soundly defeated his conservative opponent in the second round of ecuadors presidential election left wing economist rafael correa is likely to prove more moderate than his rhetoric suggests yet in trying to govern a country notorious for its political instability the 43 year old novice politician must tread a thin line just to stay in office if the experience of past politicians is any indication correas chances dont appear favorable over the last decade ecuador has had eight different presidents the last two driven from office by mass protests yet while ecuador may renegotiate the terms of its debt and its contracts with oil companies a default is unlikely as is further seizing of private assets he knows the realities of global economics said joseph stiglitz a professor of finance and economics at columbia university and the former chief economist at the world bank
2120943 the united states is perceived as exacerbating and making the middle east crisis worse by our extreme one sided support of israel
2120944 in iraq and in the middle east generally these things are very much held against us
2120945 bolton was effective at the 15 member council but faltered trying to build consensus in the much larger general assembly particularly in favor of reforms he long advocated hes been a strong american ambassador to the security council but unfortunately the security council is just one piece of the puzzle up here
2120946 i dont think that having a conversation regionally with between the united states and iran and say syria is a magic border that somehow this is going to solve all our problems i do not think that it probably cant be solved without that because it is so far gone now that were talking about desperation measures
2120947 in 2006 maternal responsibilities and spousal frailties have a new ability to shoot high powered women down high level high impact jobs got redefined to become even more time consuming even more pressurizing these top jobs increasingly exclude women who have serious family responsibilities about two thirds of the highly qualified female labor pool fully 80 percent of women in extreme jobs have one foot out the door they do not want to work this hard under this pressure for more than 12 months the new extreme work model does not auger well for womens progress
2120948 a study entitled extreme jobs the dangerous allure of the 70 hour workweek to be published next week by the harvard business review allows us to
2120949 theres no definition of civil war thats chiseled in stone id call it an emerging civil war its more complicated than the image most people have of civil wars as a two way conflict between say one group of rebels and a government
2120950 the way we have proceeded with globalization has exacerbated the inequalities because it has been very asymmetric
2120951 capital moves more freely than labor and that means that the bargaining position of workers is disadvantaged relative to capital
2120952 there really is not a lot of discussion about north korea near the surface
2120953 i think there is a sense that there is not much they can do
2120954 if theyre going to be the next superpower they have to be pretty active on these kinds of things
2120955 amazingly wrong this happens to be a matter of life and death for millions of people so getting it wrong has huge consequences
2120956 it might be too late to stop iran form developing weapons grade nuclear fuel it could well be another decade or more before iran would actually have a deliverable nuclear weapon we are not in a crisis now and we shouldnt be acting as if we were
2120957 its very critical for abe to have good relations with the u s so this is a very important meeting for him with president george bush
2120958 the north korea issue is key and i would think abe is going to push a hard line
2120959 in some ways he seems to have been more an ambassador to the security council than to the united as a whole and i think he has done very well there
2120960 while oil shortages grab the headlines water scarcity is creating at least as many headaches around the world the most dramatic conditions are in asia where the worlds two megacountries china and india are grappling with deepening and unsolved water challenges
2120961 south africa will have their differences with the united states it is important to have states with a strong voice and real regional security role which south africa does indonesia which has the worlds largest muslim population will be an additional voice for islamic interests
2120962 its been shown very convincingly that there is no serious adverse affect on employment
2120963 we saw unemployment plummet after it was last raised in 1997
2120964 people are afraid that its a slippery slope that if they agree to sanctions today they give the authority for military intervention tomorrow
2120965 the political dispute over the use of force has eroded the councils credibility it is a sign of weakness and division
2120966 they are saying this is money that came from a bad source and im going to use it for good
2120967 no one has been working on building the basis for good local government
2120968 the way opponents have seized on the remarks by kerry is a sign that of just how contentious polarized and poisonous american politics has become
2120969 but now its all magnified by electronic media and the web whats lost in all of this is any genuine discussion of the issue
2120970 on the one hand its probably a moral imperative on the other hand i think its a political nonstarter
2120971 she clinton has to appeal to the blue state voters of new york at the same time that she has to appeal to the red state voters in the rest of the country
2120972 whenever shes doing anything in public thats an issue for her
2120973 brazilians are dividing mainly along class lines before their oct 29 runoff election which pits their first working class president against a patrician anesthesiologist who governed brazils wealthiest state this differentiation is a novel phenomenon in brazil
2120974 im a little concerned about how brazil survives this differentiation
2120975 its very possible that the u s has improved venezuelas chances and harmed guatemala by making this such a big deal

2121000 he realized he chass needed immediate care and needed to be in a secure professional environment not at home

2121025 among modern artists i conceptually identify with jackson pollock not that im a particular fan of his visual style but because he always identified himself as a painter even though a lot of the time his brush never hit the canvas theres something in that disconnect not using a brush or tool in traditional methods

2121055 the inference to be drawn from this chronology is that instead of directing its efforts to launching a generic patentee obtained and relied upon an admittedly weak patent for protection from other generic competition
2121056 the validity of the 183 patent has not be adjudicated by any court or the uspto on reexamination this court has no occasion to judge the merits of defendants invalidity arguments and declines to issue a finding that the patentee should have known of its patents invalidity absent such findings
2121057 in light of the challenging economic environment we aggressively pursued operational improvement in our restaurants helping us increase profits during the quarter
2121058 while our decision to reduce hours affected comparable store sales the store level margin improvement outweighed the impact of lower sales essentially we carefully analyzed our restaurants to optimize their store hours based on profitability after 3 p m on a prospective basis we have optimized store hours further and believe this will additionally reduce comparable store sales by approximately 0 6 percent our focus has been and will continue to be aimed at controlling the economics inside the four walls of the restaurant in addition we have reduced our general and administrative expenses where possible to ensure strong income from operations
2121059 we went through an extensive review of several online ordering vendors and selected onosys because of the systems user interface and ability to match our corporate brand
2121060 with several locations around schools we see online ordering being a huge asset to our franchisees bottom line and the integration with our pos will be a huge benefit
2121061 with web orders feeding seamlessly through onosys into the speedline pos systems at the restaurants pizza ranch will be well equipped to handle the added volume of online sales
2121062 it is exciting to help a long time customer like pizza ranch extend the capabilities of their pos with new tools from one of our technology partners

2121066 ive had a good break and am ready to get back in the saddle
2121067 we finished the first half of the season with good rewards from our efforts and im sure we can continue that momentum at brno
2121068 i got a good result here last year and the gsv r was no the podium with john hopkins on board so it all looks good for a strong performance i am fully focused on keeping my podium run going
2121069 hvad er det med nyt r vi fejrer at alt det nye skal begynde p akkurat samme m de hvert r kogt torsk smager af helvede til og folkene bag 90 rs f dselsdagen er for l ngst d de og det var ikke engang sjovt da de levede hvor trist skal det v re
2121070 vi m godt have porno i b rneh jde i kiosken og i fjernsynet men jeg m ikke tage mit t j af hvis jeg vil have lidt sol p min n gne krop i frederiksberg have selvf lgelig skal man ikke l be efter en b rnehave i en cottoncoat med en k mpedaggert og r be jeg knalder jer alle sammen men det er jo ikke det samme som i al fredsommelighed at tisse op af et tr
2121071 jeg er meget inspireret af buddhismen det er sjovt at bruge i comedy fordi man slipper sin offerrolle og accepterer at tingene er som de er alt andet er et sp rgsm l om indstilling s slipper man for at det er et personligt komplot hver gang det regner
2121072 der er en stor m ngde humor i at se tingene for det de er det er morsomt at folk selv tror p de ting de siger
2121073 jamen man skal da stemme nej det er ikke noget man skal det er noget man kan og der er heller ikke noget med at jeg stemmer blankt jeg stemmer bare ikke jeg l ber jo heller ikke op til kassen p mc donalds og siger at jeg ikke skal bestille en hamburger vel
2121074 n r man griner s springer man ud af en tankestr m og er til stede i nuet folk fors ger at skabe sammenh ng i de informationer jeg giver dem men i det jeblik de fatter pointen s slipper de ligningen og s ha ha det er en lille dosis af at v re i nuet
2121075 det havde jeg faktisk ikke t nkt over jeg tror p at man gennem livet m der udfordringer og hvis man ikke f r bearbejdet dem s bliver man pr senteret for de samme begivenheder i morgen
2121076 pointen med mit show denne gang er at man aldrig kan vende tilbage til at v re det menneske man var engang jeg kan jo ikke v re en 23 rig aggressiv komiker igen der bare griber mikrofonen og smider de underliggende lag selvom der ville v re en k mpe tryghed i det jeg synes jo ikke l ngere at det er sjovt at snakke om tandl gebes g
2121077 det er akkurat som den gr ske filosof heraklit der ikke kan bade i den samme flod to gange alt er i konstant forandring
2121078 jeg fik en ungdomsdepression af en art hvor alting blev gr t hvis noget gik d rligt s var det nogen der havde gjort det mod mig s lavede jeg opr r og malede p det hele og lavede fuck det hele h rgerkomik det kommer der bare ikke noget smukt ud af
2121079 p det tidspunkt havde jeg ingen erkendelse af at det hele er mit ansvar der er ikke nogen der kan skubbe n ind i en offerrolle det v lger man selv
2121080 i buddhismen s jeg at der ikke er noget der er ondt eller godt der er kun m den du anskuer livet p sindets indstilling jeg l ste alt hvad der kunne opdrives om buddhismen og gik til m der hos buddhistiske lamaer
2121081 jeg fors ger at komme i t med nuet men jeg er slet ikke afslappet nok i perioder bruger jeg kinesisk gymnastik qi gong eller japansk shakuhachi fl jte som meditation men tit ender jeg med dvd film og sm ger og t nker at i morgen skal jeg leve i nuet gennem rene har jeg f et min egen hylde jeg reflekterer over nogle ting men jeg har droppet at n at blive et oplyst menneske p t liv
2121082 du har friheden til at tegne hvad du vil men hvis der bagefter kommer en og klasker dig i hovedet med en sten s er du selv ude om det
2121083 det er da pissefr kt at tegne i en avis men de har jo ikke tegnet b rneporno s kunne vi se hvad der skete de har jo ytringsfrihed s de kunne tegne lige hvad de ville men det g r de ikke det ville nemlig v re uh rt hvis de skulle tegne et realistisk billede af chefredakt rens s n der bliver voldtaget af en abe d r g r gr nsen men det er det vi er ved at uds tte nogle andre mennesker for der allerede har sat en gr nse vi kan g re det ja men hvorfor hvis alt bliver en regel om at vi m g til gr nsen skal vi s g re det
2121084 hmm vi kunne starte med at afskaffe de regler der ikke giver mening man kunne sige at hvis du aldrig er blevet straffet for vold s m tte du g med en stor gun men hvis du kom i slagsm l s blev alle dine rettigheder taget fra dig pludselig skulle slagsbr dre v re meget forsigtige nej den er ikke helt f rdig
2121085 nej jeg er bare ikke s sikker p at demokrati er den perfekte l sning n r s mange mennesker ikke f r deres behov opfyldt mindretallet g lder jo ikke lige nu bestemmer usa fordi de er flere selvom det er benlyst at de er dumme som rungende huller i jorden
2121086 vi bliver ved med at lave regler og pudse p dem vi har fordi det i virkeligheden ikke helt virker skulle vi pr ve om parkeringsautomaten kan tage dankort eller lade det koste penge at k re i bil om s ndagen s vi formindsker co2 udslip nej hvad med at g re alle biler i verden ulovlige det kan virke som en lidt frisk beslutning men vi er n dt til at g re noget drastisk hvis vi vil v re her ellers er det for sent om et jeblik
2121087 hvorfor skulle jeg ikke direkte sige det jeg mener nogle af ungerne tror at jeg er en slagsbror fordi jeg laver r stand up og jeg bliver tit tilbudt stoffer men jeg ved godt hvordan man opf rer sig ordentligt og det f ler jeg mig forpligtet til at sige
2121088 s l nge det er gode ting jeg siger s kan jeg ikke se at det skulle v re et problem jeg beder folk om at opf re sig ordentligt det er ikke fedt at sl andre mennesker ned og det kan ikke diskuteres
2121089 hvis man er psykopat og ikke ejer medf lelse s kan man stadig ikke sl en anden mand ned han er en aktie og aktier kyler man ikke i pejsen han betaler ni millioner i skat s det er ham der betaler dine guldbajere og dine skrabelodder uanset hvordan du anskuer det s er det d rligt for business at sl en mand ned
2121090 ja jeg fejler selv hele tiden mit temperament k rer ikke s let op l ngere men det sker at jeg klasker en myg der sidder p min hals eller bagtaler en eller anden hvis jeg er stresset det er nederen for jeg g r det jo kun for at fremh ve mig selv
2121091 det startede som en ren gak gak komedie men endte med at blive en buddhistisk historie det er en karmisk komedie der stiller skarpt p de rigtige ting i livet i stedet for altid at se p hvor d rligt man har det
2121092 i buddhismen s jeg at der ikke er noget der er ondt eller godt der er kun m den du anskuer livet p sindets indstilling

2121094 i never got to race in 2006 bceause my co driver started the race and lasted about three corners hopefully this time will be better
2121095 it still has to be fully decided but i am happy to do that if the teams would like me to
2121096 we need the first stage done first which is about how we can all work together without making it too heavy we need to have something that is clear but we dont want a 100 page document it would be a shame if it resorted to that
2121097 we appreciate this approach to ask the teams or in this case to the engine manufacturers to come up with a proposal of next generation engines
2121098 we have only started to discuss it but we want to do it
2121099 what the outcome is in terms of technology timing and costs it is too early to say we can just say that we share the desire to bring costs down we want to have an engine that carries future road car technology so the aims are quite similar but if the approach is the same it is too early to say
2121100 we are definitely not in the sport to finance several other teams
2121101 im happy to be here i really am it has been a crazy two days
2121102 and i hope that i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days so time will tell and i dont want to say be patient do you have a great news tip story idea or would you like to submit your cover e mail us

2121212 as everyone who has been to a meeting knows they are very paper intensive events
2121213 each piece of paper used in a meeting has the equivalent carbon emissions of burning a 60w light bulb for 1 hour as such a meeting of 10 people will typically have emissions of around 1 6kg of co2 equivalent to driving a typical 4x4 for 6 miles
2121214 the meetingpod is a paperless electronic meeting system which is much more energy efficient than using paper and uses a fraction of the energy used by laptops it holds all the meeting information that each attendee can view on their separate meetingpod this means that they do not have to print agendas minutes from the last meeting or any other information relevant to that meeting even separate presentations can be viewed on the built in screen making meeting room tables more efficient and easier to layout and use
2121215 venues are starting to look at their corporate social responsibility policies very closely

2121238 in a soft market the temptation is often to discount heavily and not look closely at what you are getting out of your rooms
2121239 at trump we carefully consider our pricing and products together
2121240 historically cash guests were not regarded as very important to the atlantic city gaming industry
2121241 cash guests are increasingly attractive because they appreciate everything our properties offer they enjoy the shows shopping and our restaurants and clubs growing this segment is one strategy helping us in the softer market this also dovetails with atlantic citys program to market itself as a destination offering more than gaming
2121242 we manage our availability and set rates based on total guest value not just room rate so the right guests always have a room at our properties
2121243 adding these rooms in a soft market has created an opportunity for us to fill the void
2121244 to drive more business we aggressively stepped up marketing efforts and were successful with tv and print media promotions geared toward non gaming customers
2121245 the rainmaker software helps us forecast our cash customer demand independently from our casino business so we can say on any given day what our booking pace is and what our demand appears to be for our cash customers
2121246 we were compiling a considerable amount of data manually to make determinations about forecasted customer demand by customer worth
2121247 our old method of data gathering and forecasting was outdated now we are receiving that information automatically and are able to identify current customer trends more quickly these trends are subsequently compared to year over year performance by calendar date the resulting data enables us to perform accurate forecast modeling to effectively set rates and availability by customer value thus laying the groundwork for revenue optimization of the resort

2121252 the chinese hotel industry has thus far faced a year of significant challenges ranging from natural disaster to an uncertain global economy
2121253 however with the twenty ninth olympiad in beijing only days away the chinese hotel industry will be looking to the event to provide the profits in 2008
2121254 many of the new hotels in northern china were developed specifically to meet the needs of the olympics
2121255 it will be interesting to see if chinese markets can adapt to the new supply levels when the games move on
2121256 this is the first major design change for the candlewood suites brand in 12 years and were extremely pleased with the outcome of the new look
2121257 before making any changes we did extensive research which showed that guests and owners preferred a more residential design in extended stay properties and were certain that this new prototype will meet the needs of both audiences were able to provide our guests with even more of the comforts they find at home at a cost thats still attractive to our owners
2121258 as big consumers of energy and water hotels are being hit hard by the rising cost of such resources
2121259 at the same time they have to maintain incredibly high levels of cleanliness and hygiene and keep their customers happy this is no mean feat our new ag shower head is designed to help such organisations juggle these pressures and get results in three ways save money increase hygiene and maintain customer satisfaction
2121260 as technology and economic development around the world take the tourism market to a truly global level its the responsibility of companies like pegasus to support the world tourism investment summit in bringing together the best and most current investment management and technology solutions to developing markets

2121262 all delegates will work to explore new investment opportunities broaden networks and foster collaboration on new and innovative projects in the tourism industry
2121263 we discovered a market niche in many asian cities where existing buildings in key locations were not being torn down due to the lengthy process required to obtain new construction permits the hotel uno brand is ideal to fill this niche
2121264 effective revenue management is an essential tool process and discipline for nearly all asset managers who serve customer demand that varies by market segment season and economic cycle

2121266 once we started using ideas v5i we realized we could achieve higher rates when we didnt think we could before and soon started noticing a significant return
2121267 ideas is extremely successful in the hospitality industry and its highly regarded application base is capable of much more
2121268 sas will build on that for other industries while remaining attentive to the extremely loyal ideas customer base sas has the will the resources and the domain expertise to nurture the potential of ideas
2121269 sas is a perfect fit for ideas customers of neither company are locked into long term licenses so we both have to earn our customers business on a daily basis
2121270 we have sought for some time to expand our scope beyond hospitality applications and sas with a corporate culture remarkably similar to ours will provide ideas with the resources to stretch its wings

2121328 nonaspirin nsaids cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and the risk for stroke
2121329 this study suggests that rofecoxib and valdecoxib were associated with higher stoke risk than other nsaids
2121330 because of this and other studies their withdrawal from the market is appropriate and these medications should not be re introduced especially since safer alternatives are available
2121331 since all nsaids including coxibs can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding we believe that caution is warranted especially with long term use of these medicines

2121351 a brutal dictator with ties to terrorism will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states
2121352 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him
2121353 i heard your book on tape and im now convinced that george bush deceived congress
2121354 ive already bought several copies of your book and ive passed them out to colleagues and i told them read the book
2121355 there may be as many as one million victims not one victim but one million victims in their cold graves right now decomposing as a result of george bushs monumental crime
2121356 what person in authority on the face of this globe is representing these one million people in their graves fighting to bring about justice for them pursuing the person the guilty person who put them there
2121357 no you didnt hear what i said i said what person in authority is going after the killer of these million people
2121358 i dont have the authority of an emaciated moth i dont have any authority
2121359 i agree that he should bush should be prosecuted for murder and i hope he is prosecuted for murder
2121360 mr bugliosi come november im going to be out in the public with you and i want to be at your side when george bush hopefully is indicted for first degree murder
2121361 i support you and i want bush to be prosecuted for first degree murder

2121363 well yeah a lot of people are angry but they dont have the courage to do anything about it
2121364 i understand the whole thing about the drama between me and my mother to be honest with you we had a very one sided relationship and for obvious reasons she had to make the majority of the sacrifices otherwise we didnt go forward im pretty sure that my mother would want to forever manage me shell always be my partner

2121370 thats whats really important thats all that really matters right there people
2121371 what im asking for is for the leadership to reach out to the elected officials were making it aware that we want to work with them but because the hmong culture is so close knit i dont want this to be a pie in the sky thing we need to really sit down and talk about their young people being recruited to gangs and really coming up with some comprehensive solutions
2121372 less than a football field away there were about six boys playing plus the neighbor you know hes watching tv minding his own business and a bullet whizzes over his head hits his kitchen wall and then lands by his feet we dont deserve this this is a pretty quiet safe neighborhood i mean we get along theres always kids plays i dont understand if you have a problem with someone why do you have to pick up a gun i mean cant we come up with some resolution where we can talk to each other and whatever the problem is resolve it with words instead of bullets
2121373 i had other kids here doing something constructive so it was kind of do i show up and show face and listen to someone talk about how bad the asian gangs are or do i come here and do something constructive with the kid who do want to make a difference in the community and i just chose to come here
2121374 they dont have the time or the means to acclimate because their priority is to feed their children and to house their families
2121375 the kids who get involved find it very difficult to get out because number one just the nature of a gang but also because there is that family aspect where most of these kids are brought in by their cousins or their brothers not necessarily people they meet randomly on the street
2121376 were allowing our kids to go hang out with that cousin who is bad for them but because theyre family we tend not to say anything
2121377 i mean you can look at it from a racial standpoint and say yeah its the hmong kids and theres all these racial barriers and stuff and yeah were working to get passed all that but this particular issue i feel is a law enforcement issue i mean you get the kids who are doing the shooting you lock em up end of story

2121381 in the short term the closure should be deferred because penrhiwllan post office currently doesnt have a postmaster
2121382 by going on this march i am hoping to raise island wide support for the campaign to keep our post offices open
2121383 in many of the communities that i will be visiting the post office is also part of the only village shop
2121384 if the post office closes then the shop will inevitably follow and the heart of the community will disappear
2121385 we want to see post offices thrive so that they can continue to provide an essential service in the communities they serve
2121386 to help achieve this we need to help individual sub postmasters and sub postmistresses have sustainable and viable businesses in the future
2121387 one of the main aims of gathering the jewels is to make the history of wales more accessible and we hope that this website will do that

2121395 i had hoped that president bush would bat 300 which means failure seven out of 10 times in washingtons tough league his average has probably been less than that misjudgments missed opportunities and acceptance of faulty intelligence reports in a world of deception are understandable but hazardous to a nations health even so thats not the same as soiling the oval office with lies and worse

2121397 john f kennedys success in keeping unreported his record setting flow of young women into senate bedchambers and then the white house probably led him to think he could get away with other quasi secret activities such as the bay of pigs and numerous castro assassination plots on the other hand his james bond style emotional detachment allowed him to be a cool cold war poker player he went to the brink of nuclear war without being moved by a normal mans sensitivities and god was merciful in keeping us from disaster

2121402 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2121403 were already familiar with multiple aliases if theres one thing were certain about this suspect its that his true name is not clark rockefeller
2121404 i can only say that the investigation remains very active and is growing more focused by the day
2121405 he said he was from bavaria we were a modest middle class family and he would say things like i would never live like this he knew where the line was and he flirted with it
2121406 we did not really end up on a happy note he had some fantastic stories about his parents it turned out he was from a poor working class background

2121411 its no secret that they airports in the middle east india and china are taking our staff
2121412 airports all over are building up there is an overdose of airports in the middle east for example and big airports have a requirement for talent and staff
2121413 changi is one of the highest profile and well regarded airport operators in the world so its staff are naturally an attractive proposition for airports in the middle east and elsewhere that are expanding

2121420 it provides long term commitment of resources necessary to help find solutions to many of the issues that lake michigan is facing today those issues are vast as we all know invasive species polluted runoff mercury pollution habitat destruction so theres many things that are impacting lake michigan that were concerned about
2121421 theres other elements of this settlement for example the early retirement of two coal fired power plants in presque isle theres construction of new 50 megawatts of 100 percent biomass construction of 15 new megawatts of solar power by 2015
2121422 any good agreement has that and thats the case here and it certainly helps from a customer standpoint too knowing that this project will be able to go forward and be able to operate and therefore be able to use that energy that will be produced here as opposed to if there was any challenges that may have prevented us from moving forward with operating the plant we would have needed to replace that energy with perhaps more expensive purchased power
2121423 pretty expensive cooling towers at perhaps as much as 300 million dollars

2121445 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2121446 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2121447 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself

2121455 with no end in sight to the credit crunch and high energy costs the short to medium future looks grim
2121456 the stark reality is that in a core capital intensive industry like ours where you have a rapidly declining customer base and sales together with rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs then jobs go and companies go out of business
2121457 in the past nine months the industry has experienced a drop in business of over 30 together with an increase in production energy costs of 86 with transport costs increasing by 46
2121458 we are well pleased given the disadvantage that general area has suffered over the decades

2121469 recent articles suggesting that ron is considering stepping back or that he will step back if the world championship is won by vodafone mclaren mercedes this year have been based around a very old quote
2121470 ron has made it clear on numerous occasions that he has made no decision as to if and when he may or may not step aside

2121502 they can either continue with business as usual which costs an estimated 1 000 deaths each day due to gun violence or in the alternative reach legally binding agreements to restrain the illicit trade
2121503 not only do these weapons prolong violent conflicts but their uncontrolled spread also poses a grave danger to long term stability and development both domestically and within the region as a whole
2121504 that can only be tackled if all countries work together with common guidelines across the world

2121519 when we started boxing at 12 years old it was more like a hobby
2121520 but after the first six fights we started realizing that we missed the ring in between fights we would rest one or two weeks and then say we miss the gym and then we realized we wanted to dedicate ourselves to this
2121521 we both did it at the same time and not only that we classified at the same event
2121522 my favorite boxer is my brother but when i step into the ring i try not to emulate his style

2121534 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

2121551 when youre laid off there is a feeling of disenchantment from working for big corporations its like youre woken up and you look around and re evaluate the benefits of a corporate job and re examine your own value and if youre being utilized to the fullest
2121552 but even bigger than that there is some feeling of betrayal that gives you a push and makes you say i dont need them i can start my own company ill show them they made a mistake letting me go
2121553 there are entrepreneurs who swear by downturns by the way talent is cheaper office space is cheaper and more plentiful and theres a sense of urgency that drives people to make it work

2121555 it was definitely a little stressful for the first several months and for my wife too i am sure
2121556 getting laid off gave us a great excuse to get over the initial momentum hurdle we had a hard time trying to do only working nights weekends

2121564 i dont believe that walking out was an option i know if i was a supporter i wouldnt be very impressed
2121565 those powers can only be transferred when there is the required community confidence
2121566 it is critical that any arrangements have the widest and broadest support possible
2121567 i believe that the involvement of the assemblys executive and review committee in the autumn will help ensure this is the case
2121568 too often in the past short term cobbled together political deals have been done which have not been in the best interests of northern ireland

2121588 training has been really good were looking sharp and we cant wait to kick the season off against norwich on saturday
2121589 one strict interpretation would be that nike is even more irresponsible for fomenting and supporting homophobia in the black community where aids rates are higher and homophobia is therefore more deadly
2121590 the opposite but equally strict interpretation would be that basketball is a sport with lots of black players at its highest levels and therefore using black slang etc in ads targeted specifically at basketball players is only natural and right
2121591 so nike should pull the ads or rework them to be friendlier to gay basketball fans at least be aspirational you bastards the sad part is that this isnt a new low in homophobic advertising its the sports status quo
2121592 cultural disconnect and maybe just a little bit of an overreaction
2121593 this particular ad in the hyperdunk series doesnt bother me because i feel like i understand that that aint right is not referring to a gay lifestyle but rather the fact that a guy just got embarrassed because he was dunked on
2121594 i believe many of the people who want to see homophobia will see it for various reasons whether its a dislike for nike or the fact that they face real homophobia on a day to day basis therefore they are more sensitive to the subject
2121595 nike is strongly opposed to discrimination of any kind and has a long history of supporting athletes regardless of their sexual orientation the advertisement in question is based upon a common insight from within the game of basketball the athletic feat of dunking on the opposition the individual print ad represents only one aspect of a broader campaign and based upon a true sports moment
2121596 there have been six straight moves of weaker employment this year
2121597 the ongoing problems in the housing market are compounded by a generally weaker economy foreclosures wont go down until we start to see employment move up again

2121600 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story

2121650 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
2121651 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
2121652 they did not challenge it very much and it therefore turned out to be quite a simple fraud to conduct

2121708 the liberal theologians of the last century were working on the wrong lines they threw away not only the mythology but also the kerygma itself were they right is that the treatment the new testament itself required that is the question we must face today the last twenty years have witnessed a movement away from criticism and a return to a na ve acceptance of the kerygma the danger both for theological scholarship and for the church is that this uncritical resuscitation of the new testament mythology may make the gospel message unintelligible to the modern world we cannot dismiss the critical labors of earlier generations without further ado we must take them up and put them to constructive use failure to do so will mean that the old battles between orthodoxy and liberalism will have to be fought out all over again that is assuming that there will be any church or any theologians to fight them at al perhaps we may put it schematically like this whereas the older liberals used criticism to eliminate the mythology of the new testament our task to day is to use criticism to interpret it of course it may still be necessary to eliminate mythology here and there but the criterion adopted must be taken not from modern thought but from the understanding of human existence which the new testament itself enshrines
2121709 the church has historically held to the inerrancy of the bible while there has not been a fully enunciated theory until modern times nonetheless there was down through the years of church history a general belief in the complete dependability of the bible

2121844 la poblaci n que se encuentra en el rango de edad de 45 a 59 a os que vive en los principales centros urbanos del pa s tiene una mayor probabilidad de estar desocupada en comparaci n con otros grupos etarios y en particular si se trata de mujeres a su vez los datos evidencian que corren m s riesgo de padecer situaciones de empleo precario o de subempleo aquellos mayores que no han finalizado los estudios secundarios
2121845 trabaj durante quince a os para filiales argentinas de empresas internacionales situaci n que hizo que tuviera mi vida planificada sin embargo al profundizarse la crisis de los 90 la empresa en la que trabajaba sufri un cambio del paquete accionario y los nuevos directivos resolvieron varios ajustes de personal de esta manera me encontr fuera del mbito empresario con 50 a os de edad y en medio de una crisis nacional tan aguda que hac a in til cualquier intento de recolocaci n laboral
2121846 publiqu mi curr culum en todos los sitios de internet que pude contest avisos de diarios y hasta me present espont neamente en empresas y consultoras cada vez m s los avisos de trabajo aparec an con la cl usula hasta 35 a os y aunque siempre mencion mi personalidad din mica el hecho de estar actualizado y de contar con la habilidad profesional solicitada los resultados fueron nulos
2121847 la gente joven tiene muchas cosas positivas como empuje fuerza entusiasmo y b squeda de proyecci n pero los m s grandes poseen otros valores y equilibran con otras cualidades en primer lugar aportan idoneidad en una profesi n o actividad lo cual es fundamental para formar y capacitar a los m s j venes y adem s suman sensatez reflexi n y madurez
2121848 no buscan un desarrollo futuro sino la tranquilidad de una estabilidad laboral y de sentir que siguen siendo productivos hoy una persona de 45 a os probablemente tenga por delante unos 30 o 40 a os de vida y no puede ni deber a renunciar a tener un trabajo digno
2121849 desde el punto de vista del mercado argentino las empresas prefieren gente de menor edad s lo en algunas posiciones gerenciales ya que en otras funciones la edad es un beneficio m s que una carga y el l mite de empleabilidad se extiende incluso hasta los 55 a os
2121850 incluyen una recalificaci n y mejoramiento profesional capacitaci n enfocada a las necesidades del mercado y reentrenamiento laboral
2121851 no es lo mismo un profesional con trayectoria que uno sin ella admite y en algunos casos tener 45 a os puede significar ser muy joven es cierto que si una persona no tiene una especialidad definida y desea encarar una nueva carrera a esta edad puede ser m s dif cil si una se ora por ejemplo dej de trabajar a los 25 a os porque fue mam y luego desea reingresar al mercado laboral a los 40 el problema no es que ella tenga 40 sino que dej de trabajar hace mucho tiempo
2121852 sin embargo las compa as no le preguntan al empleado que van a excluir si aceptar a continuar con un sueldo menor o con una reducci n de la jornada laboral
2121853 la situaci n para los mayores de 45 a os ha mejorado bastante en los ltimos tiempos son m s buscados y necesitados luego de la crisis de 2001 cuando las empresas redujeron al m ximo sus dotaciones paulatinamente se fue comprobando el incremento de la demanda de profesionales que acompa al crecimiento econ mico
2121854 hay que tener en cuenta los requisitos excluyentes es decir aquellos que s o s debe tener la persona para postularse si uno no los cumple es mejor seguir leyendo hasta encontrar alguno que responda a las propias capacidades conocimientos y competencias
2121855 por lo tanto hay que tener claro que un curr culum es como una foto debe mostrar qui n es el postulante y al mismo tiempo brindar su mejor perfil contar la historia de vida completa con mayor foco en los ltimos a os y en la experiencia laboral m s destacada siempre en relaci n con la posici n que se desea alcanzar en este momento
2121856 todo sirve en el momento de buscar empleo las redes sociales la red de contactos propia los amigos hoy decir que uno est buscando trabajo no perjudica porque nadie est exento de sufrir un traspi laboral hay que pedir entrevistas y no frustrarse por no lograrlas ya que muchas veces es dif cil que nos atiendan
2121857 me despidieron del laboratorio en el que trabajaba y tomaron a gente m s joven por lo tanto m s econ mica para la empresa al menos sa fue la excusa que me dieron

2121987 the biggest hurdle that ive encountered in trying to share this information is a sort of knee jerk reaction that men arent interested in these kinds of contraceptives and that women wont trust them to take them

2122000 i think the best part of the ceremony itself was when the guy was flying around and lighting the torch

2122002 it was amazing to walk out and see the crowd the lighting of the torch was phenomenal it was all very loud and powerful

2122065 an architect house plan is fed digitally into the frame master machines cad program to create an optimised frame design
2122066 from this the frame master then manufactures cut to length galvanised steel sections the sections are assembled to form a complete house frame including door and window frames plus the roof trusses
2122067 the time required to complete a house is reduced by a third compared with traditional construction
2122068 the components of the frame can be partially or fully assembled in the factory and delivered directly to site leading to a quicker assembly on site once a section of the frame is in place the builder can then move directly to exterior and interior cladding
2122069 this new solution to house construction and extension meets the growing need for a faster more efficient building process that is cost effective and versatile while providing a high quality aesthetically pleasing end result
2122070 because of the technical requirements needed to build the structure i think it will ensure a better quality building and it will create more skilled construction jobs
2122071 in terms of sustainability this construction will render a good thermal performance for the walls are well insulated the construction method can also render a lower embodied energy as less material is utilised at a lower energy input

2122075 this ensures better architecture and by giving them exposure to technical training and latest product innovations ensures better build environments and better buildings
2122076 our accreditation is important as it ensures that we are able to work collaboratively with architects to provide systems and products for their latest designs
2122077 todwil is one of the few companies in the country that designs manufactures and installs marketing solutions in this way we reduce costs manage campaigns more effectively and minimise room for error with the retail economy in the state that its currently in it is more important than ever for brands to communicate with potential consumers at the point of sale effectively and persuasively the acquisition of cape tech plastics enhances our ability to do this and allows us to grow our extensive service offering and diversify our client base it made economic sense to coincide it with the move to our new factory

2122088 i havent really come across sms jargon as a problem it is being used everywhere and it has become a part of communication it is surely spoiling communication but it becomes impossible to mentally switch between the writing styles i would not use that kind of style when writing to a client but i do use it for internal mails and mails to friends it has just become more convenient a form to get rid of
2122089 i hate it the sms jargon can get too confusing to use i usually land up sending three part messages to people but not i prefer it that way
2122090 i too dont like to use the sms style i think it spoils the beauty of english language i also try and not use it because i am afraid ill land up using it everywhere i have seen many of my friends who have landed up using it in their exams and professors can get really annoyed with it
2122091 i like to use it because it is very convenient and it saves time it also saves money as i can say more in one message
2122092 i use it with colleagues and me boss also because we know each other well but i wouldnt use sms jargon with him otherwise for me at times it is person specific if someone doesnt like it i try and not use short forms when messaging such people i dont use short forms when messaging my mom otherwise it is convenient

2122099 they spoke to her and told her that they were willing to help her with an attorney or whatever she might need help with theyre hoping that they can do something with the other children
2122100 they feel that shes just had too many stressful things going on in her life and perhaps thats whats caused her to do this

2122105 women are more settled and happy than men in their 20s and 30s because they are trained to find a man and be beautiful
2122106 men are pressured to make a career and provide for a family so its a stressful time later in their 40s and 50s as a womans physical beauty begins to fade and the children grow up she can become depressed because her reason for living is starting to disappear
2122107 older men are more likely to suck it up go get a porsche or a 21 year old

2122110 a lot of green deodorants lack the active ingredients common to conventional deodorants aluminum zirconium or zinc
2122111 the worst ones are known as parabens which are preservatives added to a lot of personal care products theyve been found to mimic estrogen in laboratory tests and cause proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro i think its more important to avoid those and ive found if you just look at the labels there are many standard deodorants that dont have parabens
2122112 you can make your own deodorant antiperspirant just with baking soda and cornstarch baking soda to deodorize as we all know from our refrigerators and corn starch because it absorbs moisture you could shake it into your hand and put it on in the gym or at home you can use a luxurious powder puff

2122114 the alcohol in towelettes makes sweat evaporate and its gentle enough to put on your face or other places as the need may be plus alcohol is a really good antiseptic its antibacterial and doesnt have the environmental consequenes of triclosan which is a chemical used in a lot of products

2122120 creating the capacity to issue debentures had been in fact a central reason for metros formation
2122121 but what will astonish anyone who has lived through the public debt fearing 1990s is how proud metro was at having borrowed this capital
2122122 a municipality should be ashamed of itself for not borrowing to build for the future
2122123 this is good debt and it is future taxpayers who should be paying for things that are built now

2122132 the sex workers are very visible and there are a lot of sessions around their issues no doubt than ever before in the past
2122133 what did they do they fought for their health by advocating for sex work to be recognised as legitimate work and by defending sex workers human rights
2122134 in many parts of the world sex workers do not even have access to basics such as sufficient male and female condoms

2122140 we cant find work so we do this not only are we lowly paid but we face extreme harassment from the police our clients and even at times from our masters when we are raped and we report it the police ask us how we can be raped when we are men

2122147 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2122148 we are bringing these challenges now because this coal plant as permitted would fail to meet core clean air act requirements
2122149 at nearly 2 billion and without any means to capture its carbon dioxide pollution this plant represents a remarkably bad deal for virginia
2122150 the southern environmental law center and its co petitioners fail to recognize that state officials based their decisions to permit the plant on sound science
2122151 the rhetoric used to incite unwarranted fear among local residents concerning health issues and phantom environmental impacts are not supported by facts additionally these lawsuits do nothing to advance realistic solutions to meeting the growing electricity demands in virginia
2122152 our state needs clean affordable and reliable electricity and the community needs the stable high paying jobs that will improve the quality of life in wise county
2122153 the plant also will double the communitys economic output and that means tax revenue and better services for area citizens
2122154 this is the most thoroughly considered and strictest air permit in the history of the commonwealth and we are confident it will be upheld in the courts
2122155 each new power plant using advanced clean coal technologies moves forward the reality of near zero emissions from coal fueled power plants
2122156 what dust we raise said the fly upon the chariot wheel
2122157 1 the act clean air act does not authorize it to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change and 2 even if it had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards it would have been unwise to do so because a causal link between greenhouse gases and the increase in global surface air temperatures was not un equivocally established

2122186 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

2122188 maybe youre a gruff looking guy but a softy on the inside as evidenced by your fluffy poodle or pampered yorkshire and youre perfectly comfortable with your dogs demeanor and secure about your preference
2122189 perhaps your refined elegance and business pedigree doesnt quite match up with your scruffy looking terrier or rowdy jack russell so you cant always judge a book by its cover but the type of dog certainly may reveal who the person is within or what they aspire to be
2122190 while many women will contend that they simply enjoy putting a cute coat on their dog many men will view that woman as high maintenance

2122259 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2122260 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2122261 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2122262 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2122263 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2122264 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2122265 what scavengers are doing is negligible in the grand scheme of our garbage program
2122266 she probably taped something like a silicone insert inside her bra

2122270 i put one up in every room even in the bathrooms
2122271 our canadian forces have been in the unfortunate position of not having any other option than hitchhiking rides with allies in moving personnel in countries like afghanistan
2122272 these days are over as are the days of delays in purchases or enduring contract cancellations for political purposes
2122273 overseas the helicopters will reduce our reliance on allies and protect our troops on dangerous missions
2122274 they will reduce cases in which our men and women in uniform must drive overland exposing themselves to the risk of ambush land mines and improvised bombs

2122287 i dont really remember what i specifically wrote about but i wrote about my daily life i read a book called letters to a young poet by rainer rilke which tells you to avoid love poems and write about your everyday life and if you cant find enough poetry in it dont blame your life blame yourself

2122289 were fully expecting that the first network dvr systems will have every parameter set to be like the rs dvr
2122290 if theres discrete storage required for every customer thats going to be quite a lot of disk you need
2122291 i think what will happen is people will realize that you dont have to force everyone to have different copies of the same program
2122292 it doesnt hurt the content owners any more to have shared storage in a network dvr than everybody having their recordings in their set tops
2122293 but they figured out how to make it work the cable industry is very good at resolving these issues
2122294 now it doesnt make a difference where i set up my recording and where i view my recording
2122295 i believe that rajan is one of the most talented executives in the india it industry today he has the right mix of strategy and execution which is essential for our continued growth and also brings a very energizing combination of passion belief in people and most importantly an appetite for big challenges i am confident that rajan will help lead microsoft india to new heights of excellence

2122299 is there a business case for using twitter part 2 communication tool
2122300 good things come to those who wait and wait and wait
2122301 weve said for a long time that a centralized network dvr is a better engineering solution than having hard drives all over everybodys home
2122302 if this particular court case is upheld we will deploy that
2122303 if you talk to a bunch of lawyers this is a lot more complicated than the headlines appear

2122340 the premier has said all along we need to be in beijing as the canadian olympic committee has asked us to be to compete against the other bid cities with the full backing of all levels of government
2122341 and we have that now so were looking forward to going and putting the best case forward for a winning bid
2122342 chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists

2122347 we have seven years to ensure that our country and our city are ready to host the best olympic games in the history of the world
2122348 hosting the olympics would both mark chinas triumphant arrival as a fully respectable country on the world scene and demonstrate exactly that to the population at home
2122349 seize the opportunity of a century to realise the dream of a century
2122350 it will show that china is now powerful not backward
2122351 china devised the slogan one world one dream for the olympics but the rest of the world doesnt share that dream with them
2122352 we do not have the gang culture that places like london have but it is still a problem last night alone there were three incidents in the area involving knives
2122353 people carry knives for lots of reasons they are often ill on drugs or are psychologically damaged in some way sometimes young people just think its cool
2122354 that is why we have been into pretty much every school in the northumbria force area and will be going in again

2122372 people struggle with memory loss as a part of healthy ageing or as a result of depression or dementia its important to be able to tell the difference
2122373 our research has shown that a healthy brain follows the principles of small worldness that govern social network sites such as facebook
2122374 we found that in alzheimers disease these hub regions are targeted first which may explain memory loss and confusion the characteristics of the disease
2122375 by releasing these emails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of all peer to peer users the emails contains sic information about the various tactics and technical solutions for tracking p2p users and disrupt p2p services we hope this is enough to create a viable defense to the tactics used by these companies
2122376 how comfortable are you guys that your email server is free of uh other eyes
2122377 oh yeah yeah weve checked out our email server and our email server itself has not been compromised
2122378 in the beginning i had no motivation against monkey defenders
2122379 it wasnt like i want to hack those bastards but then i found something and the good nature in me said these guys are not right im going to destroy them
2122380 we showed him how we could block it from getting out onto the internet
2122381 most users are likely individuals who in the absence of file sharing would not have bought the music they downloaded
2122382 roughly half of all p2p tracks were downloaded because individuals wanted to hear songs before buying them or because they wanted to avoid purchasing the whole bundle of songs on the associated cds and roughly one quarter were downloaded because they were not available for purchase
2122383 online piracy has got to be stopped the biggest spear in the neck of the pirates will be a being vigilant b prosecuting and c in a way making fun of them finding a way to say thats not anything but cool if you had people who the young people respect in this industry brad pitt george clooney shia labeouf if these guys did public service announcements that said dont steal stealings not cool i think you can go a long way toward stopping this
2122384 the music companies were put on earth to make the video companies seem like visionaries
2122385 the owners of the pirate bay willfully and unlawfully exploit and misappropriate both princes and the village peoples intellectual property and infringe on their rights of publicity blah blah blah

2122395 our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the dvd screeners and put the movie online for all to download people like our movie and are talking about it all thanks to piracy on the net
2122396 in the future i will not complain about file sharing you have helped put this little movie on the map when i make my next picture i just may upload the movie on the net myself
2122397 as a filmmaker i love that people love the movie and have seen the movie but as a person who literally has a hunk of his own life savings in the movie i dont want to be ripped off by people illegally downloading the movie some of these downloaders want to believe theyre fighting the man but were all just people who work for a living
2122398 max told officers that he was going to the shop
2122399 he had his big brothers shoes on which were twice the size of his
2122400 for this reason we owe it to every child to put him in communication with
2122401 the driver of the corsa may have some vital information to help us piece together the events which led up to the crash
2122402 this driver initially stopped at the scene but left before police arrived without leaving any contact details
2122403 there was a storm going through the area at the time there was some extreme weather
2122404 the local emergency services are based a couple of miles away from the crash site
2122405 were looked after responded to very quickly and assessed very quickly and the ones that did not require medical treatment at a hospital were taken to a community centre nearby where they were assessed by our medics
2122406 it was a head on collision and the front of the bus has been destroyed
2122407 there is a big rock wall at the side of the road and the vehicle seemed to have been wedged in against it

2122412 we cant believe they arent coming they are boycotting and marginalising the families
2122413 we decided that we would support the main event on the friday
2122414 that is the official one the one on the sunday is not official
2122415 theres a whole range of issues ive got problems with
2122416 the whole wording issue and some of the politicians that are going to be there i think theyve the council have made a real mess of it altogether
2122417 they certainly didnt consult with us about the event there are more than ten families who wont be there
2122418 i have no objection with a family going its their choice but i certainly wont be part of it
2122419 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary
2122420 i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently

2122422 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2122423 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2122424 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2122425 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2122426 if you are experiencing difficulties the advice would be to contact your lender at the earliest opportunity

2122429 one of the untold stories about the labor movement is that were a mix were a family we have republicans independents and democrats its pretty evenly divided amongst those lines
2122430 were really committed to taking back the statehouse in ohio as a number one priority of our affiliate unions and the afl cio to make sure the gavel is in the hands of a pro worker party the democrats in november
2122431 weve targeted races throughout the state to pick up so we can change the power in columbus
2122432 ohio really is the bar what we do in ohio we do in other states ohio usually takes the lead and moves those things in an aggressive way to the worksite
2122433 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio
2122434 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2122435 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2122436 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2122468 in acest moment pe piata exista foarte multi cumparatori cei mai multi dintre ei au deja creditele aprobate de catre banci insa nu cumpara sperand intr un miracol un pret mai mic peste o saptamana sau peste o luna
2122469 va fi surprinzator pentru multi dintre acesti cumparatori sa constate ca proprietatile nu s au ieftinit pentru ca nu au cum atata timp cat costurile sunt imense
2122470 piata imbraca doua forme in momentul de fata in prima dintre ele gasim cumparatorii care alimentati de atatea zvonuri nu mai achizitioneaza proprietati in speranta ca poate maine sau peste o luna va fi mai ieftin pe de alta parte dezvoltatorii nu stiu cum ar putea sa construiasca mai ieftin tinand cont ca terenurile sunt foarte scumpe materialele de constructii se scumpesc in fiecare zi forta de munca devine din ce in ce mai scumpa si peste toate trebuie sa aiba si un profit decent care sa le faca afacerea viabila

2122473 we do have power between 1 and 4 pm but that is lunchtime for offices and no customers come
2122474 earlier we earned around rs 10 000 daily but now that is down to around rs 3 000 our users are mostly students who urgently need printouts or downloads in the morning before they go to school or college but the caf cant function between 9 30 am and 1 pm the slot from 4 to 7 30 pm when the students are free is again one when we go without power
2122475 the mill runs from 9 30 am to 1 pm after which power goes off till 4 pm with the mill shut between 2 and 4 pm we lose out on only one hour of business

2122482 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
2122483 the extraordinary lengths to which nottley has gone in order to avoid prosecution shows just how calculated his actions were
2122484 with this kind of minimalist funding the canadian military will remain overstretched with only enough capacity to sustain 1 000 troops on the battlefield in a single location and no more
2122485 two per cent budgetary increases will become decreases in any year that the militarys inflation rate is above two per cent and it is safe to predict that this will happen every year into the foreseeable future
2122486 mr kenny in particular has too much time on his hands and is engaging in a sort of mid summer drive by smear in an attempt at self aggrandizement
2122487 theyve gotten away with taking 20 years of spending adding up the cumulative total and pretending its something theyre going to do in this minority government

2122489 christian bale comes out from underneath the fence and walks outside and up into the barracks all the way through all the americans and gets to the end with john malkovich
2122490 its this six minute steadicam shot and it gets to the end to my part and i have one line in the movie and i screw it up and im like ohhh ohh ohh sorry sorry sorry should we cut or
2122491 we laughed about that story years later with spielberg but it was really one of those moments i really screwed up
2122492 hes gonna call me up and say i want to do a great big movie with you but i want you to have the highest risk factor and i want to maybe put you up to ridicule and have people hate you for doing something that you should have known was wrong to do
2122493 im sure there are people who out of context wonder about it and i totally respect that
2122494 because out of context youd say whats going on here but we were always clear when we were making the movie what was our intention and where the humor was coming from that youd have an actor who goes too far who takes himself so seriously believes that he can transform into any role and is wrongheaded
2122495 he used to be irish he became australian while we were shooting
2122496 so it was funny when he dropped character because he still had the makeup on and youd get this irish accent out of context but then it seemed funnier as we worked on it that he stayed in character so that developed into his issue in the movie that he was sort of afraid to drop character
2122497 but then dale got another job he went off to do the miniseries the pacific with spielberg and downey ended up showing up late because he was still shooting iron man so the whole boot camp thing just became a cast dinner
2122498 i give him a lot of s for it but i love the guy and i respect him immensely people were dropping like flies
2122499 hes not mean spirited thats not ben its just hes obsessed with the idea of delivering the best product he can

2122507 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2122508 es war f r mich eine tolle zeit im dfb team und in den vergangenen jahren auch immer der kontakt zur heimat
2122509 sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg er hat viel f r den deutschen fu ball geleistet und war f r mich stets ein wichtiger ansprechpartner

2122518 those jobs are on the chopping block because sen mccain and his campaign were involved in a deal that resulted in control of those positions being shifted to a foreign corporation and theres no getting around that

2122834 its very clear that she did not steal any documents im categorical on that front
2122835 there will be one persons point of view but it will be supported by external documented facts

2122871 i was running round screaming my house my house but there was nothing i could do

2122873 in sderot you live in constant fear of losing everything if a bomb falls on your house then you go away from that and you come here and then this happens its ironic

2122885 threats against bush redacted to leave open the implication that the threat against obama was racially motivated
2122886 never on cnns blog but on many conservative blogs i have seen down right racism and hatred statement toward obama the statement were not because they disagreed with obamas position on the issues but only because he is black and nothing more

2122888 de todas mis pel culas es la que mejor ha sido recibida en este pa s una de las cosas que me hac a m s ilusi n era la cr tica del new yorker y finalmente les ha gustado
2122889 obviamente no es batman pero es una pel cula para pensar para paladear
2122890 hay un miedo muy grande en los estudios a correr riesgos pero ese es precisamente el peligro no correr riesgos creo que estamos consiguiendo atontar al espectador por lo que cada vez tiene menos criterio
2122891 videojuego con un ritmo enloquecido y de frialdad brutal sin tiempo para digerir lo que sucede
2122892 es una de las mejores pel culas que ha hecho pen lope demuestra pasi n e inteligencia natural
2122893 suena muy mal decirlo pero todas las interpretaciones son maravillosas y creo que los actores lo merecen pero soy muy fatalista y conozco la industria depender a de muchas cosas del momento si se dan las condiciones podr a ocurrir
2122894 soy una controladora y me hab an advertido de que trabajar para un estudio era distinto pero yo ten a una visi n determinada de c mo ten a que ser la pel cula hubo confrontaci n pero me han respetado mucho
2122895 quiz si hubiese sido mi primera producci n me habr a achantado a la hora de decir lo que quiero
2122896 lo que quiero es seguir contando historias sea donde sea a m me sueltas en mongolia y hago una pel cula
2122897 it was disappointing obviously to get a game pitched so well up until the ninth and to have the outcome go the way it did in terms of a home run hit walk it was tough i think its something that tony dunc and i will talk about tomorrow strategize and see what makes the most sense you cant just keep giving games away like that
2122898 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
2122899 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
2122900 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
2122901 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
2122902 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
2122903 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
2122904 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
2122905 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
2122906 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
2122907 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
2122908 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
2122909 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
2122910 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
2122911 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
2122912 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
2122913 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

2122929 the use of real life newscasters as actors playing themselves
2122930 the use of dirty tricks by both major political parties

2122945 even if you never met him you know this guy
2122946 hes the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
2122947 it would have been fantastic to have got the trophy last week in front of our own fans at the liberty stadium
2122948 that didnt happen so weve just got to celebrate with the fans who are here
2122949 what happened with leeds was unfortunate ive not seen anything like it before and i dont think well see anything like it again

2122951 we ran out of games and it was never in our own hands

2122959 in the case of our gaming in indonesia marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
2122960 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
2122961 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great gaming in indonesia business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
2122962 starting up any gaming in indonesia business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
2122963 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the gaming in indonesia product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
2122964 with the advent of the information super highway gaming in indonesia firms have entered into a new era where sales can be generated at the click of a mouse
2122965 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new gaming in indonesia work released by prof rohr ahlin and it is high time for new ideas
2122966 this is like buddy holly the day the music died it is sad for all sports fans because this guy was not done it is not that he was hanging on
2122967 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though we felt like i think all the parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation
2122968 but the relationship got to the point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens and neither party is at fault but you move forward
2122969 i think were all sad to see brett favres career as a packer end but we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way thats good for the team and good for brett
2122970 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
2122971 and if we would have got to that point then our conversation would have continued and it did not get to that point
2122972 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
2122973 id love to see him have the time of his life
2122974 i told him he could help with the quarterbacks but i dont want any new plays
2122975 this is important to him he recognizes that when you step out of whats happened and everything he has a very positive opinion about the fans the experience hes had with his family he didnt want to do this to his teammates any more he felt it clearly went on long enough
2122976 initially failed to notify the about the destruction of the tapes even though citigroup learned in mid june that recordings of its auction rate desk had been destroyed
2122977 citi has acted in good faith and in the best interests of our clients both before and since auctions began to fail and there is simply no basis for claims to the contrary
2122978 suspended all recycling of tapes and preserved all existing tapes

2122983 she has shown tremendous strength of character over the last 10 days and she is thoroughly deserving of this positive outcome
2122984 il ny aura pas le moindre jour de coalition avec le fp de heinz christian strache
2122985 there was no negotiation there was never any substantive talk of what they would take
2122986 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2122987 green bay never told us what they were interested in trading him for
2122988 really it never got to any of that he wasnt a free agent we never believed they were going to release him that wasnt their intention it wasnt that type of process
2122989 i said we never believed they were going to trade him to the buccaneers
2122990 were going to listen to peoples thoughts if theres a way itll benefit the buccaneers
2122991 coach gruden and jeffs relationship goes back a long way the american way is competition i dont think any outside forces are going to affect this football team
2122992 this notion of victory just distracts us from the task at hand losing
2122993 i have to wonder what the average non news junkie american thinks of the media surely they must be noticing that currently the media is not only embargoing a newsworthy story about a onetime democratic presidential and vice presidential candidate having a love child and arranging a massive donor funded cover up of that but the media is all but embargoing the fact that we have either largely won or almost entirely won the war in iraq
2122994 the truth is president bush has been consistent in defining victory bottom line its leaving behind a functional and democratic iraq capable of defending itself from internal and external threats iraq is on an irreversible path to meeting those goals
2122995 functional democratic capable of defending itself from internal external threats
2122996 we wanted to put our best foot forward we considered what we are the first thing people see when they get here and last thing when they leave so we wanted to make a good impression
2122997 we have these signs in the terminal and the concourses weve replaced the carpeting in the terminal and concourse a and c and installed the moving walkway in concourse c
2122998 all of us looked at the list of opportunities both historic and current and we wanted to present a focus on denvers rich history and diversity

2123111 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
2123112 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
2123113 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
2123114 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
2123115 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most

2123366 when a scientist stacks the deck a review of diana e h russells
2123367 i have come to dislike talking about the effects of pornography with people who have not seen it for themselves
2123368 material that combines sex and or the exposure of genitals with abuse or degradation in a manner that appears to endorse condone or encourage such behavior
2123369 5 of the cartoons and 10 of the pictorials were sexually violent
2123370 the triple x videos had a higher frequency of mutual i e egalitarian sexual depictions than the adult videos 72 versus 12 9
2123371 concerned individuals with the potentially misleading impression that those who produce pornography hold the monopoly on violent and sexually violent materials
2123372 because it is important to know the proclivities and the state of mind of those who read and view pornography i will start by discussing some of the data on males propensity to rape
2123373 proclivities and state of mind of those who read and view porn
2123374 reason for great concern when those who feel aroused by pornography or racism become advocates or defenders of it
2123375 randomly assigned to view either a rape version or a mutually consenting version of a slide audio presentation
2123376 the rape version of the slide audio presentation is typical of what is seen in pornography
2123377 what is objectionable about pornography then is its abusive and degrading portrayal of females and female sexuality not its sexual content or explicitness
2123378 pornography clearly does not cause rape as it seems safe to assume that some pornography consumers do not rape women and that many rapes are unrelated to pornography
2123379 among the junior high school students in jennings bryants study 72 of the males reported that they wanted to try some sexual experiment or sexual behavior that they had seen in their initial exposure to x rated material
2123380 that exposure to non violent pornography causes masculine sex typed males in contrast to androgynous males to view and treat women as a sex object
2123381 encode all cross sex interactions in sexual terms and all members of the opposite sex in terms of sexual attractiveness
2123382 unobtrusive measure of the prevalence of the corresponding fantasy among consumers
2123383 the imagery of pornography tends to correspond to the preexisting fantasy images of the consumer
2123384 feature length film that portrayed violence against women as being justifiable and having positive consequences swept away or the getaway
2123385 psychologists james check and neil malamuth have provided experimental evidence that pornography that is supplemented with sound educational information does not induce the negative effects that would otherwise occur
2123386 warning some of the visuals in this book may cause distress
2123387 subjects who had seen the r rated movies 1 rated the rape victim as significantly more worthless 2 rated her injury as significantly less severe and 3 assigned greater blame to her for being raped than did the subjects who had not seen the films i
2123388 negative consequences to males who exploit women in this situation i e in bondage are improbable since women who are violated while in bondage are unlikely to report such abuses to the police
2123389 moved to tear up several hundred hustler magazines in convenience stores and throughout santa cruz
2123390 the only exception to these rules applies to feminists dedicated to the fight against pornography who are welcome to copy this material free of charge in pursuit of their anti pornography work
2123391 i did not attempt to obtain permission from the pornographers for several reasons
2123392 in light of the fact that one of the most popular tactics used against the porn industry is to tie up all its resources in legal battles in the hopes that the production companies will go bankrupt i have a fitting response to russells book to suggest the pornographers whose images she has stolen should consider suing her for copyright violations
2123393 includes the right to publish the material necessary to show that pornography is harmful to women

2123520 this car continues to grow on me which may be a reflection of how well it is designed
2123521 few rattles or creaks solid on even the worst surfaces

2123524 the zx pampers the driver with comfort and refined surroundings
2123525 its so good you have to look for things to pick on
2123526 its not as luxurious and well appointed as the zx but its such a kick to drive
2123527 a road hugger of the first order feels like it will stick and stick and stick
2123528 just keep applying more lock and more throttle and it keeps turning and tracking
2123529 you need a delicate touch and discipline to keep from cranking in too much lock
2123530 when the going gets rough this car feels every ounce of its 3655 lb
2123531 on the power it understeers just a hair if i went into a turn and the back end started moving around id get on the power and the rear would stick right in just like the race car does so thats a good feature i was real surprised with the brakes
2123532 i didnt get on them super hard but i could get on them anywhere and i was always braking too early on braking there was a bit of trailing throttle oversteer if i went into a corner real deep and got on the brakes the back end started to squat and move a little but the tail didnt come around and it was very controllable thats the advantage of the a arm rear suspension on the race car it eliminates the toe changes that induce trailing throttle oversteer
2123533 with the g forces generated on the banking i was running about 130 mph up there the car naturally felt a little undersprung the car got a little light but not to the point where it started to wander
2123534 the radials roll over on the sidewalls a little and thats the thing i liked about the t as they didnt squat down when you cornered them hard but these tires stick pretty well and are very predictable they dont break away suddenly and thats an important consideration for driving on the street

2123575 engineers unveiled the latest revised routes for the proposed toll supported baton rouge loop on thursday that reinstates the far northern corridor between zachary and baker at the same time the new plan eliminates a proposed route for the northern bypass that would have run through denham springs and along florida boulevard and airline highway in east baton rouge parish to the south the latest plan eliminates a controversial corridor that would have run through prairieville and spanish lake in ascension parish at this point it appears that the loop will cross the amite river north of port vincent run south of gonzales and cross interstate 10 near the old sorrento rest area closed by the state a few years ago

2123621 globalmente no me atrevo a decir un n mero de medallas pero en cuanto a las opciones serias creo que hay de ocho a once hay gente que va a estar en finales compitiendo por las medallas y suele salir estad sticamente un cuarenta o un cincuenta por ciento de eso si sale as perfecto
2123622 las mujeres van a estar aqu muy pero que muy arriba en 1 500 metros en obst culos y en 5 000 metros
2123623 mar a vasco est muy fuerte o bea pascual ambas en 20 km marcha y tambi n est marta dom nguez 3 000 m obst culos que tiene un peque o problema en el gl teo pero luego sale y lo da todo adem s es muy lista
2123624 es una pena la baja de mayte ya que es una gran competidora y ahora las rusas est n como est n ha sido muy mala suerte lo que le ha pasado y lo de su operaci n
2123625 mireia est muy bien est animada tranquila sabe que las dos pruebas que nada habr que nadar cerca del r cord del mundo para las medallas incluso batirlo y est mentalizada para afrontar esto
2123626 es una chica que quiere quedar con todo el mundo bien y a los entrenamientos no falto a ninguno pero estaba bastante estresada de lo que es el descanso hemos estado en jap n ha estado tranquila el periodo especifico lo hemos hecho muy bien
2123627 la clave para ella es el parcial de espalda y braza tiene que procurar que el parcial de mariposa pase con ellas pero muy c modamente que no gaste energ a tontamente a veces querer pasar cinco d cimas m s r pido es un error es importante que cuando pase la espalda no haya perdido el ritmo de carrera
2123628 la espalda lo va a hacer bien la salida hemos intentado mejorarla hemos reducido el nado subacu tico que salga antes a nadar y esto ara a unas d cimas de segundo en los primeros cincuenta metros
2123629 al salir detr s de ellas en mariposa no tiene que cometer el error de querer pillarlas en los primeros 25 metros tiene 50 metros para volver a estar en la carrera tiene que dosificar mucho para la espalda y la braza que ah s que tiene que ir a cara de perro
2123630 en 200 estilos est sexta en el ranking mundial yo la veo bien en las dos pruebas pero el podio va a ser dur simo yo creo que el objetivo la mejora de mireia en 200 estilos tiene que ser de dos segundos y en 400 creo que no ha dado de si lo que ella vale pero no se decantarme por una u otra
2123631 si hubiera sido antes de los estilos a lo mejor no la hubiera nadado pero una vez que haya nadado los estilos en el futuro tambi n tendr muchas opciones
2123632 i know what 40 000 of them sound like ive been in front of them before and tonight again they were fantastic and the leeds fans know that
2123633 that was for them tonight the players would be first to admit that it was a bit of a damp squib on monday night at elland road but i think the fans got the reaction they wanted
2123634 im very proud of the players and pleased for the players
2123635 everything thats been put in front of them theyve dealt with and ive not heard one murmur of complaint
2123636 we move on again slightly closer to the championship i dont want to be a killjoy but nothings been achieved yet
2123637 weve still got to go and try and win a game at wembley
2123638 the ugly side of our game was missing the other night we didnt win any headers or tackles or ugly bouncy balls carlisle were first to most but we reversed it tonight
2123639 and you know what i feel about jon howson hes been an ever present since i arrived and hes a young man with great potential
2123640 we keep drip feeding him information so as not to try and stifle him hes got a lot of raw energy and power so were just going to try and protect him and make him progress as a footballer
2123641 ive been really pleased with them all season because when i came in october they were third in the table and it was a question of i might mess it up instead of moving it on
2123642 although we finished fourth and got beaten in the play offs we showed a real togetherness
2123643 its a small squad and thats probably cost us but the desire and determination of this group of players is top drawer
2123644 tonight we didnt play as well as we did on monday but thats sport leeds did very well and i wish them well in the final

2123676 again this shows mr boccieris penchant for aligning himself with washington insiders and ignoring the interests of the good people of our district
2123677 john boccieris decision to attach himself to the corrupt old guard democrat establishment hardly signals the change and independence the voters of ohio are looking for in this election
2123678 the desperation of sen schuring to disconnect himself with washington insiders is revealing
2123679 he has some nerve to falsely attack me about washington politics while he has karl roves group running radio ads for his campaign maybe he was just repeating bad information from his handlers in washington in which case i hope he will have the honor and decency to admit his mistake issue a public correction to the press and promise to start running his own campaign from now on

2123693 investitorii care migreaza dinspre fondurile de actiuni spre fondurile de obligatiuni au un comportament speculativ acestia se uita in principal la randamente atunci cand aleg sa investeasca faptul ca fondurile de actiuni au raportat performante mult peste cele aduse de obligatiuni in anii trecuti i a orientat pe investitori in special catre fondurile de actiuni acum pe fondul corectiilor bursiere situatia s a inversat
2123694 dupa sapte ani de crestere continua a pietei plasamentele in actiuni nu mai erau percepute de investitori ca riscante pentru ca acestia nu au trecut prin experienta unor corectii de durata asa cum se intampla acum cred ca comportamentul investitorilor se va schimba plasamentele in actiuni vor fi intelese nu doar din perspectiva unui randament potential ci si a riscului de a pierde
2123695 investitorii prefera sa vada un trend consolidat de crestere a bursei pentru a investi in fondurile de actiuni cu riscul chiar de a pierde un moment bun de intrare acest fapt reflecta ca educatia financiara a investitorilor este insuficienta

2123705 in 2009 cifra de afaceri a companiei va creste la 25 mil dolari 16 2 mil euro iar pentru anul urmator prognozam aproximativ aceeasi rata de crestere de aproximativ 5 mil dolari pe an

2123709 en los entrenamientos trabajamos generalmente sobre nosotros mismos y del rival hacemos algo m s espec fico el d a anterior y el mismo d a del partido esto es lo que vamos a hacer con grecia l gicamente cosas nuestras que estamos trabajando nos sirven para grecia y para todo
2123710 lo que todav a no s como solucionar es el d a de alemania porque si tenemos que hablar el d a anterior y el d a del partido no vamos a tener que levantar a las cuatro de la ma ana porque es la primera vez que vamos a jugar a las nueve
2123711 somos conscientes de que lo estamos haciendo bien y de que lo hemos hecho bien pero tenemos que hacerlo bien de ahora en adelante y a n as est la dificultad de los rivales el primer rival grecia es indiscutiblemente muy dif cil
2123712 lo estoy viviendo como lo tiene que vivir un entrenador ocupado en su equipo y en los rivales con la m xima ilusi n y sabiendo que tenemos detr s a toda espa a y que el momento del baloncesto espa ol es bueno pero hay que refrendarlo con hechos no con palabras
2123713 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y hay mucha calidad vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas no habl ndolas
2123714 son muy listos jugando son muy vivos ese tipo de jugador que est pendiente de todo se desenvuelven en ese nivel especialmente dimitris diamantidis y theodoros papalukas luego tienen jugadores muy grandes que son tiradores de fuera eso nos crea problemas ese juego inteligente y los apoyos que tienen en ioanis burusis costas tsartsaris y antonis fotsis capaces de defender dentro y tirar desde el per metro hace m s peligrosos a los exteriores
2123715 es cierto que espa a gan a grecia en madrid con muchas dificultades en la semifinal del europeo a falta de tres minutos bamos perdiendo ellos adem s de la preparaci n han tenido competici n el preol mpico lo que han demostrado lo han demostrado en competici n oficial y nosotros en amistosos
2123716 se puede contar con todos los jugadores ya que algunos que han tenido alg n problema muscular como ra l l pez o alg n problema articular como juan carlos navarro est n bien
2123717 hemos llegado al nivel que quer amos eso ahora hay que demostrarlo pero es el nivel que quer amos para empezar los juegos el primer partido de una competici n tiene un plus de mentalidad m s dif cil es muy importante el resultado pero hay que convenir que queremos seguir mejorando durante los juegos y que el primer objetivo es clasificarnos entre los cuatro primeros descargamos la tensi n en cada partido individual no ser igual si alcanzamos los cruces

2123810 i said i havent heard of any of these actors what they have they done
2123811 then i ended up just falling in love with all of them
2123812 to be honest that was kind of the pull it was such a bizarro scenario it was so bizarre i kind of almost couldnt get my head around it but i thought god this is really going to be an experience this is a whole different culture this is a different part of america that i havent experienced i dont know this world and i was intrigued and it turned out to be a positive
2123813 this is a guys comedy road movie and they need a reason to drive the story and its tobys love for this girl
2123814 life in the big city had brought home to her what home was and he was a part of that
2123815 i was actually amazed at how relaxed toby could be hes a really confident guy but hes also humble
2123816 he is very in the moment and actually quite good at improvising ive worked with professional actors way less instinctive than him it was a very nice surprise
2123817 as an actor you get used to being uncomfortable if youre not in freezing cold water in the middle of winter then youre bound and gagged
2123818 i mean i didnt know how big all these guys were i knew who willie nelson was but pretty much everybody else i didnt know and so i was learning as i made the movie and there were all these wonderful iconic country western guys who did cameos and toby would be so in awe and hed speak so highly of them and educate me
2123819 they would sing and then rodney was always one joke after another so it was hard to stay serious and then once we got into politics it was all over michael salomon the director would be screaming at us to get to set and act
2123820 they really persevered and i think hopefully it will actually work out well it was a tough shoot in many ways but everyone was a real champion about it and the pittsburgh crew was absolutely gorgeous i never really got to feel the pain

2123828 in an ideal world wed have over 200 people we have about 120 so if we get another 50 60 more that will sweeten it
2123829 the rooneys have been very generous to allow us to shoot there
2123830 the students learned just an insane amount about what people had to do to secure our rights
2123831 we interviewed about 35 people and all of them were in some way shape or form participants in what was happening in the late 30s until the late 60s in that region
2123832 students could see firsthand that when someone has their rights taken away ive given up some of my rights too
2123833 they worked really hard it was a 16 day trip and they worked 12 hours a day they were in production for real
2123834 were children of the 80s so we wanted to make the kind of movie we used to sneak out of bed in the middle of the night to watch on usas up all night

2123838 pakistan are the team ranked just above us in the pool but we beat them in the 2006 world cup

2123840 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2123841 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2123842 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2123843 i like when you focus on making movies you make movies and people go to see them
2123844 but theres this whole other industry thats been created which the world hasnt quite adjusted to or caught up to or figured out its the same thing with copyright and all kinds of other things where things are going around that im sure at some point will become more civilized im just waiting like brad pitt and angelina jolie ill go out and adopt twins if theyll pay me 14 million to do it
2123845 why earn money by making art earning money by making money is much easier

2123848 i want to see justice done to the three ruf commanders i was a school going boy at the time when i was captured by the rebels and mercilessly amputated now most of the rebels have been rehabilitated and given skills training while i and other amputees languish with our scars we know of huge donor assistance coming through for us but we never receive it this is just too unfair and so if these people are punished that will be justice for us the victims
2123849 the people of sierra leone indeed need reconciliation however the atrocities committed by the ruf deserve maximum punishment this country cannot condone impunity anymore because we do not want a repeat of our immediate ugly past
2123850 we agreed to a peace pact and the war was brought to a close i dont believe the trial of the three gentlemen at the special court is in the good spirit of national reconciliation i believe they should be released and let bygones be bygones
2123851 the special court has an agreement with some countries in the region which have promised to provide detention facilities for those convicted these facilities have to meet international standards and as far as it is now sierra leones prisons are not up to such standards so those found guilty would have to serve out their sentences outside of sierra leone
2123852 i dont think it is wise keeping those people in our jails they are very dangerous and we have witnessed many incidents where the prisons are broken into and hard core criminals set free only to unleash terror on us let them serve their sentences somewhere else that will make me feel good

2123883 investitorii care migreaza dinspre fondurile de actiuni spre fondurile de obligatiuni au un comportament speculativ acestia se uita in principal la randamente atunci cand aleg sa investeasca faptul ca fondurile de actiuni au raportat performante mult peste cele aduse de obligatiuni in anii trecuti i a orientat pe investitori in special catre fondurile de actiuni acum pe fondul corectiilor bursiere situatia s a inversat
2123884 dupa sapte ani de crestere continua a pietei plasamentele in actiuni nu mai erau percepute de investitori ca riscante pentru ca acestia nu au trecut prin experienta unor corectii de durata asa cum se intampla acum cred ca comportamentul investitorilor se va schimba plasamentele in actiuni vor fi intelese nu doar din perspectiva unui randament potential ci si a riscului de a pierde
2123885 investitorii prefera sa vada un trend consolidat de crestere a bursei pentru a investi in fondurile de actiuni cu riscul chiar de a pierde un moment bun de intrare acest fapt reflecta ca educatia financiara a investitorilor este insuficienta

2123995 how would you feel if missiles were fired from senegal into mauritania
2123996 wouldnt you defend your citizens you have shown that it is possible to be pro palestinian without being anti israel
2123997 only a peace agreement will shut the mouths of those who are opposed in the arab world and in particular in mauritania to ties with israel
2123998 the military advocate general determined that the said incident reflects a severe moral failure of command and requires that both the officer and soldier involved will be tried in a military court
2123999 the army treats the shooting at point blank range of a bound man only as inappropriate behavior it disgraces the values which it pretends to uphold
2124000 was serious and reflected a failure of command and values even though the battalion commander did not intend for real shots to be fired only that it be used as a scare tactic
2124001 purpose of israeli nuclear weapons not often stated but obvious is their use on the united states
2124002 it is dangerous in the extreme that in the cauldron of animosities that we call the middle east one nation has armed itself ostensibly with stockpiles of nuclear weapons perhaps numbering in the hundreds and that inspires other nations to do so
2124003 could have an impact on us for the next 100 years
2124004 irans achievement is creating an image of itself as a scary superpower when its really a paper tiger
2124005 to work toward a political and diplomatic settlement under which iran will maintain the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
2124006 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian programme is geared toward making weapons
2124007 with high confidence that in fall 2003 teheran halted its nuclear weapons programme
2124008 prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran
2124009 this sounded an awful lot like it was calling for a blockade which is an act of war
2124010 are supporters of res 362 asleep at the wheel or are they just anxious to drag us into another illegal war
2124011 howard berman chair of the house committee on foreign affairs has indicated that he has no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against iran i will withdraw my support for the bill if this change is not made
2124012 over the course of thirty years there hasnt been one act of revenge on the part of or on behalf of any victim that has always been how we have conducted ourselves and it is exactly how we behaved in the courtroom today
2124013 some small groups talk of independence they talk of separation and autonomy brothers and sisters the historic fight of our people is for self determination for the liberation of our people we cannot think of separation nor division
2124014 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2124015 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2124016 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2124017 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2124018 no return is one of the most original and inspiring modern bands on the french metal scene blending traditional 80s thrash and progressive death metal with futuristic industrial metal the group delivers a truly phenomenal mixture of power and passion machinery the bands fifth full length release remains one of their finest offerings bringing a heavy dose of modern metal annihilation the album was released in 2002 and soon it was clear that this was the bands best material yet filled with brutal riffing light speed drumming and harsh passionate vocals the album brings a phenomenal mixture of old school bay area thrash metal and cybernetic industrial sounds making up for a truly unique atmosphere the listener gets stomped right from the beginning with such ferocious tracks as virus the gothenburg inspired disillusion and violator which was dubbed by some reviewers a perfect mix between old fear factory and kreator but one of the most interesting highlights of the record is definitely no returns cover version of secret face by the legendary death an amazingly original interpretation of a truly brilliant song lyrically machinery is a cybernetic concept album portraying futuristic vision of death and annihilation in a world overrun by rebellious machines its no wonder that the music press often compared this lp to soul of a new machine by fear factory but also to sepulturas arise and entombeds left hand path without question no returns fifth opus is one of the most extraordinary releases on the modern metal scene

2124025 politicians have been throwing around all kinds of ideas in response to the skyrocketing energy prices from the rethinking of nuclear power to pushing biofuels and more renewables and ending the ban on offshore drilling

2124038 a vietnam vet similar approach and somebody i respect in a similar fashion
2124039 what hes doing on climate change in california is very important and significant there are things i dont agree with him on but hes taken leadership on a very difficult issue and we havent seen that kind of leadership in washington

2124042 now were going after volume by offering any and all of our factory or dealer installed options to those who already own a corvette and who have only a few thousand dollars to spend
2124043 people think of us as turbo guys but were just engine guys
2124044 because it costs less sounds good and generally will run forever
2124045 is that unless youre working with your partner chevrolet youll never develop an engine thats both powerful and compliant
2124046 i told her it was neither turbocharged nor supercharged but normally aspirated
2124047 brembo cringed when we said wed use stock brakes at the rear so in the future well be offering those on our road cars too
2124048 you can set ride height correctly adjust pitch angle front to rear and crossweight the car compensate for loading on one wheel by altering the loading on the opposite wheel
2124049 its the best 2900 you can spend on a corvette
2124050 the power this engine has from 4000 to 7000 rpm makes you forget all those fidgety little corvette annoyances and makes you want to put every person you know into the passenger seat go out to a deserted road and impress them with what the cr 1 will do
2124051 iran s leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israel s conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

2124179 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2124180 i thank freedoms watch for giving me one more chance to tell people about my fight against ohio gas tax increases and my plan to immediately lower fuel costs
2124181 im just wondering when theyll finally get around to having voters call kirk schuring and ask him why he raised their gas taxes
2124182 my energy plan would bring down gas prices immediately by releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve closing legal loopholes for energy speculators and making oil companies drill on the untapped u s lands and coastal waters they already control
2124183 we also need a rapid transition to home grown alternative energy sources that would create thousands of green collar ohio jobs while freeing america from dependence on oil forever
2124184 this big money washington special interest group doesnt really care about our high fuel costs theyre just trying to elect one more george bush style politician whos taken tens of thousands of dollars from oil executives and will do their bidding in congress
2124185 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio

2124249 because it seems that senator obama has made his decision to offer the slot on the ticket to another candidate we believe that continuing to ask him to pick hillary is no longer helpful to our partys chances of winning in november
2124250 theres a bottleneck on the transmission grid now in southwest wisconsin nelson dewey 3 relieves that bottleneck and allows for greater importing of power from the west
2124251 makes no sense as it is too expensive to build
2124252 i live a carbon neutral life and both of my businesses are carbon neutral
2124253 what is it is not a self contained film so much as a jumping off point for crispin glover to personally engage the audience without his exigesis its well not a bad film perhaps but definitely an incomplete and unsatisfying one with it its a good night out that leaves you with plenty to chew over on the way home
2124254 if they had a meaningful vote i have no idea who would win
2124255 but i know that if sen obama were sure he would win there wouldnt be a negotiation
2124256 what they have to do is make it possible for people to say to themselves that there was a fair and correct process
2124257 but you know hillary clinton has been vetted during the last 18 months
2124258 the obama campaign is obviously very familiar with her record and background shes in many respects the most vetted person in america over the last 30 years so i think that they probably have a pretty good sense of a lot of the information they need to make a decision about her
2124259 shed be a huge asset i think shed be a great addition
2124260 they ask for a lot of stuff ill leave it there
2124261 the decision and timetable for the best person to help sen obama lead the country is entirely up to him all of us who support sen obama have been asked to direct questions about his choice for vice president to the campaign
2124262 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
2124263 under no circumstances will i be a candidate for vice president
2124264 i think the obama campaign is likely casting a wide net at least initially
2124265 i hate to use this word but its fascist and thats the approach theyre taking to silence any hillary clinton supporters
2124266 barack obama wants to give his acceptance speech in a stadium because he intends to minimize any pro hillary supporter dissent its not because he wants to include more people he knows that if they pull any shenanigans at convention the hillary delegates will walk out and they dont want that to be seen or heard theyre bringing as many obama supporters as they can to fill that stadium its fascism
2124267 the seeds of discontent for the birth of the puma just say no deal movement were planted during baracks poor performances at the debates the media assault on clinton after iowa obamas arrogance on the campaign trail and the dncs selective application of its own rules
2124268 we said we are not falling in line just because obama and david axelrod and the dnc were saying all right this is over lets all get behind barack obama
2124269 we formed this coalition to give people time to say look everything is still on the table
2124270 on june 8th the coalition was born and within 24 hours we were on fox news
2124271 we felt reassured after that meeting that come november wed be voting for mccain but we still havent made that choice we want him to work for our vote
2124272 a lot of us still want hillary to get the nomination but we all agree that none of us want obama to be the next president
2124273 were letting the democratic national committee and other party leaders know that puma just say no deal members are serious were not going to take this lightly and were prepared to vote for john mccain if need be
2124274 they are worried they saw these past few weeks how much money were still raising for hillary clinton originally they said hillary has until the convention to pay off her debt if she wants to be on the roll call well then we started making money for her and then they moved it up to july 15th so we started making a lot of money for her
2124275 we started an initiative just before the 4th of july to raise money for hillary and so far weve raised approximately 10 million sources tell us thats less than 5 million away from being in the black by this weekend hillarys debt will be finished
2124276 were doing this on our own we dont want the dnc to use her debt as a strong arm tactic to keep her or her supporters from having a voice at the convention all of us are contributing what we can none of us want barack obama to be the next president
2124277 some of their superstars are now having to spend all of their time addressing us specifically
2124278 donna braziles superdelegate and dnc rules committee member job now is fighting the pumas ed rendell created a group called hound to address the pumas so some of their best people are having to devote all of their time and energy just to address us
2124279 cnn did a poll at the beginning of june that showed 1 of every 5 clinton supporters would not vote for obama well just one month later thats now 1 in 3 so were getting our numbers up and were growing strong and if the dncs not worried about us then theyre clueless as to this movement
2124280 in the last two weeks weve seen obama go back on his campaign promises fisa campaign finance especially the iraq war
2124281 it hasnt hit the ground yet but we want to target down ticket democrats who have been complicit in the dncs dealings these past few months youll probably be hearing more about that soon some of obamas original supporters are leaving him eight super delegates left obama this week people are realizing obama will be a dead weight to them and thats why these eight delegates have switched back over to hillarys column and im expecting therell be more to follow
2124282 hes only the presumptive nominee and hes doing everything he can the dnc is doing everything it can to shove hillary out of the process when she has received more votes than any primary candidate in history
2124283 on this road five miles south is green spring home of governor sir william berkeley bacon the rebel occupied it in 1676 cornwallis after moving from williamsburg by this road on july 4 1781 was attacked by lafayette near green spring on july 6 1781 anthony wayne was the hero of this fight

2124310 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july in addition credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience in july we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves given this volatility and the build up of our reserve as well as the uncertainties inherent in the u s economy and the housing market we are taking a series of additional actions that reflect our ongoing focus on conserving and enhancing our capital as well as managing our credit risk through the balance of this cycle
2124311 maywand is to our knowledge an insurgent logistical node where things like bombs get made and moved to other districts
2124312 so we certainly anticipate that seizing bomb making supplies in maywand will have an effect of what will show up in zahri in the future
2124313 convincing the people of afghanistan there is a legitimate and viable option in supporting the government
2124314 and based on finds and some of the site exploitation going on any insurgents in the area that did manage to get out had to do so in a hurry because they left exploitable material behind
2124315 a large find of ied components homemade explosives a large quantity of that was found and destroyed in place
2124316 we know this area of maywand district is a feeder for other areas
2124317 we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we would be able to cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other areas aside from just localized effect in band e timor
2124318 the initial injuries were reported as serious injuries but they have been upgraded again all the injuries that were reported are all non life threatening
2124319 we were very fortunate nobody was killed in this collision and again most of the injuries were minor in nature the location of the collision itself was close to a community centre where the bus passengers could be removed and taken care of

2124338 his motivation in doing it was to play the futures market so that after the pipeline blew up and the price of oil increased he could make whatever profit on it
2124339 that shows at least in his mind that it was going to be a significant enough impact to affect the financial markets in a way that he would enrich himself
2124340 on its face it sounds like an extremely serious charge on the other hand the only person who had the capability of carrying out this scheme was a convicted felon government informant working with atf
2124341 all of the activity in the united states was to be carried out by the government informant and all of this happened with the governments knowledge
2124342 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2124343 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2124344 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2124345 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2124346 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2124347 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2124348 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2124349 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
2124350 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
2124351 that economy is super strong oil and other commodities have really just helped drive the prices up
2124352 real estate is cyclical in nature in vancouver and victoria i dont think theyve had any type of correction in more than 20 years
2124353 there is a chance things will settle down that there will be more listings on the market and that prices and growth will ease the next year or so
2124354 are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the u s probably not
2124355 but its pretty clear that things are weakening and theyre going to continue weakening for some time
2124356 in the u s a flexible credit plan allowed many people to buy homes who otherwise wouldnt be able to afford it
2124357 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2124358 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2124359 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2124360 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2124361 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2124362 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power

2124364 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2124365 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2124366 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2124367 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital

2124410 ever since the end of last summer we have seen blow away numbers on the job creation side so does two months make a trend
2124411 keep in mind that when economies slow down a little bit a lot of people actually enroll in universities and do self enriching things so that theyre better prepared to compete in a job market
2124412 the only significant job gains were in accommodation and food services where 22 000 people were hired across the country
2124413 the job losses happened in quebec ontario saskatchewan and prince edward island quebec lost 30 000 jobs and the provincial jobless rate rose to 7 4 per cent ontario lost 19 000 jobs although its unemployment rate actually dropped to 6 4 per cent from 6 7 per cent when about 42 000 people left the job market
2124414 thats because many people especially younger part time workers left the workforce

2124449 you know ive gone to a couple of ozzfests i think its been awesome i mean its such a great institution and its done so much for metal in america ozzy and sharon gave us our first big break in america in 1986 i will always respect that theyve been great to us so its cool im psyched should be good fun
2124450 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2124451 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2124452 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2124453 however is that the result of the rfs mandate our conclusion is no
2124454 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2124455 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2124456 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2124457 the epa realized that the facts clearly stood in ethanols corner the bottom line is that ethanol is extending our fuel supply and actually lowering gas prices
2124458 every independent study has confirmed that using corn to make this cheap clean american made fuel has no significant impact on food prices
2124459 when food prices are rising and chicken companies are losing money because of high feed costs it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply
2124460 because the band members did not have long hair let alone big hair many journalists refused to consider the band metal for the same reason many of the radio stations program directors would not pass along medieval s albums to the metal shows and instead considered them as a punk band
2124461 my wife and i have been riding motorcycles a lot lately and she told me i needed to get a skull tattoo

2124463 you want to play semi final football thats what weve talked about
2124464 semi final football is taking kicks at goal when you get a dead setter and you tackle your backside off
2124465 simple as that you play it tough when you have to play it tough which is what they did weve got to play that footy otherwise were going to be sunk
2124466 i suppose if we could have held on to the chip we would have been happy and theyd be disappointed
2124467 thats where the game was won and lost for both sides

2124474 at the load level thought safe during the indian summer
2124475 all this it stuff is neat and all but what we really need is a way to audibly announce things we need a way to interact with the teachers in their rooms and to alert the entire campus dorms included in the event of an emergency
2124476 we worry about those things you hope that your kids make good choices you hope youve raised them right but we always worry
2124477 just having someone whos researched and talked to them about a lot of what theyve read on the internet is sometimes very helpful
2124478 just say hey were going someplace and bring them by
2124479 that tough love means that sometimes if theyre not trustworthy that we have to recognize that and that we have to do what we can to protect them from hurting themselves
2124480 wherever theyve been whatever time they get in they still have to come and kiss mom on the cheek so that she can smell their breath

2124486 it was a lot more difficult today i would think theres not going to be many scores under par
2124487 i am not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back towards the tee the night before the tournament when we have played it as it is in the practice rounds
2124488 it sounds as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2124489 this side seems to be able to do what they have to do to win the game to produce an effort like that was great
2124490 i was a little bit out of control there at the end of the game i didnt really enjoy watching it

2124494 as i left the abortion facility i was told everything will be alright you can go on with your life my life was never the same i immediately went into a deep depression
2124495 i want women and men to know that you can never imagine the pain unless youve gone through it yourself i dont want other women to experience the pain that i have had
2124496 whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision

2124501 can you be profitable yes if you dont take a salary out and you have another job you can live off of
2124502 if you say that because you are born with a certain inclination then it is god given and you should be free to follow that through in your life it doesnt make any logical sense whatever
2124503 you would then have to say that there are many different inclinations with which people are born even if it is true that this is an inherent thing and which people spend their lifetime trying to subdue

2124510 im logged into an administrative account so it cant be permissions doh
2124511 it was pretty intense toward the end of the game as they were pushing a lot of bodies forward there were a lot of scrambles in the box but the referee made the right decisions to let certain plays go on
2124512 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
2124513 its not about having the latest version of whatever program
2124514 if you dont have the eye if you dont that sense of design the program is not going to give it to you
2124515 grant can sometimes swim off other people and so weve been very intentional about how we want to swim each part of his race and been really clear on that
2124516 for grant thats the way well race all along he has to swim his race instead of looking where the pack is he has got to swim it to the plan
2124517 ian probably lifted the game in the 400m because he had gone out so fast and lifted the standard but this time it will be different
2124518 there will be a number of people who will be very close up towards the front but its going to be who can back end that last 150m 200m better than the rest
2124519 hes had a terrific preparation hes stayed healthy he should swim fast
2124520 steph won at the australian trials by nine or 10 seconds but in the us trials it was a race of two or three there so there were people swimming off each other
2124521 i didnt know much about the draft process at the time so i was bouncing some things off of him some numbers to see how he would react and i told him i thought i would go somewhere in the fifth to eighth round most likely the fifth
2124522 he took this to mean i wanted high fifth round money when home and wrote up this report that way and you know that goes out to everyone
2124523 if i played well out there i had a chance to get signed by a team
2124524 coming towards the end of summer i was planning on going back to school for my senior year but the twins and i started talking and we came up with a deal we both liked and here i am

2124526 you cant throw junk at them and expect them to go after it

2124530 look what his last idiot of a yeoman did to him
2124531 what well do is continue to uphold our end of the bargain until such time as sonny comes and talks to us and tells us otherwise
2124532 one of the things weve always been open to is to discuss all his concerns with us put everything on the table
2124533 when weve had that opportunity to talk to both him and his manager previously that playing for all blacks hasnt been said
2124534 we thought we were making progress on issues sonny bill had raised if hes got other issues then raise them with us and well deal with them accordingly
2124535 we expect him to comply with the order of the court
2124536 orders of the court arent like referees telling players to stay on side court orders are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them
2124537 firstly let me say that despite various messages from our legal experts this is certainly not a particularly joyful occasion for the bulldogs
2124538 in fact its relatively sad that were in a position of being in court when what we should be doing is filling stadiums and running our football club
2124539 it is however a victory for the sanctity of a contract its a victory for a commitment that one person makes to another
2124540 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club
2124541 it protects both parties and places responsibilities on both parties
2124542 he had an opportunity today to put his side on what was going to be an important application for him i cant speculate as to why he didnt turn up today
2124543 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2124544 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2124545 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2124546 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2124547 make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall
2124548 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
2124549 i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
2124550 each of us is responsible for how we feel what we wish for and how we decide to approach lifes challenges
2124551 happiness is something that we look for strive for perhaps even struggle for happiness is something that we try to find or more likely something that we try to buy joy is something that we are
2124552 it is your destiny to play an infinity of roles but these roles are not yourself
2124553 desires kept in the heart come true faster than those we constantly broadcast by talking about them or putting demands on others
2124554 real spiritual growth changes a person in a paradoxical way it brings understanding at the same time as it preserves innocence
2124555 be very careful what you set your heart upon for you will surely have it
2124556 that last order i just put in i need you to specify why that is so high

2124563 diablo ii had a lot of little oddities to it that made the experience not as usable i certainly wouldnt want things like dont kill the cow king because weve got to keep the level open we would avoid scenarios like that the secret of a cow level is a cool secret the secret that youre not supposed to kill the king because youll ruin the cow level forever thats a bad secret so we would try to get rid of some of the bad ones

2124582 i tried to take his picture several times but he covered his face with his doctors lab coat
2124583 after a few pictures he got in my face and pointed his finger but did not touch me he complained that i had no right to take his picture i told him i had the right i said this in spanish even though he was talking to me in english i was locked into spanish mode i think my speaking in spanish discouraged him and he turned away and began to enter the clinic i took one or two more pictures of him as he entered
2124584 as he came around the corner i snapped a shot of him i then walked alongside of him and tried to explain why i was doing this because i had received a tip from someone that he might be an unlicensed doctor
2124585 i came around to the front of the vehicle but still on the sidewalk to take a shot he then snapped and began to pursue me he kept demanding the camera and reaching for it and i kept backing off saying no and shielding it from him at some point i fell over and slammed my back into a parking meter pole this impact jarred the camera from my hands or he might have kicked it out of my hands at this point my knuckles are scraped so this is a real possibility at which point he began to stomp on the camera i went after the camera and was able to get it back into my possession at which point he assaulted me again
2124586 got me to the ground and seeking to jar the camera from my hand was hitting me and not finding success put his knee on my throat and choked me at this point i began to yell for help and for someone to call the police since i was aware that there were many witnesses watching the episode one man came up and attempted to remove the camera from my hand as i yelled for help i did not let go and eventually the doctor stopped and made for his car as if to leave but didnt this he did once or twice afterward but stayed on the scene
2124587 he defended his actions on the basis that i had no right to take his picture

2124649 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
2124650 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win

2124672 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2124673 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2124674 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2124675 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
2124676 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
2124677 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
2124678 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
2124679 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
2124680 not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse

2124685 democrat sounds like democracy which is what people signed up for when they came here but the word for republican in chinese sounds a little too close to the word for communist party
2124686 theres uneasiness in the image of a black president particularly among naturalized citizens who have grown up in monocultures
2124687 young asian americans have become dramatically more involved in the 2008 presidential campaign obama can take a lot of credit for that

2124724 i thought of my mother i thought oh my mother is going to hate this i grew up with dogs were dog fanatics in my family but what i love about it and i dont know the whole story about that and im clinging to nothing thats what it seems so i dont know if well find out more about what actually happened im not sure but i love the cheeky fact that shes actually a dog lover shes rescuing the dog dogs are definitely a theme and its kind of a great witty thing on the writers part with all my baggage of cruella de vil and all of that
2124725 im used to beginning middle and end so the idea of not knowing everything at the beginning it can be a challenge and i have great confidence that theyll flag me on things like if theres behavior in episode three that you find out about in episode seven that theyll let me know about that but in some ways its very freeing because you have to just live in the moment which his basically what we do anyway
2124726 the scary thing for me is sometimes not knowing if ive come up or wondering if ive come up with the most interesting thing because it so fast you get very tired at the end of the day too youve done like eight pages and you come to a scene thats just as important as all the other scenes and you just have to keep yourself up part of the exercises that im learning is to keep yourself awake and with it enough to do justice to whats on the page i think that it becomes a physical proposition
2124727 i have always been seduced by really good writing very early on in my career i made the decision to go where the writing was at a time when i was told after doing the world according to garp if i did anything on television it might really affect my career in film it just didnt make sense to me i kept thinking well if the english can do it why cant we do it so thats basically how i have made my choices what i read on the page of course the chance to do it so if i get a wonderful script for a film and i get the same kind of reaction thats what i would do but to have the chance to do a show like this with this incredibly complex character and be and make it in my own backyard was pretty exciting
2124728 ive kind of resigned myself to that fact initially like ted danson said you have a great character and you just play the moment i have intonations and ive been told a little bit about where she comes from and i think its really interesting but i dont know enough about it
2124729 not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
2124730 robert may be further along i dont know what his top end is as a player
2124731 antoine was a little longer but they have a lot of similar characteristics they have the willingness to compete and prepare and learn every time they step on the field they are very focused on technique and very coachable that is another sign of great players
2124732 he was as good as anybody we had on the field today
2124733 on film last year he played harder than anybody we saw you just wondered if he could do that when he got to this level and he can

2124752 la chiesa si occupa di questioni che non la riguardano
2124753 vi prego pi che se riguardasse me stesso che quando vi sembrer conveniente e utile supplichiate umilmente i chierici di venerare sopra ogni cosa il santissimo corpo e sangue del signore nostro ges cristo e i santi nomi e le parole di lui scritte che consacrano il corpo 3 i calici i corporali gli ornamenti dellaltare e tutto ci che serve al sacrificio devono essere preziosi 4 e se in qualche luogo trovassero il santissimo corpo del signore collocato in modo miserevole venga da essi posto e custodito in un luogo prezioso secondo le disposizioni della chiesa e sia portato con grande venerazione e amministrato agli altri con discrezione

2124762 mi dispiace ma lho fatto in ossequio al politically correct
2124763 la chiesa potrebbe investire i suoi soldi nellaiutare veramente il prossimo e non nellintascarsi l8 per mille pure quelli che non gli spettano altra vergogna di cui solo il 10 vengono riutilizzatati in missioni umanitarie
2124764 la chiesa possiede il 25 degli immobili romani alla chiesa non richiesta lici
2124765 dio lo glorifichi con una preghiera una poesia un gesto damore sacrificandosi come fanno i missionari per i 5 miliardi di persone che muoiono di fame per farci fare la bella vita a noi
2124766 i teologi fanno finta di non vedere che grazie alla propria politica in africa laids fa ancora centeinaia di vittime ogni giorno basterebbe dire che non si uccide nessuno usando un preservativo
2124767 nella vita reale essi sono spesso usati in modo errato e incostante
2124768 il massiccio uso del preservativo non riuscito a ridurre gli alti tassi di infezione da hiv
2124769 essi sono invece aumentati fino ad arrivare ad essere tra i pi elevati in africa
2124770 secondo me pu al pi parlare dei suoi metodi come fa abbondantemente ma non pu esprimersi sul creazionismo
2124771 scegli una cosa sola che sia giusta d una cosa sola che sia vera e lascerai sciogliere le lingue di quelli che parlano troppo
2124772 sapere che esiste qualcosa di impenetrabile e conoscere le manifestazioni dellintelletto pi profondo
2124773 nella nostra epoca votata in generale al materialismo gli scienziati sono i soli uomini profondamente religiosi
2124774 risvegliare e mantenere viva questa religiosit fra coloro che hanno la facolt di accoglierla
2124775 quanto a quelli che non vi riceveranno uscendo dalla loro citt scotete la polvere dai vostri piedi in testimonianza contro di loro
2124776 istanbul in fermento contro la visita del papa i lupi grigi assaltano la basilica di s sofia
2124777 sembra ridicolo che lui il papa voglia essere il controllore della scienza
2124778 quanto al controllo della scienza o meglio della tecnologia ovvio che debba esserci
2124779 e la corsa alla conoscenza che e deve restare senza limiti
2124780 non si pu negare che la chiesa nel corso dei secoli non ha certo avallato questi scopi di conoscenza
2124781 che a welby non stato concesso neanche il funerale che per stato concesso a pinochet che magari non si suicidato ma di vite ne ha tolte parecchie
2124782 in merito alla richiesta di esequie ecclesiastiche per il defunto dott piergiorgio welby il vicariato di roma precisa di non aver potuto concedere tali esequie perch a differenza dai casi di suicidio nei quali si presume la mancanza delle condizioni di piena avvertenza e deliberato consenso era nota in quanto ripetutamente e pubblicamente affermata la volont del dott welby di porre fine alla propria vita ci che contrasta con la dottrina cattolica vedi il catechismo della chiesa cattolica nn 2276 2283 2324 2325 non vengono meno per la preghiera della chiesa per leterna salvezza del defunto e la partecipazione al dolore dei congiunti
2124783 a nessuno dovrebbe sfuggire infatti che nel comunicato emesso per informare della decisione il vicariato assicura la preghiera della chiesa per il defunto welby e per la sua famiglia non un particolare trascurabile intere comunit religiose come singoli credenti fecero con intensit e commozione ci che il vicariato enunciava che sacerdoti abbiano celebrato la messa in memoria del povero welby in altre parole non sono mancate la solidariet e la partecipazione al triste evento la chiesa tuttavia ha ritenuto di non dover procedere con i funerali religiosi che hanno unindubbia valenza pubblica perch perch welby nella sua libert drammaticamente provata ha per mesi chiesto e argomentato davanti allopinione pubblica che gli fosse con atto volontario accorciata la vita quella vita che per la chiesa invece dono intangibile di dio dal primo allultimo istante e il funerale cristiano non un raduno di convenienza tra benpensanti ma unazione liturgica che annuncia la verit di dio dio provvidenza damore per ciascuno e quando si dice che lui non fa preferenze di persone si intende dire che ineffabilmente amorevole con ciascuno dentro alla sua propria situazione concreta anche con welby stato cos e anche welby doveva aspettare il suo momento chiss che cosaltro avrebbe capito nel tempo che gli restava che cosa daltro avrebbe offerto e meritato accorciarsi la vita pretendere di disporre della propria morte un atto contro lamore previdente di dio questo la chiesa deve insegnare a tutti quella chiesa che ha sub to impotente i mesi della forsennata predicazione a favore delleutanasia di welby sa bene che ci sono solo in italia decine di migliaia di persone esattamente nella medesima condizione di welby che si deve fare uneutanasia in blocco o non si deve piuttosto insegnare verbo adeguato alla chiesa mater et magistra che i malati devono farsi una ragione del loro stato i medici devono fin dallinizio della malattia assegnare le cure pi idonee comprese quelle che attenuano il dolore le cosiddette cure palliative ancora colpevolmente trascurate dal sistema sanitario i familiari e gli amici devono sorreggere con unassistenza damore il loro congiunto la chiesa questo ha fatto non giudica la persona welby n pu deciderne la condanna o la salvezza eterna prega per lui ma non concede i funerali pubblici in questo modo la chiesa intende proclamare in faccia a menzogne e imposture la verit di dio sulla vita e sulla morte adotta cio un provvedimento damore amaro certamente amaro come negarlo ma lancia un segnale forte lunico che realmente fosse nelle sue disponibilit con dio non si scherza dio va preso sul serio dio ha cura di ogni istante della vita umana e i sacramenti che lei amministra non sono a capriccio ma in riferimento alla verit di chi riceve il sacramento dunque alla sua conversione e sceglie di dirlo pur se questo la mette contro vento o le attira un mucchio di critiche se la chiesa fosse anzitutto preoccupata del consenso e degli applausi si sarebbe comportata diversamente
2124784 la chiesa decide eccome il verso che la ricerca prende in italia non si pu ricercare sulle staminali embrionali il confine tra ricerca e tecnica labile in questo caso
2124785 perch se ponesse limiti alla fisica con la matematica che ci faresti
2124786 che la societ moderna non accetta le unioni omosessuali per colpa della chiesa
2124787 il papa ha studiato una qualche materia che regola le unioni amorose
2124788 a lui chi ha conferito lautorit per giudicare corrette alcune unioni e corrette altre
2124789 che ognuno dovrebbe essere lasciato libero di decidere cosa fare delle sue questioni d amore senza intromissioni dallalto
2124790 io ti dico che nelle mie parole non ci sar un briciolo di verit
2124791 citare uno del 200 mi in linea con la chiesa moderna
2124792 dire quella frase tratta dal catechismo a un induista e quello ti ride in faccia lui non sa cosa sia lo spirito santo
2124793 credete di essere il centro del mondo invece la vostra religione lavete diffusa con le spade ed i fucili
2124794 date retta a me vecchio incredulo che se ne intende il capolavoro della propaganda anti cristiana lessere riusciti a creare nei cristiani nei cattolici soprattutto una cattiva coscienza a instillargli limbarazzo quando non la vergogna per la loro storia a furia di insistere dalla riforma sino ad oggi ce lhanno fatta a convincervi di essere i responsabili di tutti o quasi i mali del mondo vi hanno paralizzati nellautocritica masochistica per neutralizzare la critica di ci che ha preso il vostro posto da tutti vi siete lasciati presentare il conto spesso truccato senza quasi discutere non c problema o errore o sofferenza della storia che non vi siano stati addebitati e voi cos spesso ignoranti del vostro passato avete finito per crederci magari per dar loro man forte invece io agnostico ma storico che cerca di essere oggettivo vi dico che dovete reagire in nome della verit spesso infatti non vero e se talvolta del vero c anche vero che in un bilancio di venti secoli di cristianesimo le luci prevalgono di gran lunga sulle ombre ma poi perch non chiedere a vostra volta il conto a chi lo presenta a voi sono forse stati migliori i risultati di ci che venuto dopo da quali pulpiti ascoltate contriti certe prediche
2124795 gli articoli 843 e 847 mostrano la presunzione di cui parlo
2124796 c da pensare che se luomo non fosse mai andato sulla luna loro ancora dicevano che fosse fatta di materia celeste
2124797 c da pensare che se luomo non fosse mai andato sulla luna loro avrebbero continuato a dire che era fatta di materia celeste
2124798 la chiesa dellepoca di galileo si attenne alla ragione pi che lo stesso galileo e prese in considerazione anche le conseguenze etiche e sociali della dottrina galileiana la sua sentenza contro galileo fu razionale e giusta e solo per motivi di opportunit politica se ne pu legittimare la revisione
2124799 sarebbe assurdo costruire sulla base di queste affermazioni una frettolosa apologetica
2124800 la fede non cresce dal risentimento e dal rifiuto della razionalit
2124801 non condivido le tue idee ma darei la vita per fartele esprimere
2124802 beati voi quando vinsulteranno vi perseguiteranno e mentendo diranno ogni sorta di male contro di voi per causa mia rallegratevi ed esultate perch grande la vostra ricompensa nei cieli cos infatti hanno perseguitato i profeti prima di voi
2124803 ma non tanto il ruolo del papa questo papa che chiaramente contro la scienza
2124804 non si pu negare che la chiesa nel corso dei secoli non ha certo avallato questi scopi
2124805 ma perch la societ moderna ascolta e o obbedisce alla chiesa non me ne ero accorto
2124806 partendo veramente dallintima natura della fede cristiana e al contempo dalla natura del pensiero
2124807 non insisto sulla pericolosit di questo programma dal punto di vista politico e culturale basta pensare alla reazione sollevata nel mondo islamico dallaccenno alla differenza che ci sarebbe tra il dio cristiano e allah differenza attribuita alla supposta razionalit del primo in confronto alla imprevedibile irrazionalit del secondo che sarebbe a sua volta allorigine della mitezza dei cristiani e della violenza degli islamici ci vuole infatti un bel coraggio per sostenere questa tesi nascondendo sotto lo zerbino le crociate i pogrom contro gli ebrei lo sterminio degli indigeni delle americhe la tratta degli schiavi i roghi dellinquisizione e chi ne ha pi ne metta che i cristiani hanno regalato al mondo
2124808 la moderna ragione propria delle scienze naturali conclude infatti il papa con lintrinseco suo elemento platonico porta in s un interrogativo che la trascende insieme con le sue possibilit metodiche essa stessa deve semplicemente accettare la struttura razionale della materia e la corrispondenza tra il nostro spirito e le strutture razionali operanti nella natura come un dato di fatto sul quale si basa il suo percorso metodico ma la domanda sul perch di questo dato di fatto esiste e deve essere affidata dalle scienze naturali ad altri livelli e modi del pensare alla filosofia e alla teologia per la filosofia e in modo diverso per la teologia lascoltare le grandi esperienze e convinzioni delle tradizioni religiose dellumanit specialmente quella della fede cristiana costituisce una fonte di conoscenza rifiutarsi ad essa significherebbe una riduzione inaccettabile del nostro ascoltare e rispondere
2124809 io voglio bene al papa quindi sono contenta che venga
2124810 un cattolico democratico rappresentato per tutti dallesempio di oscar luigi scalfaro nel corso del suo settennato di presidenza della repubblica non si sarebbe mai sognato di dimenticare che dal 20 settembre del 1870 roma non pi la capitale dello stato pontificio mi soffermo piuttosto sullincredibile violazione della tradizionale autonomia delle universit da pi 705 anni incarnata nel mondo da la sapienza dalla sua iniziativa
2124811 sul piano formale prima di tutto anche se nei primi secoli dopo la fondazione delle universit la teologia stata insegnata accanto alle discipline umanistiche filosofiche matematiche e naturali non da ieri che di questa disciplina non c pi traccia nelle universit moderne per lo meno in quelle pubbliche degli stati non confessionali ignoro lo statuto delluniversit di ratisbona dove il professor ratzinger ha tenuto la nota lectio magistralis sulla quale mi soffermer pi avanti ma insisto che di regola essa fa parte esclusivamente degli insegnamenti impartiti nelle istituzioni universitarie religiose i temi che sono stati oggetto degli studi del professor ratzinger non dovrebbero comunque rientrare nellambito degli argomenti di una lezione
2124812 e tanto meno di una lectio magistralis tenuta in una universit della repubblica italiana
2124813 la sua clamorosa violazione nel corso dellinaugurazione dellanno accademico de la sapienza sarebbe stata considerata nel mondo come un salto indietro nel tempo di trecento anni e pi sul piano sostanziale poi le implicazioni sarebbero state ancor pi devastanti consideriamole partendo proprio dal testo della lectio magistralis del professor ratzinger a ratisbona dalla quale presumibilmente non si sarebbe molto discostata quella di roma
2124814 in essa viene spiegato chiaramente che la linea politica del papato di benedetto xvi si fonda sulla tesi che la spartizione delle rispettive sfere di competenza fra fede e conoscenza non vale pi nel profondo
2124815 qui mi interessa per il fatto che da questo incontro tra fede e ragione segue una concezione delle scienze come ambiti parziali di una conoscenza razionale pi vasta e generale alla quale esse dovrebbero essere subordinate la moderna ragione propria delle scienze naturali conclude infatti il papa con lintrinseco suo elemento platonico porta in s un interrogativo che la trascende insieme con le sue possibilit metodiche essa stessa deve semplicemente accettare la struttura razionale della materia e la corrispondenza tra il nostro spirito e le strutture razionali operanti nella natura come un dato di fatto sul quale si basa il suo percorso metodico ma la domanda sui perch di questo dato di fatto esiste e deve essere affidata dalle scienze naturali a altri livelli e modi del pensare alla filosofia e alla teologia per la filosofia e in modo diverso per la teologia lascoltare le grandi esperienze e convinzioni delle tradizioni religiose dellumanit specialmente quella della fede cristiana costituisce una fonte di conoscenza rifiutarsi a essa significherebbe una riduzione inaccetabile del nostro ascoltare e rispondere
2124816 il risultato della sua iniziativa anche nella forma edulcorata della visita del papa con un saluto alla comunit universitaria subito dopo una inaugurazione inevitabilmente clandestina sar comunque che i giornali del giorno dopo titoleranno non si pu pretendere che vadano tanto per il sotttile il papa inaugura lanno accademico delluniversit la sapienza
2124817 questa vicenda mi ha coinvolto e sconvolto nel profondo perch vivo gi ogni giorno per queste vie la sfida di una fede continua coerente e credibile
2124818 io non parlo pacificamente con chi non riconosce i diritti delluomo
2124819 prima dio poi vengo io e cio noi e questo non dimentichiamolo ma
2124820 se il papa fosse stato invitato nellambito di una conferenza o di un dibattito con pi interlocutori non ci sarebbe stata la lettera dei professori
2124821 di ricondurre la scienza sotto la pseudorazionalit dei dogmi della religione
2124822 per la filosofia e in modo diverso per la teologia lascoltare le grandi esperienze e convinzioni delle tradizioni religiose dellumanit specialmente quella della fede cristiana questo specialmente mi sembra proprio la tesi contestabilissima di quella lezione costituisce una fonte di conoscienza rifiutarsi ad essa significherebbe una riduzione inaccettabile del nostro ascoltare e rispondere

2124827 besides even true and living faith in christ precedes regeneration strictly taken and consisting of the mortification or death of the old man and the vivification of the new man for christ becomes ours by faith and we are engrafted into christ are made members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and being thus planted with him we coalesce or are united together that we may draw from him the vivifying power of the holy spirit by which power the old man is mortified and we rise again into a new life

2124831 all the focus has been on the level one merchants the high street and multi national retailers and making sure they are compliant with pci dss
2124832 the smaller retailers handling hundreds of thousands or low millions of transactions are more exposed because they have not been pushed down that path to the same extent there has not been a lot of pressure and enforcement to ensure that they are keeping to the pci dss
2124833 we are as likely to see attacks in the uk as the us or any wealthy western country where there is ample credit cards with a good credit limit
2124834 there is a good chance that there is a lot more insecure technology down among those low level merchants
2124835 and this is the level at which there are going to be a large number of retailers as opposed to the comparatively small number of level one retailers

2124871 you will be going with us tomorrow and im done talking about this
2124872 why should we bother switching to zimbra firstclass already does what we need
2124873 not even a single word is found in the whole scripture about the trinity nor about the persons nor about the essence nor about the substances unity nor the nature of the various divine beings
2124874 i do not separate christ from god more than a voice from the speaker or a beam from the sun christ is the voice of the speaker he and the father are the same thing as the beam and the light are the same light there is therefore a tremendous mystery in the fact that god may be united with man and the man with god it is a surprising wonder that god has taken for himself the body of christ in order to make his special dwelling
2124875 one thousand times the kingdom of christ is called eternal but in the consummation of the times it will be delivered to god this does not mean that the glory of christ will be reduced for that reason as it is its greatest glory to have managed everything until the end and to have submitted everything to the father as it was his will he will deliver the kingdom of god as the superior general hands in to the emperor the palm of the victory in the same manner since all the reason to govern will terminate by that time powers will be abolished the authorities and the administration of the holy spirit will cease since we will not need attorneys or mediators as god will be all in all and then the trinity of dispensations will be over
2124876 since it contains itself the essences of all the things he appears in front of us like fire stone and electricity a rod a flower or any other thing he does not perturb because a stone is seen in god is it a true stone clearly yes god is wood in the wood stone in the stone since he has in himself the being of the stone the form of the stone the substance of the stone
2124877 in the bible there are no mentions to the trinity neither hypostases nor essence nor persons which were made up by the scholastics for the sake of confussion
2124878 the glory that you you gave me i have given it to them so that i am in them like you father are in me
2124879 if he obama moved to the center on abortion a knowledgeable religion journalist remarked to me last week he could win half of evangelicals under 40

2124895 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
2124896 just like the lord of the rings this is a great piece of british literature that we all loved as children and there was a real concern that a group of filmmakers like us may do damage to something so sacred
2124897 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
2124898 it was so important that they saw in the first film that were not
2124899 comic con has been really lovely this year because the first time we were here they were anticipating what the lion the witch and the wardrobe could be but now they know
2124900 andrews done a beautiful job the crew delivered a beautiful film and so going into caspian the fans are along for a great ride
2124901 the children have gone back to narnia 1 300 years later
2124902 they left a beautiful world that they thought they had established and brought a quality to and now they turn up again and its been destroyed the animals have become feral many of them have lost the ability to talk and humankind is suppressing them
2124903 the audience is going to be wonderfully surprised by how much larger and more epic this is going to be
2124904 because the story requires a massive epic nature to bring their quality back into this world andrew is in turn using huge architectural structures massive castles sweeping landscapes and huge armies to generate those images
2124905 i think he might be up there with puss in boots out of shrek
2124906 he will be brilliant and im sure the audience will embrace the good humor of him
2124907 reepicheep is one of the most famous fantasy characters in western literature
2124908 this is a crazy little mouse who stands about a foot tall and runs around with a sword called a rapier its a fencing foil the sort of thing zorro might fight with and he does some serious damage
2124909 hes filled with incredible bravado to the point of madness hes almost suicidal
2124910 harry potter is very different the literature is very complementary of the filmmaking process because in the literature the children grow older one year at a time and that makes for good cinema
2124911 the problem with these films is the children dont grow that much older back in the real world in war torn britain so trying to stay ahead of the maturing of the real actors is a challenge for the filmmakers our progression will rely so heavily on the acting skills of those four actors theyll need to weave a very believable feeling that these children are still sitting at the maturity level of the previous films
2124912 after prince caspian we are going to be so invested in these characters its like recasting gandalf or frodo in lord of the rings
2124913 remember that the two older children dont carry on from caspian into the voyage of the dawn treader but of course the two younger children do
2124914 the one book that i love the horse and his boy im not sure that is an easy story to be brought to the screen
2124915 that relationship between the horse and the boy is so special in literature its one i would love to see
2124916 the one scene i want to see along with the audience is the storming of mirazs castle

2125025 we cannot understand why the pilots have now decided to strike
2125026 this technology has played a very important role in our success
2125027 a very large piece of the overall mobile phone market
2125028 as you know the competition in this market is tough and the average selling prices of mobile phones in the industry have declined so we need to take care of our competitiveness
2125029 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
2125030 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
2125031 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
2125032 the first thing i want to know about it is what the foundations can tell us about the architecture

2125036 susan carnaby does not want other people to suffer as she did through the death of her husband
2125037 only public outcry will change the policy so other people wont be put in danger the documents will show what they did and whether there is some excuse for what they did
2125038 there is no legitimate reason for susan carnabys alleged need to disclose this information to the public public disclosure of the information and documentation produced in this case could affect the ability of the parties to have a fair trial and the ability to seat a fair and impartial jury
2125039 i believe the public has a right to know the details of the investigation especially when the police department is investigating itself
2125040 i am sure my husband would have wanted as many of the actual circumstances as possible regarding his shooting by the houston police as well as the investigation by the houston police to be open and not hidden
2125041 the public information act doesnt apply to case discovery and protective orders and if you look at this in terms of the larger issue the information is relevant to public health and safety
2125042 there are other ways to get a fair trial rather than suppressing government information
2125043 theres a lot of really good people around here i dont want to sit here and let the crime fester
2125044 it all starts with the prostitutes it brings everything else
2125045 now you have right in the heart of coal country the beginning of the solar century
2125046 it couldnt happen at a better time it couldnt be a bigger vote of confidence for pennsylvanias alternative energy policies
2125047 to think that were still sitting on probably 300 to 500 years of coal reserves it just shows that were trying to be innovative
2125048 the legacy of coal was one that when they left they left the scarred landscape behind as well
2125049 it was difficult to get anybody to take a second look at carbon county
2125050 the reality is we are putting the nuts and bolts together on the states entire energy package but that will come to fruition
2125051 just a commitment letter from the governor would suffice for the company to get the proper financing to make this thing work

2125062 when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask where is that marvelous ape
2125063 at one point cindy playfully twirled mccains hair and said youre getting a little thin up there mccains face reddened and he responded at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt mccains excuse was that it had been a long day if elected president of the united states mccain would have many long days
2125064 and noticed that you had a beauty pageant so i encouraged cindy to compete i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
2125065 were not the party of idiotic knee jerk prudery and we look ridiculous when we pretend that we are

2125067 that i want to find clones of justice samuel alito and chief justice john roberts
2125068 we just want to celebrate hillarys accomplishments and what shes done for the country as a whole and women in particular
2125069 sen clinton is going to play a critical role in the convention
2125070 ive said it before and ill say it again hillary is not dead
2125071 then all hill has to do is survive the first ballot at the convention without him being nominated and then its sic wide open
2125072 nature abhors a vacuum but whats that between your ears
2125073 any accusations that my clients participated in or hosted a party for mason high school students where alcohol was served are absolutely untrue
2125074 the accusation that my clients held a party in their home where alcohol was consumed by minors with their prior knowledge are absolutely false
2125075 mrs crotty was out of state on the date apparently in question i caution you that my clients are not public figures and that they will undoubtedly incur damage to their reputation in the community by the reckless reporting of unsubstantiated accusations

2125085 were at the point where were saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years theyll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2125086 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2125087 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2125088 its deemed more acceptable than in the city because the valleys the alternative scene and always has been
2125089 when certain people drink it brings out more of a violent tendency often leading to problems
2125090 young men especially can become aggressive on alcohol and get involved in fights and assaults
2125091 the really common things that we see at the royal brisbane and womens hospital are head injuries where theyve fallen over and hit their heads and we see lots of people with broken hands after hitting people
2125092 it really is very frustrating from a medical perspective because it chews up our resources if people didnt drink we wouldnt see anywhere near as many patients as we do
2125093 the big thing a lot of us feel is that one of the most dangerous and insidious things about e ecstasy is that most young people think its not hurting them but every time they use it its hurting them a little
2125094 we deal with them all the time these kids who are now 30 or 40 who are suffering serious mental health problems as a result of their drug use in their 20s often it ends in suicide
2125095 weve never had a year like this its the worst
2125096 the tomato plants sat there for a month in cold wet soil they didnt die they just didnt advance
2125097 they go into defense mode and slow down when temperatures go above 90 degrees
2125098 you can also have lighter and darker spots on the same fruit theyre fine thats just a heat response
2125099 tomatoes were in demand people were asking for them and they just werent available
2125100 we had a whole week of rain heavy rain and a very cold wind
2125101 come to think of it i guess were lucky we had tomatoes at all
2125102 when frost comes thats it no matter when we started picking we dont get a break
2125103 we have a lot of green ones but we do have some red ones
2125104 we had one tiny tomato and he picked it when it was almost completely green
2125105 last week we had 7804 unique relistings this week its 6572
2125106 some of these will have sold others withdrawn from sale
2125107 its different than the gold coast we dont have a real lot of quality stock
2125108 interest rates dont seem to worry our buyers its more the stockmarket
2125109 people always want to live in the inner city and it is a market which performs well over time
2125110 you would be a better person if you followed these food fads

2125115 this funding is required and been requested to increase and enhance the isr intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in centcom
2125116 because people were stuck in old ways of doing business its been like pulling teeth
2125117 will assist our efforts to grow the uav capability in such platforms as shadow predator reaper raven and hunter
2125118 it will allow us to buy additional scaneagle detachments funding contractors to be able to have additional orbits of various platforms infrastructure improvements to be able to operate some of these things
2125119 some of these attacks are well planned and well executed
2125120 huge benefit in terms of convenience efficiency and cost saving
2125121 i enjoy her writing and this blog has the best header i have ever seen
2125122 looking at it from a different perspective this time not as a player but someone now involved in coaching and player development i can see the challenges it presents
2125123 were going to have to develop players differently training them differently if we want them to be as flexible as the game will demand them to be in following generations
2125124 ive been a believer for a long time that coach is the wrong word its much bigger than that its a management role youre overseeing a big enterprise a cricket team these days is big business
2125125 increasingly players are going from one part of the world to another in quick time for short periods having to adapt to different wicket conditions different weather conditions different rules for different formats
2125126 players will have to make decisions themselves to take a break from time to time otherwise theyll burn out very quickly
2125127 in some ways careers are being elongated with more money and more opportunities but in other ways careers will be shortened because bowlers in particular will have less time to recover from injuries
2125128 rehab is going to be very important and the mental health of these guys is going to be critical to their success if franchises are going to pay huge money for these guys in the ipl then they have to look after them
2125129 twenty20 cricket is here to stay and that will place more pressure on the administration of the game than ever before
2125130 there was a lot of turmoil certainly but there were a lot of challenges a lot of new thinking that came into the game both on and off the field
2125131 it challenged me to reach levels that i hadnt perhaps considered before i had to use more of my skills on reflection i felt i was probably using only about 80 per cent of my ability physical and mental up to that point
2125132 it was the greatest challenge i ever faced as a player
2125133 it was not only dangerous but emotionally draining it was tough to score and it took a long time
2125134 with 12 overs an hour you got 6 1 2 delivered in their half of the pitch so that basically left you with three overs an hour 18 balls to try to score from
2125135 everything that came out of his hand came down from a steep angle and it looked short
2125136 i found myself playing back to balls that hit me in the foot there was a huge adjustment
2125137 there are a lot of new things that will happen in cricket
2125138 india is such a big part of cricket and there are indians all over the world
2125139 i think twenty20 cricket offers the opportunity for the game to expand in ways that has been hard to do in the past
2125140 this short version of the game is an ideal tool to take into non traditional areas to expand the game and to challenge other sports such as soccer in ways that they havent been challenged before
2125141 the olympics would be another opportunity and another avenue and is something that should be pursued
2125142 cosa vuoi che sia passa tutto quanto solo un p di tempo e ci riderai su
2125143 we found out that armed action will not get the united states out of iraq
2125144 after five years of directing painful blows to them they did not budge from a single meter in the country
2125145 it allows us to test various theories about how the universe is
2125146 by looking for new type of particles that have yet to be discovered one may hope to get insight into whether some of the very interesting ideas in particle physics are correct or not
2125147 models that attempt to unify gravity with the other forces often make predictions that there should be other particles present in the universe that have yet to be discovered if we can go out and discover those particles that are predicted but have yet to be found that could powerfully give us an indication were on the right track or alternatively tell us no were on the wrong track and we should look somewhere else
2125148 theyre looking down deeper and deeper into what may be the most fundamental particles of the universe
2125149 we know were not there yet we know protons are made up of other small things the idea is to find out about those small things
2125150 the debris of those collisions only lasts for a very short amount of time so they have to have extremely sophisticated detectors to take a look at these things a fraction of a fraction of a second
2125151 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2125152 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2125153 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2125154 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2125155 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2125156 all the family opposed the idea that he train as a hurdler
2125157 i told his father two things first that i could train lui to be a very good athlete and second that i would educate him to be a useful person for the society
2125158 he is my son and he will go with coach sun
2125159 he rushed to the hospital immediately after getting off the train
2125160 he gently propped up his grandmother tenderly hung the gold medal around her neck and held it so that the medal would not become too heavy
2125161 we were on the same plane and yao ming said now you can finally understand the pressure i am feeling
2125162 he is a sports star but the reason i love him and my girlfriends love him is that he has traditional manners he respects his parents and he always says the most important thing is self discipline
2125163 this is not like other athletes he is very nice and he never says no to people
2125164 the audience was very hot very enthusiastic and i felt what the atmosphere will be like at the olympic games i am prepared for it i am ready
2125165 my situation has changed and i have money now but i cant shop
2125166 four years ago i was not so popular and the people did not recognise me when i was on the street but now everyone recognises me so i cant be on the street very often in my heart i would like to feel ordinary and it is hard to feel like this
2125167 i look up to him and watch videos of him and try to copy the technique and get the training drills
2125168 he basically had his leg over his head i think ill have to work on that
2125169 he doesnt have as much speed over the 100m flat as some of those other guys so that means he doesnt run into the hurdles he has the perfect amount of speed to get the rhythm right
2125170 i am trying my best so it is ok if i can win or i cannot
2125171 i am the best psychologist for myself the best mental teacher the best way is to not think of yourself as so important and to pay attention to the job you have to do
2125172 i will try my best to seize this chance but i have to live even after this so i think i have already done very well
2125173 he went there not to compete but to do commercials for visa but he likes to be at home because outside china there are problems for him with food environment
2125174 i go home and i go to the training place in shanghai and these two places are the most safe places for me
2125175 a lot of times i think he is just a young man he has many things he wants to do but he cant that is why i ask our team members to do whatever we can to make him happy because many times he is alone in the room on the computer on the internet chat
2125176 he feels very happy when he sings and he sings really well and he likes japanese food so we try to get that for him
2125177 it is really difficult but i appreciate so much his ability to target and focus on the olympic games for this he is sacrificing a lot of his own wants
2125178 everybody expects liu should get a gold medal and that is a big problem
2125179 i have been trying to talk to the chinese media saying that nobody can guarantee a gold medal liu xiang is strong but his rivals are strong as well
2125180 neither of us will show mercy at the olympics so lets wait and see what happens then
2125181 i cant see a seasoned performer like him losing a sense of what he needs to do
2125182 he should be thriving at the moment he obviously doesnt lack in self belief that counts for a lot
2125183 only in hindsight can one understand what he will be going through the only way is to manage it to his advantage
2125184 no i can see it its just over the next
2125185 texas all of a sudden has almost 10 percent of the representation in the united states senate
2125186 well im not sure we want any more representation in the united states senate from time to time we look at washington and we just kind of shake our head and say you know if yall would just leave us alone
2125187 if they dont have that eagle project finished by then that you run into some problems they get overcome by the fumes the car fumes and the perfume and they get real distracted
2125188 texas is a red state not in play at all
2125189 for those four supreme court justices to try to overlawyer that is beyond me i dont understand how individuals like that can sleep at night
2125190 we must defend our border i wish we could see better cooperation with them mexico but its also not their responsibility for congress to get off their coondogs and do something
2125191 if yoda ever turned that way sidious himself would be annihilated the universe had yet to comprehend the kind of evil that a jedi knight of nearly nine hundred years could wield
2125192 we rest on the thee my shield and my defender
2125193 im old im fat im bald im ugly i have a plate in my head
2125194 my face was crushed by a bowling ball going 90 mph
2125195 you know how you love the power rangers well lets say you had a chance to be a power ranger but you had to move to china to do it wouldnt you want to move to china and be a power ranger
2125196 when the war began we were promised that iraqi oil revenue would pay for most of the reconstruction costs of the country five years later the american people are still footing the bill
2125197 senator cornyn believes the iraqis should pay for as much of the reconstruction effort as possible
2125198 linkreincarnate i dont think taking pictures would happen but think that it scanning some sort of identifier on the object woul blatently happen i e barcode
2125199 call me a hipster as long as you a listener
2125200 all the while make my words important so if i slip away if i die today the last thing you remember wont be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur

2125204 a lot of people are refusing because they either are in affordable housing or want to stay in the community theyre in
2125205 if they sell they really cant afford to buy another house of the same quality
2125206 id be very concerned to see houses in these areas like rocklea raised above the flood level of brisbane river because youd have to raise it about 2m to 3m and the risk of being isolated in an emergency is too great for that to happen
2125207 we are doing all that we can to help people in flood prone areas
2125208 i think that when longtime texas oil executive t boone pickens comes on television and says this is one problem we cant drill our way out of im not sure hes right on that
2125209 but i understand his point i will say this is one problem that we cant get out of without drilling and then we need to expand every other source of energy as well
2125210 i do not think we will ever see gas prices down in the 2 or 2 50 a gallon range again
2125211 i wouldnt want to have the moratorium lifted in a way that didnt give somebody preferably the state of north carolina the ability to identify and protect particularly sensitive areas and im very strongly convinced that the north carolina outer banks would be one such area
2125212 she is uncommonly well educated duke oxford harvard a former federal trade commissioner secretary of transportation secretary of labor and president of the red cross
2125213 and like mccain she was a candidate for the 2000 presidential nomination born in 1936 dole is too old to run in 2016 but is manifestly qualified to jump into the oval office if need be and land on her feet she is up for re election to the senate this year but north carolina can let her run for both jobs
2125214 in him we have the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of gods grace
2125215 it shouldnt be bad news that people are doing less driving but thats what our funding depends on
2125216 this helps shine a bright light on how important it is that we address new ways of finding transportation money
2125217 a dollar of revenue today buys about half of what it did back in 2002
2125218 our revenues are declining and our construction costs are up
2125219 over the long term no doubt we wont be able to do as much repaving work or as much new construction work it will have an impact
2125220 this will put a challenge on whoever the incoming governor is to show some leadership for the state in dealing with the transportation infrastructure
2125221 nous avons des chars russes sur notre territoire et des avions au dessus de notre territoire en pleine lumi re

2125233 weve read about you in our newspaper und about the very fine lodge in which you live
2125234 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2125235 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
2125236 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
2125237 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that but i dont think that that inflating tires is a way to become energy independent
2125238 and im sorry to tell you that the price of oil as far as i can tell is not gonna go down anytime soon until we eliminate our dependency on it we can do that as a nation we can turn out the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
2125239 they started to sprint and i was cramping but i could feel myself gaining on them so i just waited waited and waited
2125240 in the final 50 meters i decided to start to come around holloway had the right side open at the line so i just dove in there as fast as i could before he closed it and i had a really good bike throw at the end
2125241 im grateful my team has put me in a lot of the big races and a lot of the big criterium series
2125242 so ive just been trying to learn and today i got my shot i was the go to guy and i just used it to my advantage
2125243 at the end today austin was keeping me out of trouble and riding toward the front so i decided to just follow him
2125244 uh you ran away i was going to ask you to dance
2125245 intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
2125246 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2125247 she couldnt tell me that i wanted to give her a balloon but she didnt want that she only wants her mommy she said and she said that these people took her from her mommy
2125248 on monday july 28 i received a call from the office of speaker tom craddick
2125249 in response to this my counterpart in the democratic party state chair boyd richie is now proclaiming that the speaker is using unethical tactics by using his office and staff to strong arm libertarians off the ballot
2125250 to suggest that these dealings are shady is easily refuted by their openness
2125251 boyd richie should understand that unlike his party libertarians remain committed to the principles of individual liberty and social tolerance
2125252 it has become more clear that the democratic party does not offer any commitment to the principles of individual liberty and social tolerance that the voters expect
2125253 it is my hope that the voters will make their decision on these important issues and have choices on the ballot that represent their sincere interests instead of partisan hyperbole let us also hope that regardless of the outcome in november respectful and constructive dialogue is welcome and common ground can be sought

2125267 you see a woman just really digging deep into her soul and bearing pain and being on top of it
2125268 i saw a strength come out of her id never seen before
2125269 weve gone through something now that were like i know and you know and only you and i know and thats good for us
2125270 growing up mcconaugheys father wouldnt even respond to such claims as
2125271 never c a n t nasty word in our family and that will be a nasty word to levi
2125272 if thats a major burden if something like oh ive got famous parents and i cant get out of their shadow if that kind of thing were to happen i got a little road trip well take to africa that will sober things right up for him
2125273 no were living a little higher than that a little better than that hes got us we love him
2125274 every one of the messages in hair is equally resonant today as in 1967
2125275 is about the environmental movement its about the antiwar movement its about the gay liberation movement its about the feminist movement the black power movement
2125276 its all of these ideas that came out of a piece of history when there was huge possibility and huge potential
2125277 theyre taking concepts and much like the ziegfeld follies setting them in a revue type of situation with a narrative drawn through that isnt as clear as it would be in say oklahoma or gypsy
2125278 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2125279 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts

2125281 please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together
2125282 this one i think is going to be bigger and more spectacular not necessarily more surprising but more impressive i think than any previous ceremony
2125283 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2125284 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2125285 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2125286 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2125287 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2125288 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2125289 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2125290 shes proving now in the freedom and prosperity of a spectacularly attractive late middle age that she can do effortless as well as strenuous ensemble as well as star enjoy rather than hide behind her talent
2125291 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2125292 he is 16 years old lives locally travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street
2125293 he will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items cash and jewellery
2125294 because of the children and young persons act 1989 police cannot show you a picture of the 16 year old burglar operating in your neighbourhood

2125297 without giving away the figures resellers can make around 40 per cent margins on a laptop bag
2125298 nobody carries around a naked laptop any more so there is going to be a sale with every machine that goes out
2125299 removable back up devices need a home and external hard drives are proving incredibly popular
2125300 when i was a pc builder i would have bitten someones hand off if they had offered the sort of markups you can make on a bag a stylish bag is a safe bet
2125301 a case is like a second skin for a laptop it enables them to work on the move but if they drop the system they do not smash it
2125302 a typical salesmans laptop takes a battering so we can offer them protection and extend the life of a machine
2125303 we will take this as far as possible through resellers
2125304 leading indicators for an above normal season during 2008 include the continuing multi decadal signal atmospheric and oceanic conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 and the lingering effects of la ni a
2125305 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2125306 it is critical that everyone know the risk for your area and have a plan to protect yourself your family and your property or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season
2125307 even people who live inland should be prepared for severe weather and flooding from a tropical storm or a hurricane
2125308 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
2125309 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
2125310 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
2125311 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building
2125312 basically youll get in a wireless system a similar experience as in your office or your home
2125313 in europe this may not happen before 2015 though in some countries it could be earlier
2125314 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
2125315 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
2125316 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
2125317 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
2125318 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving
2125319 if the cycle is paused because the cell is having some problem
2125320 it cant stop and go back so it either kills the new cell or repairs the problem
2125321 if either the replicating enzymes run into damage or if there are insufficient precursors for making dna then this checkpoint response will be activated
2125322 there are two aspects to this response one is to prevent the cycle from proceeding and the other is to prepare the cell to deal with the damage
2125323 so now you have cells in the s phase which dont typically express these genes expressing them
2125324 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
2125325 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
2125326 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
2125327 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
2125328 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
2125329 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
2125330 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
2125331 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others
2125332 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
2125333 when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
2125334 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details
2125335 we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
2125336 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
2125337 when we decide to look at an object we clearly perceive it as being significant and reallocate our memory to it
2125338 so even though we havent looked at it yet we still remember more about it than the object weve just looked at
2125339 part of the reason these patients may not be aware of objects is because they have very severe limitations in their visual working memory capacity
2125340 without memory devoted to some parts of the visual field patients dont see objects there
2125341 we sell a lot to home users but we think that people have tended to see us as a corporate product
2125342 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2125343 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2125344 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2125345 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual
2125346 l eaders and employees demonstrate little trust and confidence in others

2125354 everyone knows that we have a different much more emphatic view of love between the sexes than the ancient greeks and the orientals and that the modern view of love is an extension of the spirit of christianity in however attenuated and secularized a form but the cult of love is not as rougemont claims a christian heresy christianity is from its inception paul the romantic religion the cult of love in the west is an aspect of the cult of suffering suffering as the supreme token of seriousness the paradigm of the cross we do not find among the ancient hebrews greeks and the orientals the same value placed on love because we do not find there the same positive value placed on suffering suffering was not the hallmark of seriousness rather seriousness was measured by ones ability to evade or transcend the penalty the suffering by ones ability to achieve tranquility and equilibrium in contrast the sensibility we have inherited identifies spirituality and seriousness with turbulence suffering passion for two thousand years among christians and jews it has been spiritually fashionable to be in pain this is not love which we overvalue but suffering more precisely the spiritual merits and benefits of suffering the modern contribution to this christian sensibility has been to discover the making of works of art and the venture of sexual love as the two most exquisite sources of suffering it is this that we look for in a writers diary and which pavese provides in disquieting abundance
2125355 we do not find among the ancient hebrews greeks and the orientals the same value placed on love because we do not find there the same positive value placed on suffering
2125356 yes i feel homophobia was the driving force behind the reaction of the three parents that opted to pull their children from the play at the eleventh hour and also the impetus for the principal to cancel the play the same day she received the emails from the parents
2125357 speaking from the standpoint of someone who has dealt with close minded power hungry homophobic and pitifully out of touch school administrators first hand i am convinced that our public school system is on a very dark path
2125358 ive been a devoted drama teacher for six years now often donating my time and resources to the children and the school with whom i worked not begrudging a second of it but loving every moment i spent writing directing searching for costumes painting sets gathering props
2125359 ive fought the good fight over and over have stuck it to the man several times and after all that when no change has been effected i feel i have to move on from the district ive given eight years to in order to preserve my sanity
2125360 no one advocates for you but you if youre exceptionally lucky you have parents who are willing to go to bat for you but they cant attend the investigatory meetings youre forced to endure if you fail to salute
2125361 i want to teach on my terms and be a creative force in the lives of my students im not cut out for pandering to test scores and cow towing to the illogical self centered and destructive whims of incompetent and narcissistic administrators im resigning from my position in my district effective monday i hope to find a place where creativity open mindedness and the best interest of the student are prized above pettiness ass covering and out of control egos i think at some point the students will revolt if my situation and wades is any indicator the students will not go quietly into the night as admin continue to create a learning environment that is stifling and patronizing to them they are much too savvy and sophisticated to tolerate these conditions for long they are educations greatest hope for change
2125362 i honestly believe it was only a small handful of parents that objected to the nature of the content three out of a cast of 52
2125363 unfortunately the principal assumed that was how the entire community would react
2125364 however as painful as it was im not at all sorry it happened the way it did
2125365 where do i go from here good question i want to write direct work with kids i absolutely do not plan to return to conventional classroom academic teaching being a drama teacher in a creative open minded environment would be ideal writing on the side all the while i dont feel my employability has been impacted in a negative way necessarily if a certain district declines to hire me based on what they know of the situation then its for the best i dont belong with people like that anyway

2125372 we now offer categories for all members of the filmmaking community from shorts to features student films and documentaries to animation and screenplays every year the quality of submissions we receive just gets better and we dont expect this year to be any different
2125373 in addition to our show at the seacoast science center thursday aug 7 johnny wad and the cash are playing host to mark hummels blues harmonica blowout on aug 14 at the rough on route one in york featured players in addition to mark hummel will be magic dick of the j geils band kenny neal a former wc handy best album award winner and rusty zinn accomplished blues guitarist and a nominee for the 2007 international reggae artist of the year show starts at 6 p m if you are a fan of the blues and blues harmonica this should be a great show
2125374 phil said david was interested in seeing something done with in my own words this zeitgeist play which was uncannily prescient about the situation we now find ourselves in in iraq and i get the play and read it and im blown away because hes absolutely right
2125375 so it was a top flight production but somehow or other it has been lost to history
2125376 he wants to have it done by november so we can immediately find a way to get it produced
2125377 i spend a lot of time teaching writing doesnt take the back seat but i like to have them share my energy
2125378 i wouldnt want to take my energy away from the kids for the poetry
2125379 ill still write poems but ive always been profoundly moved by elephants my plan is to get near them sri lanka or something
2125380 then ill do some nonfiction writing and hopefully make money to give to these places
2125381 i dont really have the money but no one else was going to do it and they needed it to get it off the ground
2125382 its the kind of thing ive talked about for a while helping the kids with their art so it was an opportunity
2125383 i think ill be back at it at some point soon
2125384 big big big news for now all i can tell you is this phantasmagoria history of a haunted city is in the pre production stage
2125385 with a focus on portsmouths haunted history and a unique and often overlooked past
2125386 that would be the extremely generous jim white thank god hes talented

2125390 we are trying to find allies for our position especially among new member states its possible to form a blocking minority and we are working on this
2125391 the french eu presidency will try to close this topic so we need to be even more active in defending our cause which is economic development
2125392 the negotiations are ongoing we cant allow a situation in which we are forced to limit co2 emissions without being able to invest in our own energy security

2125395 i have a sense of humour like a brit so i thought people would appreciate that noel gallagher was one of the biggest detractors so i figured that was a cool way to start the show
2125396 ive totally lost hope that change will come through mass protests
2125397 its difficult to organise protests now because most of the leaders are in jail or in hiding

2125406 the executives weve been talking to over the past 12 months want to lead well they want to be inspirational leaders but they just cant do it they face more personal pressure and frustration than at any other time in their leadership career
2125407 how do i minimise time in plate spinning without it being my full time job
2125408 how do you create the space to stop the daily fire fight to do leadership my business development is dying
2125409 frustration leads to inaction which adds to how overwhelmed they feel which increases their frustration
2125410 im willing to fight the supertanker it may take many kilometers to make the rudder turn but i want to know how to win support and credibility for the fight
2125411 how do i maintain the right balance between being dissatisfied with the status quo and being perceived as too critical or negative
2125412 while managers may know what to do to lead their people enthuse their staff use emotional intelligence and have the speed of trust for example many managers still dont know how to lead as well as they could
2125413 business managers must rise to the challenge and accept the responsibility to lead they can be good leaders even in these difficult times but this in turn depends on the availability of serious professional leadership training and coaching that deals with the critical interpersonal skills of overcoming resistance and building support
2125414 you put yourself in a position of danger and therefore were responsible for actions taken against you

2125421 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2125422 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2125423 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2125424 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2125425 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2125426 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2125427 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in
2125428 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee

2125430 i think she was making a strong case for the community up until that point
2125431 any time a candidate goes to such extremes to make a case that is purely negative and a very personal and unfounded attack its going to backfire
2125432 do you ever wonder how you think if you do this book will fascinate and inform you if you dont you will after reading this book either way youll enjoy learning how we dont usually do it as we think we do how we may do it better for that very reason and how we may do it still better once we understand

2125446 dana schutzs work has been described as teetering on the edge of tradition and innovation my paintings are loosely based on metanarratives the pictures float in and out of pictorial genres still lifes become personified portraits become events and landscapes become constructions i embrace the area between which the subject is composed and decomposing formed and formless inanimate and alive reformers 2004 recently i have been making paintings of sculptural goddesses transitory still lifes people who make things people who are made and people who have the ability to eat themselves although the paintings themselves are not specifically narrative i often invent imaginative systems and situations to generate information these situations usually delineate a site where making is a necessity audiences potentially dont exist objects transcend their function and reality is malleable
2125447 shortly after new york based artist dana schutz graduated from columbia universitys prestigious mfa program in 2002 she wowed critics and collectors with her first solo show frank from observation at new yorks lfl gallery since then major institutions including the museum of modern art the guggenheim museum and the whitney museum of american art have added her colorful innovative works to their collections fresh from her second solo outing at contemporary fine arts in berlin schutz spoke to artkrush editor paul laster about her work and a painters lifestyle
2125448 they are not involved in any way in this conflict between the russian military and the georgian military
2125449 we have upwards of 100 military trainers who are in georgia now weve been able to account for all of them
2125450 we have forces in georgia so obviously the secretary is interested in the situation there
2125451 what they do in a situation like this is contact the embassy contact our troops there assess the situation and begin to receive any information or request for support from the embassy or any reports about us citizens being in danger
2125452 at this point we are early in the hostilities the situation is sort of dynamic at this point
2125453 we are looking at the situation and how it develops its still early
2125454 it takes a lot of years to see what you love when you let go then you see what makes you happy you can figure out what the hell you are
2125455 i think this is close to what i wanted to do its very sustainable in the right place the right length and i like it

2125457 last august i was as a fresh as a daisy this year i decided to direct right about now im melted down to just about zero and the season is just starting
2125458 i have minor concerns about holding up not fresh as a daisy this time
2125459 i was hoping to reunite wonderful actors from theatre by the sea but the concept was broad we could do art exhibitions concerts it was an artist collaborative

2125461 folks called and said we have a mailing but no theater
2125462 i did learn so much its one of those cases of what doesnt kill me makes me stronger it was an interesting time
2125463 you have to follow your bliss mine had always been intimate theater rather than big proscenium theater
2125464 i didnt know how i was going to do it because didnt have a theater but i wanted to do intimate theater
2125465 i love that theater its so intimate so inviting you can really make magic happen there it would be small enough that it wouldnt be exhausting like hampton had been and i wouldnt lose so much money anyway i though it was 47 seats instead of 700 so it was worth a try
2125466 my box office was a computer and a file box and cell phone and it all fit in a canvas bag
2125467 ive decided im not as deep philosophically as i would have always wished im not my conclusion is im a popularist i like pieces that make me laugh all the way through and give me a big lump in my throat and maybe tears at the end because ive learned and experienced something about life that makes my life better or fuller and thats what i love to do im not avant garde or cutting edge thats just not me

2125469 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
2125470 but it owns us the music doesnt even belong to us anymore it belongs to the people into whose lives its woven the only way to get our lives back is to slay this thing
2125471 everything must come to an end at some point and this is a happy ending for us
2125472 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
2125473 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issue of paper

2125485 we are aware of a letter from the ec to the uk government regarding the governments implementation of eu directives on data privacy any such letter is a matter between the commission and the eu member state
2125486 however we are in active dialogue with the european commission and the uk government we will continue to work with legislators and regulators to ensure that our legally compliant system is deployed in a way that exceeds current internet advertising industry standards for privacy online

2125500 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
2125501 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
2125502 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
2125503 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
2125504 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents
2125505 money saved from this decision will not be cut from lgbt related projects but is being re invested to help facilitate a pan london campaign against homophobic bullying in schools a cause i am sure you will agree it is vitally important to support
2125506 pride london includes a substantial presence in the soho area just six weeks prior to your event and we feel that there is also an element of duplication between both events
2125507 the withdrawal of funding for the event could prove fatal and mean 2008 could be soho prides last year on the streets of london
2125508 soho is very much a village within a city with the community spirit easy to spot as everyone clubs together to create such a great day out
2125509 whether youre watching the cabaret dancing to your favourite tunes relaxing in the square or just indulging in a spot of drinking with your friends youre guaranteed a great day out
2125510 which have a very significant focus in soho thus also having an impact on local businesses including gay owned ones
2125511 in this case the priority has to be trying to tackle the terrible potentially tragic consequences of homophobic bullying over a commercially led matter
2125512 what we will continue to do is ensure that the pride celebrations can thrive and that london remains at the forefront of gay issues
2125513 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2125514 we also wanted to know about the history of the neanderthals themselves
2125515 most argue there were a few thousand neanderthals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
2125516 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neanderthals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
2125517 this is a good sign for the possible replacement of the other three genes used to reprogram cells
2125518 ips cells hold great potential for future medicine but we must learn how to generate these cells in a manner that is safe for clinical therapies
2125519 this advance in reprogramming is one key step toward that goal
2125520 were not sure if the wnt molecule is doing the same thing as c myc or complementing activity
2125521 but it does increase stem cell growth similar to c myc
2125522 this is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
2125523 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
2125524 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells
2125525 we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate
2125526 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2125527 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2125528 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2125529 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2125530 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2125531 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2125532 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2125533 tells us that we really cant assume that measurements create reality because it is possible to erase the effects of a measurement and start again
2125534 this is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice these new behaviors in a virtual environment and in real life
2125535 its also a great place to meet other avatars and share information and experiences
2125536 we hope to develop multi national collaborations in sl to increase awareness knowledge skills and support for healthy living
2125537 reducing obesity is an international priority and sl provides a portal to an international community
2125538 the two sestrin genes appear to be the missing piece of the puzzle that explains how p53 can inhibit the mtor pathway and thereby negatively regulate cell growth
2125539 we have now shown that in addition to controlling ros accumulation sestrins and p53 also inhibit cell growth by inhibiting the activity of mtor this explains how p53 functions as a potent regulator of so many aspects of cell physiology and provides protection against dna damage and stress
2125540 this coming monday august 11 it will be held at sri international 333 ravenswood ave menlo park ca it starts at 6 pm with a buffet dinner
2125541 this panel of both early and later stage startup founders and executives from a range of sectors including green tech enterprise software mobile semiconductors and web 2 0 will talk about ideas money technology marketing and sales talent and timing what factors are most responsible for economic success what are the biggest obstacles they are overcoming and how are they doing it what advice do they have for tomorrows entrepreneurs
2125542 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2125543 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2125544 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2125545 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2125546 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2125547 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2125548 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2125549 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
2125550 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
2125551 no nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health different saddle designs may require some re learning of how to ride a bicycle but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self evident
2125552 the a b cs of the journal of sexual medicine awareness bicycle seats and choices
2125553 for the first time we have a prospective study of healthy policemen riding bikes on the job using wider no nose bike saddles for 6 months not only did their sensation improve their erectile function also improved changing saddles changed physiology this is a landmark study for our field that that is important for future riders and modification of lifestyle showing improvement without any active treatment
2125554 if we can understand how different sexual systems in plants have evolved we can then begin to understand how sex in general evolves
2125555 humans and other mammals generally have only two sexes males and females
2125556 but other species including plants can evolve bewildering arrays of sexual combinations
2125557 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
2125558 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
2125559 this is the first report of racial and ethnic differences in fgf 23 levels and we are now investigating whether such differences are also seen in healthy patients and those with earlier stages of kidney disease
2125560 we expect those differences may relate to previous observations of calcium phosphorous and vitamin d metabolism differences among racial groups we also need to investigate whether fgf 23 elevations are toxic in themselves or if they are simply a biomarker for abnormal phosphate balance
2125561 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage kidney disease who do not yet require dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
2125562 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group
2125563 some heart failure patients spend a lot of time in and out of the hospital due to chest pain and trouble breathing
2125564 at any time such as when the subject is beginning to feel poorly we immediately get readings of pulmonary pressure we are hopeful we can avoid a hospitalization by adjusting the subjects medication based on the pressure recording as we evaluate the cardiomems wireless pressure monitoring system we see great potential to increase convenience to patients and hospital efficiency by cutting back on frequent trips to the emergency room
2125565 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2125566 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2125567 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2125568 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2125569 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction

2125574 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2125575 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2125576 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2125577 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2125578 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2125579 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school

2125581 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for the next hour im decompressing im getting re engaged into what its like to be a civilian
2125582 if we can have an effect there where we can take people out thats a real plus in terms of saving american lives
2125583 our folks look at it as theyre in the fight theyre saving lives they dont feel too bad about that

2125590 every measure has been taken to stage safe and secure games
2125591 but the ioc is always insistent that the need to ensure security not hinder the festive spirit essential to the games success

2125619 these downloads are clearly being used as malware conduits but all it takes is for one company staffer to be taken in by the forged email alerts and a companys security can be totally undone
2125620 the issue the anti virus and malware security industry faces with these types of downloads is that the hackers are using code obfuscation techniques to hide what the program code actually does
2125621 coupled with shape shifting technology that changes the pattern of the program each time it is downloaded this makes it difficult if not impossible for regular it security software to spot the code as it reaches the desktop pc
2125622 the industry needs to stay one step ahead of the hackers in this regard and respond with new approaches when dealing with developing trends like this one
2125623 behavioural analysis technology can spot any unusual activity triggered by an inappropriate download like this one and the code execution stopped within a few processor cycles it can act as the security safety net that any modern firm now needs
2125624 the guardian a traditional childhood pastime could provide a breakthrough in renewable energy after successful experiments in flying a giant kite at one of europes top research centres scientists from delft university of technology in the netherlands harnessed energy from the wind by flying a 10 sq metre kite tethered to a generator producing 10 kilowatts of power the experiment generated enough electricity to power 10 family homes and the researchers have plans to test a 50kw version of their invention called laddermill eventually building up to a proposed version with multiple kites that they claim could generate 100 megawatts enough for 100 000 homes

2125657 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
2125658 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2125659 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
2125660 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
2125661 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
2125662 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle

2125664 these data add a new twist to the association and suggest that periodontal disease may be there before diabetes
2125665 we found that over two decades of follow up individuals who had periodontal disease were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life when compared to individuals without periodontal disease
2125666 this could be suggestive that the people who lost all of their teeth had a history of infection at some point but subsequently lost their teeth and removed the source of infection
2125667 this is particularly interesting as it supports previous research originating from the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study invest which has shown that individuals lacking teeth are at intermediate risk for cardiovascular disease
2125668 wimax is the cheapest channel to do this and it is the channel that can deliver the best quality of service

2125670 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2125671 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2125672 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
2125673 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
2125674 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
2125675 future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period if found to be effective such interventions may prevent the devastating impact associated with postpartum suicide attempt

2125677 the repair of stis and of acs in particular involves techniques that the astronauts have never performed on hubble possibly never before anywhere
2125678 that is to open up an instrument that was not designed to be opened up and actually pull out electronic printed circuit boards and replace them with new boards
2125679 personally i think thats where the more exciting results will come from after this servicing mission
2125680 the new ideas that astronomers have about how to use these wonderful instruments now that theyre all together in a set that is internally complementary
2125681 at the end of sm4 when the astronauts leave hubble for the last time we have a very good prospect that hubble will be at the apex of its capabilities it will be better than its ever been before which is quite awesome when you realize that it will be over eighteen years old as an observatory
2125682 strive to develop procedures technology and equipment that would allow the safe servicing of the hubble space telescope including the possible use of tele operated robots

2125684 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older
2125685 often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
2125686 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
2125687 you can have children tested early so they dont have speech or school problems
2125688 and because it winds itself up to the forest canopy and spreads it can cover as much canopy area as a community of trees
2125689 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c0 2
2125690 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
2125691 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance

2125696 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
2125697 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
2125698 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change

2125700 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2125701 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2125702 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2125703 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2125704 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2125705 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
2125706 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence
2125707 as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
2125708 its important for people to understand that this ambulatory form of treatment exists is successful and can be widely implemented in resource poor settings

2125711 bio fuels from wood are the area in which norway and sweden have most to gain
2125712 technically and economically it is possible to extract as much as 20 kilowatt hours kwh of energy a year in norway in addition to todays withdrawal
2125713 in order to achieve this large amounts of bio mass are required possibly as much as one million tonnes
2125714 the most accessible bio masses have already been harvested so we have to go further out and higher up we can increase profitability if this is carried out in connection with other measures to add value such as thinning sites for tourism power lines roadsides urban biomass and agro waste
2125715 lignin is the compound that cross links different fibres and enables the tree to stand vertically up to one third of the dry mass of the wood is lignin
2125716 compared to cellulose lignin has not been exploited to the same degree but it can now be utilised for biodiesel and other fuel components the challenge is to develop oil resembling todays oil products from fossil sources
2125717 we added a special solvent that conveyed the hydrogen to lignin
2125718 in this way we managed to break the lignin down into several products including pyrolysis oil that can be mixed into the petrol
2125719 the entire tree must be converted into different products in an effective refining process
2125720 lignin can now be used for biodiesel turpentine charcoal and other fuel components with optimal refining it is possible to exploit 60 80 percent of the energy that is conveyed and the process can be profitable in the space of 10 years
2125721 norway has oil refineries that produce different chemicals and there is nothing stopping us from establishing bio refineries that use wood and agricultural products to make similar products
2125722 borregaard and norske skog are both experts when it comes to processing wood a bio refinery like borregaard currently makes around 250 products from lignin
2125723 brazilian authorities believe their production of bioethanol from sugar cane does not compete with food production
2125724 we can achieve commercial production in norway within five years
2125725 part of our nordic collaboration project is to study whether existing oil refineries or paper mills can be used to produce bioethanol
2125726 we are presently dealing with a recalcitrant group of milf which appeared to be disregarding the call of their leaders to vacate certain areas in north cotabato

2125733 weve seen the increased numbers of foreign fighters in eastern and southern afghanistan this year and there is an expectation that the leadership in pakistan will do something about these militant sanctuaries in their country
2125734 to minimize the excessive use by contractors of subcontractors or tiers of subcontractors to perform the principal work of the contract

2125751 they spent the last few years trying to integrate it
2125752 there are a lot of questions that a buyer and the government would have to have
2125753 improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2125754 every piece of the business is for sale at a certain price right now because they continue to struggle
2125755 even if they want to sell iden i dont think theres a buyer
2125756 ill do a series of meetings with the hgtv people and some phone calls and from there my life changes
2125757 its all kind of still happening but its full steam ahead toward the show
2125758 the goal is to do a show where people could learn and laugh and not feel that they wasted 30 minutes of their life
2125759 my husband and i have always been on a budget when we try to do things in our own home and with our clients as well
2125760 so the idea is how do you make something cost efficient look like you spent a million bucks
2125761 the first thing you hear when you win the show is your lifes going to change
2125762 you know the payoff will be great but you also know its going to be a ton of work theres a lot of nervous excitement you know youre going to have to produce but luckily for me i have the 100 percent support of my husband and thats what it takes to make this happen
2125763 while i was off filming he cared for the business
2125764 and he even got us more business so hes the unsung hero
2125765 and i was willing to go that extra step to help make it happen but shes the star in our family thats for sure i am so proud of her anyone who knows jen knows she really deserves this
2125766 were walking around in a daze i know our lives are going to change tenfold but its something to look forward to
2125767 cause if you have to do the clap and back away the move the loser is asked to make to give the winner the spotlight then i was going to fall down so i was just thinking how i was going to back away
2125768 its very ambitious the melodies are lennon and mccartney and the song structures are kind of all over the place its homage to all my indulgences
2125769 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2125770 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
2125771 another problem is that the carbon economy of glucose fermentation is poor
2125772 for every 10 g of ethanol produced you also release 9 6 g co 2
2125773 our method appears to be the most efficient conversion of cellulose into simple hydrophobic organic compounds described to date
2125774 it also surpasses the carbon yields of glucose and sucrose fermentation furanics could be established as both the automotive energy source and chemical starting material of the future
2125775 we are determined to take strong action against these sites
2125776 we have received complaints from passengers who have not been informed of changes to their flight because our notifications are sent to the email of the price comparison company which booked the flight not the customer
2125777 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2125778 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2125779 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2125780 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits

2125782 the 70s had a whole bunch of bad clothes but my wardrobe was picked out for me from the good stuff i actually had to lose weight for the role so that i could have a skinnier more 70s physique ive been starving for a year
2125783 it was named sebastian and thats gotten out of control
2125784 the moment they called wrap on the last episode i shaved it off i feel like myself again i was at a restaurant the other day and a woman asked me if i was a porn star
2125785 i think the title is a bit strange i dont think its something that people would run into theaters to see
2125786 im so glad so many people loved the show the way they did and they can still watch the dvds
2125787 a lot of people say thats just the relationship i had with my mother or i wish i had that relationship with my mother
2125788 your job is to try and see it as a play just another play to take each scene as it comes and play it as truthfully and as energetically as you can
2125789 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2125790 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2125791 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
2125792 the study of marine mammal acoustics and behavior is an area of emerging interest for many reasons but there have been many recent advances including this recently completed study
2125793 we were fortunate to have some of the best scientists in these fields working with noaa on this pilot project it will take some time to analyze the data and see what conclusions may be drawn but in many ways this effort lays the foundation for more sophisticated collaborative efforts in the future

2125795 this is the chance for texans to take a look at the job senator cornyn has been doing in washington and decide whether to rehire him or to fire him but senator cornyn doesnt even want to show up for the job interview
2125796 tough talk coming from a guy who had to be dragged kicking and screaming to a primary debate nonetheless we very much look forward to debating rick this fall on a host of issues including his plan to drill in iraq sue opec and his numerous votes against jessicas law just to name a few should be a good time
2125797 when someone tells you who they are believe them the first time
2125798 these changes will enable anz to offer our customers some very competitive fixed rates
2125799 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2125800 those short term funding costs have moved from an average of 10 basis points over the official cash rate to earlier this year to 100 points to last week 60 to yesterday 20
2125801 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks
2125802 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet
2125803 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2125804 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2125805 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2125806 the inspector observed waste unloading for some time and never observed county staff giving any attention to what was being thrown in the pit
2125807 were just a little bit caught off guard with this
2125808 were reviewing our processes on that and will make sure it doesnt happen in the future
2125809 based on the appearance of the asphalt and concrete in this area the requirements for spill containment and personal protection equipment are not being met

2125811 another car ploughed into the side pete was sitting it left a massive dent in the car door but thankfully pete walked out uninjured he was adamant he didnt want to go to hospital and made sure the other driver was ok not surprisingly he was badly shaken but immediately called jordan katie to reassure her that he wasnt hurt
2125812 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2125813 its sort of an odd time to be launching an ipo given the condition of the greater economy venture capital has been tight the last few months too
2125814 hosting companies are in an intriguing position with the ongoing drumbeat of web 2 0 saas and the usual hosted services the cloud proponents see it going public as an inevitability

2125818 now im trying to figure out what im going to do next
2125819 more than likely ill go in the private equity route or management consulting but specifically to retail consumer products
2125820 and i think part of life is you are going to have your ups and downs and obviously you are going to learn so ill take all the mistakes i made with my first business and apply it to whatever my second business is and take some of my successes and try to emulate some of my success
2125821 i wanted to become a big fish in a small pond
2125822 rather than be a t shirt company when there are a million of them so basically i projected a tough future 12 months and i knew i had to pay back my investors when you are in business you are in it to make money at the end of the day it was wonderful going through the process of growing and selling a business i paid everybody back and made out with my shirt and a great experience
2125823 when you are doing trade negotiations for companies i always thought it would be interesting to be on the side of the company not just the mediator
2125824 i knew i always wanted to go into business and i knew i always wanted to have some international component growing up i was raised to work hard and if you believe in something to go for it
2125825 wabash prepares you to ask the right questions to be an able thinker

2125828 we are up 38 eligible shows from just two years ago and were only continuing to grow
2125829 policy differences wont lead to demotion of the central bank governor
2125830 but if that difference is so wide one policy must stay and the other must go
2125831 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
2125832 a loss like that would stop most people in their tracks and it would be completely understandable
2125833 the fact that he didnt think about changing his plans is a reflection of his character his strength and determination
2125834 its difficult to entrust your life to an inanimate object
2125835 i tried to beat the weeds back with my cane so that i could stay on the sidewalk but that didnt work too well
2125836 if i turn my head when im talking to people
2125837 he rode a bicycle he marched in the high school band
2125838 he never looked at things and said i cant do it
2125839 its one of those things that i think people should know
2125840 but i dont want to say oh by the way im blind
2125841 edward represented the link between pauls visual impairment and the independence he so desires
2125842 without depending on other people he could go it alone
2125843 ive never seen him break down like he did when edward died
2125844 and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2125845 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2125846 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2125847 it is important the world recognize that this is justice and not revenge
2125848 i wish you godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2125849 and i hope that you are able to be a father and a provider and a husband in the best sense of the word
2125850 i know staff in washington are working very hard on this issue
2125851 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2125852 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
2125853 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
2125854 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
2125855 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
2125856 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
2125857 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
2125858 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
2125859 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
2125860 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
2125861 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
2125862 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities
2125863 if network operators cant manage traffic loads one way theyll do it another by banning discrimination based on application or content the fcc and net neutrality proponents more broadly are pushing network operators closer and closer to what increasingly is their only viable alternative usage based pricing
2125864 the best thing that ever happened to the network operator crowd
2125865 the worst thing that ever happened to applications and content
2125866 these assertions are simply untrue by stirring up fears of higher monthly bills this posturing attempts to delegitimize the commissions worthy action giving consumers the false impression that they must choose between secret internet blocking or the very undesirable practice of metering
2125867 this is a false choice one most providers dont even consider necessary or practical these scare tactics shouldnt deter anyone from pursuing the policies we need to preserve a free and open internet
2125868 but to believe such a move is right around the corner we must accept the argument that there is congestion in the network
2125869 predicting the internets catastrophic collapse and ghost sites galore in 1996
2125870 almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the internets continuing exponential growth but i predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse
2125871 bell canada was forced to disclose the level of congestion in its network after canadian regulators began an investigation into the companys practice of application throttling the data indicated almost no congestion in bell canadas network despite the companys prediction of a bandwidth apocalypse
2125872 isps may well buck the historical trends and economic incentives and move forward with limitation pricing anyway
2125873 cable isps may be particularly worried about the threat that online video poses to their own video products and might turn to limitation pricing as a way of disfavoring services like netflix appletv vudu hulu vuze miro and a whole host of commercial online video distribution applications
2125874 the atps tennis anti corruption program is clear that gambling on any form of tennis match is prohibited
2125875 all in our sport have a duty to uphold all those rules designed to protect the integrity of tennis and the atp will continue to instigate disciplinary proceedings against anyone found to have committed an offense
2125876 we want to dramatically simplify the process of buying and selling ads online
2125877 its certainly our goal to raise problems or issues prior to the trademark being published and a notice of allowance being issued

2125885 local studio artists felt they never got the audience the other two weekends got
2125886 they have as much opportunity as they want to put in the effort to get
2125887 i know its a shift but its just a physical shift not a philosophical shift
2125888 why dont you advertise outside new haven why arent we on npr
2125889 how do i choose which of those weekends to put all the marketing effort into and how do i tell this audience of collectors and curators outside new haven if i can only choose one weekend which weekend is best for them
2125890 its just a phone call a yes or no answer
2125891 there is a lot of vacant space unfortunately but it is spread out not in big 150 000 square foot chunks
2125892 it needs to have a year round person in the office which has never been the case weve had temporary directors of open studios who start in july and its just not soon enough
2125893 as a captain at wabash he served as an assistant coach for me he also knows the high school tennis coaches and programs around the state of indiana adam will do a tremendous job at earlham just as he did as a member of the wabash tennis team
2125894 a community manager should be one of the first hires right after a solid engineering group and
2125895 get up and do something about it shes right across the road
2125896 no im not im just careful she might be one of those sexy serial killers
2125897 taking a weird guy and convicting him of mass murder
2125898 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
2125899 they didnt talk about one thing that they got as result of all those searches
2125900 i just dont think he did it and i dont think the evidence exists
2125901 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
2125902 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
2125903 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
2125904 its closing a lot of things but its also opening up a lot of doors
2125905 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2125906 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2125907 this has been one of the largest domestic terrorism investigations in the fbis 100 year history and the investigative team made mistakes missteps and false accusations
2125908 has been the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
2125909 the contaminant must have been introduced during the production of the post and brokaw spores
2125910 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
2125911 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
2125912 such apparently unrelated questions arise in the aftermath of the vote of the environment committee of the spanish parliament last month to grant limited rights to our closest biological relatives the great apes chimpanzees bonobos gorillas and orangutans the committee would bind spain to the principles of the great ape project which points to apes human qualities including the ability to feel fear and happiness create tools use languages remember the past and plan the future the projects directors peter singer the princeton ethicist and paola cavalieri an italian philosopher regard apes as part of a community of equals with humans
2125913 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2125914 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2125915 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2125916 nbcs strategy is based on an end to end cisco architecture built on top of cisco routers and video encoding systems as well as our wan wide area network acceleration technology the cisco waas
2125917 this uses some key innovations the first and most important is a single unified network fabric built around the cisco 12000 router its a 450m bps network combining real time high definition broadcast contribution video voice and data from the points of creation into the studios in new york and los angeles
2125918 nbcs custom designed application tracks and documents literally millions of assets down to the individual camera and production equipment piece to coordinate all of the production and logistics around many events
2125919 it has to run flawlessly across various intercontinental links from china to several points in north america
2125920 this requires making low res copies of thousands of hours of competitions that are captured in our storage system in beijing and using a product called procast a video acceleration management product that proxies the images over to another media grid storage server in new york
2125921 we also have 40 at home editors we call them shot pickers using a vpn to either new york or la who make their shot selections using the proxies once they decide which shots they want to make a deliverable piece with then the system sends the proxies back to beijing to nbcs data center headquarters where the high res clips are called up from the main arrays to match the low res mpg4 proxies that have been selected
2125922 wed clog up the cisco data pipes between the at home editors new york and beijing if we didnt use proxies
2125923 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2125924 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2125925 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2125926 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2125927 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2125928 well if they have russian passports then they know where to move to georgia has every right to evict them out of their sovereign lands neil frankfurt germany 08 8 2008 11 54
2125929 they spent the last few years trying to integrate it
2125930 there are a lot of questions that a buyer and the government would have to have
2125931 improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2125932 every piece of the business is for sale at a certain price right now because they continue to struggle
2125933 even if they want to sell iden i dont think theres a buyer
2125934 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2125935 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2125936 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2125937 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2125938 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2125939 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2125940 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2125941 we are not ruling out that the lock has been tampered with
2125942 they have gone above the ceiling to explore all possibilities
2125943 they havent found a snake and they havent found a breach
2125944 we dont think he was physically quite with the rest of the team
2125945 we worked him back and he probably could have went back on the field this morning but because of our situation having to sign the tackle yesterday we had to make a move and the most obvious place for us right now is to let a back go we like the kid though i can tell you all that
2125946 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2125947 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2125948 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2125949 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2125950 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2125951 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2125952 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2125953 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2125954 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
2125955 there are dozens if not hundreds of scientists contractors students professors who used that same anthrax the very anthrax that would have the same genetic component
2125956 it is reasonable to conclude that the federal eagle envelopes utilized in the attacks were purchased from a post office in maryland or virginia
2125957 post offices that service the entire width of the state of maryland and then the biggest post office in the state of virginia
2125958 dr ivins had not spent this many off hours in the lab at any time before or after this period
2125959 i got your e mail making me wonder if you thought that i was trying to get something from you by sending you care packages christmas or birthday gifts etc that had me rather worried so i decided to send you the things but from different places and with different names
2125960 where is a witness that can put him in new jersey
2125961 there is no motive that has been suggested to me that makes any sense
2125962 it is frightening to me as a citizen and certainly as a defense attorney for people to characterize citizens who have trouble or questions or disputes with members of congress as having a dark side
2125963 thats the only thing i can comment to that that does not prove a thing
2125964 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2125965 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2125966 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2125967 while we have stayed away from that enquirer report because we couldnt confirm it this the charlotte observer s report strikes us as a legitimate story that on the record dems including a former edwards campaign manager are criticizing edwards decision to stay mum on the topic and saying it might affect his credibility enough that he wouldnt get a speaking slot at the convention
2125968 with everyone from drudge to leno to wonkette riffing on a tale that began trickling out at christmas the msm look foolishly out of touch by continuing to remain silent about the allegation that edwards fathered the girl recently born to a former campaign aide
2125969 iwanna be the candidate for everyone including people with confederate flags in their window
2125970 we have received a number of complaints about the flying of the union flag throughout the 26 counties on the event of the opening of the olympic games in beijing
2125971 id be a great crime scene investigator private detective or criminal profiler
2125972 if you were a cereal what kind would you be
2125973 if youve felt or been told you have a photographic memory you might be an s
2125974 okay so what can you do to make that happen
2125975 other people had gotten her to her doorway so i just went and was trying to help my neighbour stay calm
2125976 people were throwing rocks at the bear to get it to go away and it just wouldnt budge it just kept trying to come towards her
2125977 it got really close but luckily one of the other ladies who was also helping had a broom or stick and started hitting the bear and screaming and managed to get it away
2125978 one of her arms has been badly mauled and the back of her skull has been badly attacked as well
2125979 she said that what i was doing offended other customers and that there were children around
2125980 i felt humiliated i didnt want to be put in isolation
2125981 why do people still see breastfeeding as something obscene as something to be ashamed of its all about the over sexualization of breasts were forgetting about their primary function
2125982 an h amp m staffer was trying to offer the customer the option of using one of our fitting rooms if she wished
2125983 we say to moms breastfeed but dont do it in front of me it means mothers are relegated to caves or cant leave their homes
2125984 there a definite public health benefit these mothers are saving us tax dollars we should be thanking them not sending them off to another room
2125985 we have a funny idea about breasts in our society
2125986 they use them to sell cars and women can go topless in this country so this kind of puzzles me
2125987 80 quipes dedf restent mobilis es sur ces trois d partements et plus de 150 chantiers sont actuellement en cours de r alisation pour r tablir au plus vite lalimentation lectrique sur lensemble du r seau de distribution delectricit
2125988 whenever we have a situation like this we always hope for the best outcome and unfortunately in this situation we didnt have any survivors
2125989 its very difficult terrain so it makes things a little bit riskier
2125990 the helicopter was left inverted in the river and kitsault is known as being a very fast moving river which increases the difficulties
2125991 very experienced a very good pilot one of the best in the industry
2125992 its tough on everybody a sad day for this company and our hearts go out to the families of the other victims
2125993 weve gone through tons of ups and downs and hes very supportive in helping my mother and myself and my sister deal with the grief of losing our father to cancer and helping to create a stable and a secure family home for us
2125994 he was quite a crazy character definitely a glass is half full kind of guy
2125995 he was in lots of little planes all year round going all over b c in all sorts of weather so it was definitely a risk that was out there and something that he and the family were aware of obviously
2125996 but you just never think its going to happen to you
2125997 being a log loaders what he wanted to be all his life
2125998 the point of the lawsuit is to seek indemnity in relation to all of the costs associated and incurred in respect of the cleanup
2125999 im not sure it would go to court to be honest these sorts of things have a way of resolving outside of courts
2126000 whoever is found to be responsible and that could be a number of parties they need to pay for the full rehabilitation of the affected estuary and any indirect damage to the fish stocks and ecosystem
2126001 im not confident that will happen unfortunately most corporations do not seem to have that degree of commitment
2126002 honey we dont need material things to prove our love

2126009 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2126010 i was walking down the street and this guy stopped me and told me id dropped something
2126011 i remember when i was nine months pregnant with my daughter jean i was cleaning floors with my big belly
2126012 i have to say that over the past 13 years all of my efforts have been to prove i can do better
2126013 and when you look at the olympics you can see the chinese government making a similar effort to show the world that we are doing better
2126014 on the surface it appeared that i was poorer less educated but that created desire a feeling that i can be as tall as you i can do anything as good as you
2126015 i did not think id come back until i realized the opportunities were here
2126016 if i had been born in australia or the united states i doubt very much i would have had the same level of variety in my life or the same desire the same drive for success
2126017 i believe part of the reason i have achieved so much is the life i have been through
2126018 at this stage of my life i dont have to prove myself anymore
2126019 the past 13 years have all been work work work not much quality of life
2126020 and i lost the taste for judging right from wrong for my flesh had turned to fur and my thoughts they surely were turned to instinct and obedience to god

2126029 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2126030 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2126031 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2126032 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2126033 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2126034 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2126035 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2126036 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2126037 were reviewing it and in all likelihood we will file
2126038 respecting the standards that protect children from abuse we immediately removed him from ministry and will authorize an independent investigation to learn the facts surrounding the allegations
2126039 these letters reflect the pastoral style of the oblates especially when reaching out to listen to concerns about its members
2126040 as soon as possible the oblates will respond in a way that addresses the facts related to the issues raised in these correspondence and the lawsuit filed that includes a man who has desired anonymity by use of the name john doe
2126041 while there are more than a few reasons for you to wonder about the appropriateness of how your complaints and concerns have been dealt with from this point forward i feel that the two of us have cleared the air in matters concerning father killion
2126042 at that time i was generally appraised of the incident to which you refer in your may 9th 2002 meeting
2126043 father killion his on site supervisors as well as his local religious superiors and counselors
2126044 father killions professional and personal integration with students has been beyond reproach and he continues to do good work in the ministry
2126045 if someone accused of abusing children gets transferred transferred and transferred with no consequences its unlikely that hell stop being a child abuser
2126046 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2126047 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights

2126057 there is a chance that some of the balloons will attempt an ascent on saturday morning but wet and windy weather will scupper any hopes of an evening ascent

2126060 maywand is to our knowledge an insurgent logistical node where things like bombs get made and moved to other districts
2126061 so we certainly anticipate that seizing bomb making supplies in maywand will have an effect of what will show up in zahri in the future
2126062 convincing the people of afghanistan there is a legitimate and viable option in supporting the government
2126063 and based on finds and some of the site exploitation going on any insurgents in the area that did manage to get out had to do so in a hurry because they left exploitable material behind
2126064 a large find of ied components homemade explosives a large quantity of that was found and destroyed in place
2126065 we know this area of maywand district is a feeder for other areas
2126066 we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we would be able to cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other areas aside from just localized effect in band e timor

2126073 i hate people who come on reality shows i know ive come on but its for the experience i hate people who try to stick around after it
2126074 the thing is the people ive spoken to dont like it when they turn on and everybody is screaming it depends on the characters thats why the celebrity one is so popular
2126075 id have dinner with the guy and wed talk about sports or hed ask me about my life was i dating anyone
2126076 he was a priest but he was a normal guy
2126077 ive seen a couple that had actually gotten in trouble and i thought ok i can see that not so with father killion

2126093 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
2126094 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
2126095 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree
2126096 and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see
2126097 i am nine days in and i have spent nearly all of them visiting my customers really getting to understand their business listening to their thoughts and the collaboration word is firmly on my mind
2126098 consumers are going for lower price points and impulse buying has almost disappeared which is a worry six months ago consumers would walk in and buy items worth 40 now they are saying ill have a think about it
2126099 the business market is just the opposite because people need kit to do their job
2126100 firms are holding back on spending on it unless it is absolutely necessary
2126101 this is an exciting one for our channel but its one we have to get right its also something that my competitors to the best of my knowledge dont have
2126102 if account registration will do what they say they will create a phenomenal program that will be something all companies will look at as a milestone and something to replicate
2126103 i think its a good idea dont get me wrong but there has to be a reason that youre able to register that account
2126104 id really need to know how they do it if someone calls to order direct its hard for me to believe dell is going to turn that order down because a var registered them
2126105 its important to register the account not just a deal i was working on
2126106 however the downside is if youre doing a poor job of service it becomes a challenge for both the customer and a different partner that wants to be involved to get engaged
2126107 none of this would have been possible if we didnt focus solely on health care
2126108 the problem is none of the big players in the cloud computing market have embraced the channel

2126111 a true example of everything we could wish for in a public servant
2126112 he embodied the true meaning of compassion every time he helped his son with a school project or gave his mother half of his paycheck during high school
2126113 he wrote a memorable story of success and bravery of courage and commitment of an obligation to help and protect others los angeles is worse off today because this guardian angel is no longer with us
2126114 what a shame to lose someone so special and with so many values
2126115 i guess the state of new jersey still hasnt caught on that we dont use their services
2126116 those residents pay their income tax pay the sales tax and on balance do not get the benefits of the state programs other more heavily populated areas get
2126117 we feel that in lowering the bill and putting that cap on it we certainly heard the concerns of the towns
2126118 it would allow us to spread our manpower into smaller municipalities who cant afford to have their own police force and better cover highways
2126119 youre looking at 1 200 per response which is ludicrous
2126120 the attorney general determined that those towns while they had police forces due to high violent crime rates and other public safety concerns they needed some help from the state police
2126121 theyre really trying unfortunately to balance the states budget on the backs of the rural municipalities
2126122 its something that is mandated and we dont have the money budgeted for it
2126123 ever since the end of last summer we have seen blow away numbers on the job creation side so does two months make a trend
2126124 keep in mind that when economies slow down a little bit a lot of people actually enroll in universities and do self enriching things so that theyre better prepared to compete in a job market
2126125 the only significant job gains were in accommodation and food services where 22 000 people were hired across the country
2126126 the job losses happened in quebec ontario saskatchewan and prince edward island quebec lost 30 000 jobs and the provincial jobless rate rose to 7 4 per cent ontario lost 19 000 jobs although its unemployment rate actually dropped to 6 4 per cent from 6 7 per cent when about 42 000 people left the job market
2126127 thats because many people especially younger part time workers left the workforce
2126128 it was amazing i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2126129 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2126130 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
2126131 they hope that through the olympics the international community will get a better sense of where china is today which they say is a very modern and very different china from a few years ago
2126132 a lot is on the line for the chinese government certainly also for the chinese people there is so much pride and nationalism here
2126133 this has been a very ominous video tape that has emerged it shows the 2008 logo up in flames and also a simulated explosion over one of the venues

2126137 throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2126138 unequivocally held that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry under the california constitution
2126139 the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry

2126147 there are fundamental investors who still believe that in the long term this is the right trade

2126154 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water

2126157 i think we have designed a system that has addressed a major concern people had about the local driver
2126158 this is just another interim step toward the final goal
2126159 the pennsylvania turnpike commission has a 67 year history of over promising and under delivering
2126160 so i 80 motorists shouldnt get too excited about any plan that portends to offer driver discounts
2126161 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2126162 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2126163 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2126164 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2126167 so to my conservative friends i will say i agree with you that those churches that tout their inclusiveness are often so wishy washy and touchy feely that no one will ever be challenged to repent that repentance and conversion seem anathema that their version of the gospel is even more watered down than my version

2126182 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2126183 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2126184 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2126185 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2126196 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule
2126197 and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
2126198 china will continue to follow a good neighborly policy towards myanmar and work with the international community to help myanmar overcome difficulties
2126199 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and dream for the day the people will be free
2126200 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
2126201 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma
2126202 china can help our democratization process by putting pressure on the military regime
2126203 we will never forget we will never give up 1988
2126204 ive totally lost hope that change will come through mass protests
2126205 its difficult to organize protests now because most of the leaders are in jail or in hiding
2126206 i cannot participate the way i did in 1988 i am older now and have a family to take care of
2126207 those were the days and i dont expect demonstrations of that scale to ever take place again in the country
2126208 a lot of people are saying what has gone wrong
2126209 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago

2126246 the ioc cant stress enough the importance of purchasing tickets through official and authorized sources only sadly there are some fraudulent dealers who are out to cheat fans something we deplore
2126247 in a case of fraudulent activity recently in the united states the usoc supported by the ioc moved swiftly to shut down the sites
2126248 any time you buy from someone thats not us youre taking a risk that the tickets wont be valid
2126249 theres websites out there that look official they have official sounding names and you really struggle potentially if you didnt know what youre doing to tell the difference
2126250 where theres a lot of money at stake and you know theres a high demand for tickets people look to take advantage of that
2126251 once this happens either for a family or a business theres really nothing we can do to help them by that time all our tickets are spoken for and we cant build extra seats to help these people as much as we might like to so somebodys experience of a lifetime becomes a disappointment of a lifetime

2126300 because he is a vampire and loves her so much he puts himself though so much pain to be with her not that we want edward to be in pain but it shows how much he loves her
2126301 when you have sex with a vampire it can be very romantic it doesnt have to be violent
2126302 as i got older its more the sexual aspect of it
2126303 they have that seductive side but in an instant they can be all like feral you secretly want something a little dangerous a little exciting to spice up your life
2126304 because i read twilight i have unrealistic expectations in men
2126305 or maybe its that he is always there when we need him no matter what maybe its that he is capable of love that we mere humans would never be able to comprehend
2126306 maybe its that we not only want someone to save us but we want someone to save as well
2126307 its quite a deep psychological escape so when theyre reading this formula women really are in another world
2126308 they see a girl thats clumsy and depressed and they think im better than she is
2126309 its a boost of self confidence to see that someone like bella can get someone like edward whos good and true and unselfish
2126310 you would think that a vampires evil but he actually has morals
2126311 he could very well do what he wants with her because she would let him hes set on doing whats best for bella

2126318 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2126319 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2126320 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard
2126321 we find that theres really either open hostility or passive resistance to unions
2126322 the gap between general principles and practices at the local level
2126323 embarrass and harass the sisters to knuckle down into an agreement

2126331 mukherjee beautifully weaves the ever morphing web of technology business and organizational learning together and explains why both top executives and middle managers must care about their impact
2126332 the business world is moving toward non hierarchical networks the answer to these changes is a combination of network management and collaborative leadership mukherjee goes beyond description of best practices the four design principles that he has developed to implement networks are conceptually well thought through and actionable this book deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in tomorrows organization
2126333 an adaptive organization must count as the response in the increasingly connected world in which business will operate in the decades ahead
2126334 beyond the obvious this is a great and pragmatic book demonstrating the incredible power of collaboration in action
2126335 though many have sought to unlock the secrets of creating learning organizations few have succeeded in the spiders strategy mukherjee provides the keys to the learning kingdom and he shows what it really takes to leverage the power of networks it is that rare business book that deserves to be read from cover to cover
2126336 mukherjee has written a very thoughtful and thought provoking book the adaptive network perspective with its four design principles and the accompanying five capabilities inspired by a chief network officer will be the organizations of the present and future the book presents good theory research grounded in facts and a clear picture of what is both necessary and possible going forward

2126360 now a new kind of punishment called jet plane ride is invented
2126361 report on an investigation of the peasant movement in hunan
2126362 we still use kneeling and dunce hat wearing as ways of punishment
2126363 i have always objected to this kind of practice you cannot deal with cadres in the same way as you deal with landlords we have a good tradition that is unity criticism unity
2126364 killing is always bad being killed is bad killing others is not good either attack retaliation kneeling dunce hat wearing sign carrying oh yes there is another way of punishment the jet plane type all these are not good

2126381 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2126382 it was tough to listen on the radio listening to bluefield go win state and richlands make it to state i was real happy for them but we want to be in that position
2126383 i feel real good about this year and i just hope we can accomplish our dream
2126384 last year was a little different situation it was very tough to adjust from a third string freshman to a starting sophomore
2126385 i got thrown in the fire really quick but now i feel real confident because i have a great group of seniors and a great line in front of me to protect me
2126386 last year really did help us it was tough but it showed what kind of team strength that we had
2126387 our composure was never lost we were able to bounce back and end up with a very very great season so we look to build off of that
2126388 it would be nice to start 3 0 but its not how you start its how you finish thats something that coach marrs tells us and thats what we look at
2126389 the thing that helped david improve is everybody around him improved too
2126390 every position improved as the year went along which gave him a little bit more confidence and a little bit more time
2126391 its a great feeling to be out here its pretty bittersweet at the beginning having to get up so early and having to come out but once we got started and got rolling there was a lot of fire a lot of intensity
2126392 its great to be out here with a great group of guys that really want to win and improve and try to take this program back to the way it used to be and try to bring that back
2126393 weve got a great backfield coming in and lot of different weapons that is just a great plus to have its hard to explain how excited i am to be quarterback again
2126394 it doesnt bother me one bit if we can run and put up maybe about 300 rushing yards a game and hopefully about 900 touchdowns
2126395 it doesnt bother me just as long as we get in the end zone it doesnt matter if we throw it run it or just anyway we can get in there
2126396 its great to have so many weapons running the ball doesnt bother me one bit
2126397 hes a really calm guy he does what hes supposed to do he doesnt turn the ball over and hes a smart kid im really excited about him being behind me
2126398 theyre big and strong and theyll work hard to get us a win
2126399 j k was great to have last year too bad he had to leave but weve got a lot of guys with some hands
2126400 torren was a big receiver that stepped up last year as a sophomore i look to throw to him a lot and then the backs dominique and kyle look to catch it and run
2126401 its nice to have those guys with speed and hands thats a good combo
2126402 ive tried to jump in on defense and then ive quickly been tossed out of it
2126403 ill do whatever they need me to play defense kick or fill the water coolers whatever they need me to do
2126404 you cant base it on what happened the year before but we feel like we are in a good position because last year we tied for the district with a great team richlands that ended up going to state
2126405 we would like to go a little longer this season
2126406 we have been playing good the guys have been working hard
2126407 you have to give them credit for that but we have to throw this one away tonight and start tomorrow again
2126408 you have to give credit to the other team they came in and swung the bat well in situations where they need to do it
2126409 we made too many errors in one inning and thats a ball team that you cannot make that many errors like that against
2126410 even early in the game we had a runner at third base and one out and we had some chances and we could not do it
2126411 we had a chance to come back and win the game but that ninth inning was very ugly we havent had an ugly game like that in a long time
2126412 we thought we had a chance if we score early in the game
2126413 when they were up 2 0 and we had a runner at third base and we didnt score it could have been a different ball game because we could have got closer and played a tie game for a little while

2126417 we were more patient at the plate i think we walked like nine times
2126418 im just really focusing on every single pitch concentrating on every single pitch and locating my fastball in and out and keeping the ball at the knees
2126419 im so used to pitching at home in front of the home crowd they get behind your backs ready to get a little more adrenaline going definitely a lot easier to pitch at home than on the road
2126420 he did it tonight im not sure that he had that good stuff that he usually do before hes pitching well hes locating his pitches and everything
2126421 the thing is they want to learn to play the game with a winning attitude with respect for the game and theyre doing it somebody different is doing something different and thats encouraging
2126422 its a captive audience literally and sometimes involuntarily for an extended period of time so there are certainly opportunities to make contact with potential consumers in flight

2126429 i just dont feel that for the price the actual exposure would be enough for the company
2126430 if an organization finds value in advertising on a tray table on a boarding pass or on the in flight entertainment system then i commend the airline for identifying another important revenue opportunity

2126460 they wanted to have that trophy right there in the team picture the thing is it was a little bit big and it was hard to find a place to put it up
2126461 after we won it all of the guys celebrated there and they were very excited very happy
2126462 and that was a good thing because fans came down with players and everybody was together there it was a lot of fun
2126463 it means a lot because i feel proud and i feel very happy for my players
2126464 they played so hard to get to that point and anytime you win something and a cup like that you have to be proud of your players and proud of that especially with the fans over here they deserve it
2126465 i enjoyed being here in bluefield i think bluefields a beautiful city and they have some beautiful people here and winning that trophy was more beautiful than anything else
2126466 one of my goals is to do the world series in girls softball and boys baseball
2126467 a lot of guys try to get there its more of a goal than anything
2126468 and once i started i stayed in the system with her and we were still doing baseball at the same time
2126469 probably the most difficult thing for all umpires is to slow yourself down and call what you see and not what you think the most difficult thing is that everything happens very fast and youve got to make very difficult decisions
2126470 every time you go up a level the competition gets better and the pace gets a little quicker
2126471 little league umpiring is volunteer work you dont get paid for it the best part is just being around the kids being around the game seeing them play they cant play without us
2126472 but your vacation time is on your own the travel time is on your own the whole nine yards
2126473 giving something back to the kids giving back to the community
2126474 there have been several of the boys in high school that we start bringing through it makes them better ball players it gives them a little better appreciation of the umpires
2126475 as soon as bernardo drew that walk i looked at the person next to me and said were going to win this game
2126476 and sure enough rodolfo cardona had a big hit we scored two runs won the game it couldnt have happened in a better way winning in the bottom of the ninth down one scoring two runs it was pretty exciting
2126477 the first thing everyone on the team said to me was calling me the vulture for stealing the win
2126478 my dad kind of got me into it when i was real young real little
2126479 and i was pushing the ball across the floor when i was young i was two i can contribute everything to him
2126480 it was tough all my best friends played on the lacrosse team nobody really knew we had a baseball team they knew but it was all lacrosse the athletic department revolved around the lacrosse team
2126481 i had a couple starts my sophomore year in high school but didnt really make it my primary position
2126482 when i was a junior in high school was when i started pitching regularly
2126483 i used to be pretty wild and i liked hitting more but i dont know what happened i guess my senior year i had some success and i found out how to throw strikes and i started liking it
2126484 sometimes i got too conscious of just trying to blow it by people
2126485 so towards the end of my junior year and senior year i focused more on throwing strikes and realizing that there were seven people behind me trying to make plays for me i dont have to get them all out myself
2126486 but i had a meeting with the coach and he just wanted me to focus on pitching so we kind of got rid of the whole hitting thing but i knew i had a brighter future as a pitcher instead of an offensive player
2126487 to tell you the truth i didnt even know they were interested until the day of the draft
2126488 i knew they came out a couple games to see my college team but we had a couple other big prospects our first baseman our center fielder both got drafted and i got letters from other teams but i dont think i ever got anything from the orioles
2126489 so when my name popped up on the day of the draft i was kind of surprised but im happy im a local guy and if i had a choice of which team to pull for then it would have been the orioles
2126490 ive been throwing strikes for the most part and just trying to let people clear the plate ive got seven professionals behind me whove been making plays all their life too so i dont have to get every one by myself
2126491 my pitching coach in college didnt really say too much to me and i think that was a good thing i had a lot of work to do in college with my mechanics and everything and troy has helped me out with everything
2126492 i feel i keep throwing the way i am right now at least next year will be all right for me
2126493 but i dont know later on down the road i guess its not going to be easy it never is to move up a level ill just have to keep working hard keep throwing strikes and hopefully it all works out
2126494 i threw one inning so i cant give myself too much credit
2126495 im just not as competitive as i used to be and i dont want to occupy a spot in the tournament field that could be available for another golfer if i didnt play
2126496 i started playing in the tournament in 1971 one year after it was established
2126497 ive missed playing only two times since then once in the late 1970s and again in 1988 when i helped my son settle in as a freshman at virginia tech
2126498 i have so many wonderful memories associated with the pocahontas
2126499 i can remember the late hugh ike shott sitting in a golf cart by the 18th green during the early years of the tournament he spoke a word or two to every golfer as we finished the event
2126500 it has been wonderful to watch some of the young guys as they grew and improved year after year really the tournament is like a homecoming for several of us very much like a fraternity
2126501 often at the pocahontas i see people i havent talked to for a year we catch up on old times find out how our families are doing and enjoy a round
2126502 i plan on being as friendly as i can and still make certain the tournament starts and proceeds in a timely way
2126503 im sure there will be some light moments and i believe humor can be used as an ice breaker to help everyone relax and hopefully get off to a good start
2126504 i had just received the tournament invitation in the mail
2126505 and i was considering whether to enter pocahontas tournament director frank wilkinson called and asked me to serve as the starter and i agreed to do so
2126506 i felt a momentary pang of doubt when i made the decision not to compete but i want to be a player not just a participant
2126507 being the starter is the perfect way to stay connected to the pocahontas and to my friends at the tournament
2126508 our biggest problem right now is every mistake we make we make it at the worst possible time
2126509 we make a defensive mistake or a base running mistake or we dont make a good pitch with two outs or make a bad pitch
2126510 everything is just coming at the wrong time and every mistake counts as far as hurting us that is unfortunate you shouldnt be making a lot of the mistakes were making but when were make them were making them at the wrong time
2126511 theyre an older club theyre more experienced and theyre a good club and they have our number
2126512 we beat ourselves tuesday night i thought today we beat ourselves
2126513 the last four games weve played it wouldnt matter who we played were giving games away left and right
2126514 the frustrating thing to me is a lot of the mistakes that we are making we werent even making at the beginning of the year
2126515 to me its a lack of concentration a lack of focus a lack of thinking about a situation before it happen
2126516 whether its because theyre fatigued mentally or physical or whatever the reason i dont know they have to understand that cant happen we cant play like that because what is happening to us right now is going to happen to us
2126517 this is their livelihood this is their job and theyve got to get it
2126518 its kind of a little bit of everything at times our base running has been poor our defense has been poor our pitching has been poor our hitting has been poor
2126519 weve had games where all of them have not been where we would like them to be but right now it just seems that were making a lot of mistakes and every mistake we make is at a crucial time
2126520 its a nice change to be able to go out for dinner and have a nice dinner and be normal for a change that is kind of nice
2126521 weve got to go back to the drawing board and see what happens tomorrow
2126522 lenovo is growing across geographies and product lines continuing to bolster its already strong position in both developed markets and the fast growing emerging markets
2126523 this is going to be an explosion of economic development here as more people come down and buy their supplies and equipment down this road from the market area
2126524 where there was once a dirt road there is now an asphalt road for local commuters to travel on
2126525 i really love this seeing local civics in action and i really love seeing opportunities taken to give something back to a very deserving people
2126526 this is a tremendous honor and the first feeling that comes to mind is that dreams can come true
2126527 you never know when it will happen but with enough positive intention and belief it can i am ready willing and able to take on this great opportunity unfortunately this comes at the expense of a great athlete paul hamm my heart goes out to him he did an admirable thing and he will always be a hero in my eyes i also want to recognize the other two alternates who are an important part of the soul and spirit of this team
2126528 while i havent closed the chapter on that there is a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster going on while i am disappointed that i didnt make the squad im still a part of the team as an alternate which is an honor but at the same time i feel as if i did my job
2126529 i was so proud of that guy he was just amazing in every single aspect of what he did
2126530 his maturity and everything he has done this year impresses me
2126531 can take solace in his role as the star of the olympic trials and thats from no less an authority than bill foster
2126532 whether or not he reaches olympics bhavsar in the right place
2126533 it turns out the only accomplishment bhavsar wanted this week was to go out on there rock out his routines and have fun doing it
2126534 this time around there has been a very large following for myself and the media has taken quite an interest in my comeback and my philosophy on life which is absolutely wonderful
2126535 truth be told i actually did better than four years ago
2126536 what i found was that my ability to have fun my ability to enjoy the finer things in life that never went away
2126537 it started suddenly to dawn that if i can carry this same grounded approach for my next olympic run then no matter what happens i think i am going to be successful either way the motivation finally came back its not so much about training every day in the gym and perfecting a routine so much as it is about trying to be a good human being regardless of what happens in life
2126538 the important thing in the olympics is not to win but to take part just as in life the important thing is not the triumph but the struggle
2126539 probably the number one lesson that i learned out of all of this is that there is much more to being a great human being than getting in an olympic team or winning a war or having a high paying salary
2126540 currently the last page of this book has not been turned yet i am going to beijing maybe to compete maybe not but after that after a long vacation i am thinking about a couple things
2126541 public speaking is something that i have been interested in i think many people can relate to my story
2126542 many times in life we feel defeated and we take it personally and we give up the motivation we want to be successful i want to tell my story how i actually found the inner strength within me and how i fell in love again to excel in something
2126543 i believe that if i can do this so can you
2126544 it has been my dream since i was five years old to one day play in the olympics
2126545 my family has been my support group ever since i started playing
2126546 i would check the rankings every week to see how other people were doing and try to figure out where raju ranked
2126547 hes had a racket in his hand since he was a year and a half old
2126548 we would love to see it but its going to be tough the u s still lags behind asian countries when it comes to badminton
2126549 but there are always those magical olympian moments where someone goes on auto pilot and pulls out a medal
2126550 i had torn a hole in the cartilage of my right knee but my doctors werent able to figure it out for about six months it was a really frustrating time for me
2126551 im just happy to be playing for the u s at the games
2126552 in fact the budget bill was the very next item on the agenda but democrats chose to adjourn before we could take it up because they are afraid to debate the issue
2126553 virtual worlds are important because they provide a level of human interaction and experience that is increasing important in this disconnected world we live in plus they provide a platform for enhanced learning and collaboration
2126554 because of virtual worlds i have learned to do my job far better far faster and for the first time in 10 years of working now am part of a community of peers and i feel any discipline can do the same in here doctors could meet famous doctors they never would otherwise be able to students could be taught occasionally by top experts it makes these things affordable like the printing press made books common through lower cost
2126555 virtual worlds are the future of interfaces imho they are the conduit through which we will achieve human interaction without the major friction of actual physically relocating
2126556 oh my gosh that is the fattest cat ive ever seen let me tell you the man looks okay though
2126557 rampage lost the fight to forrest griffin he hung out in vegas for a week he was hanging out by the pool and he was fasting he wasnt drinking he wasnt eating he was drinking energy drinks
2126558 you saw what happened on tv the problems that he had they took him in for psychiatric evaluation for over 72 hours what they came back with was that there was nothing wrong with him mentally it was physically he was exhausted he had severe dehydration and that caused something called delirium
2126559 im already training so my next opponent better watch out
2126560 that was the worst mistake i ever made i got dana over my back all the time did you eat did you sleep drink your water its like im two years old but its all good i love dana man hes the first one to really take care of me and show me love
2126561 apparently they tell us hes over it now said white
2126562 he is healthy mentally and physically he will be back in the ufc soon
2126563 encantada con que se hable de la posibilidad de participar en la pel cula
2126564 concienciar a los j venes de la necesidad de cumplir con las normativas para evitar accidentes y sanciones
2126565 there are a pile of studies that ask the question a student who is at the halfway point in his medical education offers a provocative window on the
2126566 and then only to criticize the resident if the attending asks a question and the resident is wrong prepare to get yelled at if the attending asks a question and the resident is right prepared to get yelled at too if youve ever seen
2126567 the worst part of it all is that i havent been in surgery at all this week ive done so much scutwork that i havent seen a single surgery i dont even know where the or is
2126568 instead i fill my time with useless conferences where the resident presents the weeks cases and then a group of dinosaur attending physicians yell at him for two hours
2126569 i got back to find that one of our patients suffered a seizure and another had a pulmonary embolism while we were gone
2126570 some guy fell in the hallway out here theres a guy on the floor out here hes laying right over there
2126571 now go ahead and read your bible dennis and you go to your church and with any luck you might win the annual raffle but if youre looking for god he was in operating room number two on november seventeenth and he doesnt like to be second guessed
2126572 throughout the first 50 60 years of the 20 th century surgery was where the action was
2126573 halsted cushing and the mayo brothers among others made huge strides in what we could do
2126574 my physician grandfather told my newly med student father in 1942 that all he had was morphine sulfa digitalis in the form of powdered foxglove leaf and a bag full of useless nostrums
2126575 a few other things led to the long reign of surgeons
2126576 from the start health insurance plans favored things they could count like operations and which happened in hospitals also like operations
2126577 fancy internists and pediatricians were only to be found in big cities and they only trained for 3 years
2126578 surgeons are the playground bullies of the medical world any compassion and genuineness has been beaten out of them long ago theyre so used to talking to others through screaming that their encounters with students and residents are rarely pleasant thats not to say that all surgeons are like that urologists and ophthalmologists bring civility to the medical community
2126579 this particular case involved a rare type of cancer called medullary thyroid cancer
2126580 as i tried to hold her down the surgeon went right on cutting as if nothing was happening
2126581 few rotations are as anxiety producing as this one in addition to the general etiquette that was discussed earlier there are several new behaviors you will have to acquire on this rotation
2126582 in what way we would undoubtedly say yes to change and proceed to present a more humane training process and practice approach but why hasnt it changed is it the insistence of the authoritarian ethos or is there a down side to making what seem to be obvious changes what would it cost to the patient the surgeon and our society what would we gain
2126583 a good share of our tendency to favor expensive procedures and high utilization
2126584 is bound up in how our insurance system was constructed in the long dominance of proceduralists epitomized by surgeons
2126585 because i truly believe that it explains part of the skewed and crazy nature of our health care system my european physician friends are amazed at the dominance of surgeons here both in terms of income and political clout i think it helps explain a lot its also
2126586 is reasonable given the volume of work and the positive outcome
2126587 we thank tom flaherty and his team for their expert services
2126588 wvu also wants to thank this firm for their expert advice and services and very generous support
2126589 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2126590 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2126591 you want to address these issues long before you get to that point
2126592 otherwise people who havent written about it before now start writing about it
2126593 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do alright but the key is to plan ahead
2126594 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
2126595 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
2126596 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
2126597 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
2126598 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
2126599 the scheduled service part of our business is not making money so we are looking at ways to off set that
2126600 we just need a solution here to get us through the interim period and i view this as an investment
2126601 obviously sun country is near and dear to minnesota and it is an important cog in the wheel the competitive aspects at msp we need that if they can turn the corner financially
2126602 but just because his hand feels good doesnt mean hes ready to hit i dont need a body i need an offensive player
2126603 if youre under 40 that was a long time ago man
2126604 he already has the er letter set in his own name three times
2126605 like rog er fed er er thats why the judge ruled in our favor and gave roger the rights in perpetuity to er
2126606 they are commonly called er federers deal could bankrupt us
2126607 like you could just go rogxx fedxxxx is a tennis playxx and everybody would know what you mean
2126608 of course xx is hard to pronounce so it might be better to use something like oo instead so youd say rogoo fedoooo is a tennis playoo and now hes gonna be a lot richoo than evoo before
2126609 no one will want to use bett er if they have to pay for it
2126610 i expect people will now say good best bestest instead of good better best
2126611 in that usage i would say that rogoo fedooos new deal is the bestest deal signed in as long as i can rememboo his mothoo should be vooy vooy proud of him and mirka
2126612 esto no es ning n conflicto entre rusia y georgia es algo que rechazo categ ricamente
2126613 muchos de los que aparecen en esa lista tienen vinculaci n con el caso quirino y entre ellos hay dirigentes pol ticos militares de alto rango allegados a peloteros de grandes ligas banqueros inversionistas de alto calibre diplom ticos y ex diplom ticos funcionarios del actual gobierno y ex funcionarios del gobierno del prd personalidades ligadas al ambiente corporativo y financiero por lo que se tornaba muy delicado para la justicia dominicana ejecutar los arrestos y peticiones de extradici n sin previa consulta

2126615 y tengo que aclararte que en esa lista no s lo hay quienes est n ligados a las drogas hay muchos que son requeridos por otros delitos aunque no se cu les son
2126616 lo que s creo por mi experiencia en trabajos policiales es que quiz s quirino negoci e involucr a algunas personas a cambio de una sentencia leve y en juicio pr ximo l ser a el testigo estrella de la fiscal a federal
2126617 incluso precis en los pasillos de la embajada dominicana all
2126618 es m s se se usa el sentido com n sin irse muy lejos no es tan dif cil identificarlos
2126619 esto no es ning n conflicto entre rusia y georgia es algo que rechazo categ ricamente
2126620 is charlie rose producing the film it doesnt look particularly interesting or original and the acting looks mediocre charlie however made penelope cruz sounds brilliant and the film divine what gives
2126621 eso no significa que las autoridades hayan descuidado la vigilancia en las costas dominicanas
2126622 esto no es ning n conflicto entre rusia y georgia es algo que rechazo categ ricamente
2126623 all i can remember is lining up with my bag in one hand and my chain saw in the other
2126624 i had flashes of rotors hitting trees and we started to go down
2126625 they are heroes these guys were all my brothers i wish they were here with me
2126626 our family was here for almost 40 years and my grandfather has asked his inheritors to return here one day
2126627 i hope that in a few years time szczawnica will flourish and will return to its most glorious form
2126628 this is a great chance for the resort which was falling into disrepair and stagnation
2126629 the reconstruction by the inheritors is a chance to turn it back into a jewel
2126630 you can come here to repair your health and link that with an active vacation
2126631 its the third time we are here and we feel the treatment and the clean air really help
2126632 and its so peaceful here away from the big world
2126633 look dont get me wrong i really enjoyed it all last night it was fun but
2126634 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
2126635 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
2126636 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
2126637 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2126638 in 2003 a parking adjudicator told the council that we should make changes to the yellow lines and the enforcement in this area of montague hill south and allow some appeals against parking tickets
2126639 at the time she said the yellow lines were misleading and we shouldnt be enforcing
2126640 the well dressed man told toms wife that he knew where her son lived what line of work he was in and how many children he had
2126641 this is a very important step to improve relationships between the zoo and the people of iraq and it is proof that the security situation in iraq is getting better
2126642 theyre a real signature species people really identify with the beauty of the tigers
2126643 the zoo has been a real gem for the people here in iraq and the tigers will really add to that
2126644 the zoos a vibrant part of the economic and social revitalization of baghdad supporting this project fits these goals
2126645 its a nice place where kids can go its safe
2126646 in my professional opinion theyre very capable to be able to handle these cats
2126647 to me those tigers are almost like a symbol of power and pride and its good to restore them back to the zoo
2126648 i dont anticipate any problems for the tigers being there considering the zoos ability to handle them both humanely and properly
2126649 hi do you want my ticket its a daily zone 1 2 i dont need it anymore and its still valid
2126650 are you sure really i was waiting for it to be 6pm so that i can just get a 2 hour to travel are you really really really really sure
2126651 yes im about 10 minutes of walking from home i wont be going anywhere this evening and theres no point letting this go to waste
2126652 oh youre such a darling thank you so so so so much i hope all good things come your way

2126670 its not that the guy has said that its just that i was friends with him when his father went through it and although hes never said anything like that ive concluded it myself that the heart patient thing might be an issue
2126671 like your taste is like so uncool and im like so totally rad
2126672 i just filled up my gas tank at arnies gas bar and i cant pay for it the pump shows i owe 34 750 for petes sake i need you to sell my ranch house pronto
2126673 the price of gas in this town is just nuts
2126674 arnie says he had to increase it to 999 a gallon at the exact moment he saw me drivin into his station because those guys in iran have been makin threats and the stability of the worlds oil supply is all out of whack
2126675 i dunno about that but thank god carla was able to get 35 000 for my house she dropped her real estate fee to 250 so i came out all even after i paid her and then paid arnie what i owed him for the gas
2126676 its a funny coincidence because arnie ended up buyin my place to get me off the hook and today he announced that him and carla are gettin engaged and theyre gonna move in together at my old place
2126677 its a real nice house i had it appraised last year for 625 000 but i guess the price of real estate must be fallin just as fast as the price of gas is goin up the damn iranians its gotta be
2126678 looks like carla and arnie are all set though they got my house and arnie basically paid for it using the money i gave him to pay for the gas fill up
2126679 so they should be all right me i got no house now and i used up that whole tank of gas drivin around lookin for a nice wedding present for them
2126680 i couldnt find anythin especially good so i decided to give them one of my rooster weather vanes installation included on top of my old house so i guess i pretty much wasted the 34 750 tank of gas i used up
2126681 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business

2126697 they wont talk to us we dont know what a planning inquiry on this is going to achieve when the environment agency are the only ones blocking us
2126698 we are disappointed with the comments made by mr dyson following the decision by the government to call in the planning application for the south quays development particularly since this is an integral part of the democratic process
2126699 the agency has been working with mr dysons agents for more than two years and have had numerous face to face meetings
2126700 the south quays site falls within an area with the highest risk of flooding the flood risk is predicted to increase in the future due to the effects of climate change

2126757 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2126758 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2126759 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2126760 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2126761 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2126762 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power

2126886 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
2126887 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
2126888 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
2126889 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
2126890 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
2126891 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
2126892 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

2126940 this is a historical moment for us when we have been able to bring together speakers from diverse backgrounds together on a common platform to talk about the transformational impact of guru granth sahib and how it changed the society and revolutionized the thinking of masses
2126941 we sikhs still have a great task ahead of us to create an awareness about the spiritual wisdom in guru granth sahib
2126942 many in india still do not know that this great treasure contains the writings of maharasthraian saint namdev jaidev from bengal farid from pakpatan pakistan famous mystic kabir of benaras and 15 other holy souls of south asia it is our moral responsibility to pass on this gift to all
2126943 in the beginning of time god created the wonders of the world
2126944 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2126945 what we are witnessing today in china is a persistent and pervasive assault on human rights a betrayal of the olympic charter the modern olympic movement and chinas pledge to respect both
2126946 china undertook in their words to respect human rights to respect media freedom and then they added we will translate these words into deeds
2126947 it concludes both with the need to hold china to account to end the culture of impunity and to secure the promises that china originally gave that it would have press freedom and advance the cause of human rights
2126948 there is an inter relationship between trade and human rights and we cannot proceed in terms of business as usual
2126949 if we all act together canada with all the trading partners of china doing the same thing for example not allow fraudulently made goods or counterfeit goods to come to any of our countries i think we will be a lot more effective
2126950 we cant just be sending trade missions we should be sending human rights missions to china as well
2126951 its been close to my heart to try to help all the oppressed in the world
2126952 we decided to organize an event here in our capital to show canadian peoples solidarity for the people of china simultaneously around the world other groups are gathering at various chinese embassies and other meeting points
2126953 unlike other protests this is a protest that is bringing diverse groups together to speak with one single voice
2126954 our journalists are finally seeing just how restrictive the satellites are this will get our journalists to spread the message and put more pressure on the chinese government to make change
2126955 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopts from overseas but thats not what i found
2126956 more women get custody of children in divorce cases so after a divorce the mom is living with her kids and she meets a man and they get married and he adopts her children
2126957 this is the very first national data weve had on mens lifetime adoption experiences

2126972 it looks like an articulated tractor crossed the central reservation and hit one of the buses
2126973 one young person suffering from shock remains in hospital but her injuries are not life threatening she is under observation
2126974 weve spoken to all the parents of the children involved and appraised them of whats going on
2126975 we have a system whereby as soon as an incident like this occurs we have a team dedicated to speak to mums and dads which is what theyve been doing all last night and its still going on now
2126976 all of the young people who wanted the opportunity to call home would have got it last night
2126977 it appears that the tractor trailer collided with the bus
2126978 they were both pushed on to one side of the road and the bus then partially flipped over and ended up in a ditch
2126979 it was lucky really because it happened only 200 metres from a community centre a lot more people could have been hurt
2126980 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives

2126987 grave concern and it will certainly lead to retaliatory actions
2126988 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2126989 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2126990 at the end of the day the georgians realise that time is not on their side and they could not let south ossetia and abkhazia become even more messy and russian influence even stronger
2126991 he has had plenty of warnings from the west that it wont pull any chestnuts out of the fire for him so i dont think he can count on the cavalry riding in
2126992 the russians hope he will get more than verbal support
2126993 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction
2126994 ultimately his nato ambitions could go out of the window

2127002 judges can be made to handle the whole case so those involved dont even have to go to court
2127003 after the petition is lodged all negotiations can take place behind the scenes and the settlement will never be announced in open court it usually suits both sides to work that way often a celebrity will have a pre marital agreement that guarantees the spouse far less than he or she would normally be entitled to but if they agree to keep quiet they can profit financially from the deal its a useful bargaining chip

2127141 abandoned shopping carts are eyesores that denigrate community pride and pose extreme danger when left on public streets and sidewalks
2127142 i dont think any police officer would ever ever write a ticket for somebody taking a cart

2127157 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
2127158 working with our colleagues at the universit de montr al we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
2127159 we believe that this improvement may represent a significant step forward
2127160 the fact that we can stimulate a specific long term immune response gives us great hope that with additional development we will be able to give people infected with hiv a new option to battle the virus
2127161 the co transfection of monocyte derived dendritic cells dc by different combinations of hiv antigen rna and molecular adjuvant rna enhanced the response of hiv specific cd8 t cells

2127168 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2127169 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2127170 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2127171 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2127172 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2127173 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2127174 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2127175 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense

2127217 hes in custody and will be remanded for seven days depending on whether he contests his removal
2127218 this guy is a big deal he is on italian authorities most wanted list he came into canada under an assumed identity likely using fake documents
2127219 this arrest protects the integrity of our immigration program and reinforces the security of canada
2127220 canada is not a safe haven for individuals who gained admission to canada by hiding the fact that they are wanted by a foreign authority in relation to a criminal offence
2127221 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2127222 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2127223 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2127224 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2127225 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2127226 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2127227 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2127228 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2127229 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful

2127231 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2127232 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2127233 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2127234 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2127235 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2127236 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2127237 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2127238 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2127239 raymond is so nonpolitical he didnt even realize it it all comes down to one letter in a name it would have been a natural mistake for him to have made

2127244 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2127245 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2127246 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2127247 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2127248 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2127249 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2127250 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2127251 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2127252 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged

2127266 libraries of the future are becoming magnets for community activity gathering places of collaborative learning
2127267 we were flabbergasted that someone with his credentials experience background and accomplishments would even consider helping out a small suburban library like ours
2127268 everythings going along just great so far hes pretty much got his arms around everything and the staff loves him
2127269 he has a deep skill set that will help take the library to the next level
2127270 its been nearly 40 years since i worked in a little library
2127271 im spoiled in that im used to having an administrative staff
2127272 my wife has a long to do list of projects

2127275 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2127276 what ultimately happened in spite of the system was justice
2127277 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2127278 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2127279 asking for 30 years to life not only was ill advised and wholly inappropriate but was also soundly rejected by the panel
2127280 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2127281 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2127282 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2127283 so any notice given by them for president musharrafs impeachment can be challenged in the supreme court
2127284 there is no doubt he will fight back but given the odds against him and the unity shown by his political opponents inside and outside parliament he would be well advised to decide to bow out gracefully
2127285 if the president does not get the vote of confidence then immediately with it impeachment proceedings will start
2127286 it is the responsibility of pakistanis leaders to decide on a way forward to succeed as a modern and democratic country
2127287 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful

2127289 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2127290 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2127291 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2127292 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2127293 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2127294 im not making any predictions about medal counts but i can tell you the u s athletes are ready to come and compete in the spirit of friendship
2127295 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2127296 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2127297 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2127298 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2127299 i dont have any tickets to olympics events but my family and i will watch them on tv we are looking forward to watching the sports that china will excel at like ping pong and badminton
2127300 these types of things happened only once in a thousand years
2127301 ive even bought a small television so i can watch all these football matches in my shop
2127302 we will go home tonight to watch the opening ceremony together because we dont want to run into crowds outside
2127303 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
2127304 i want to say something international olympic committee president jacques rogge has said the games will bring fundamental changes to china i will reserve my opinions on that
2127305 i believe that eight is a good luck number but today is 88 days since the wenchuan earthquake so i have my doubts

2127307 but he has really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively
2127308 we have an understanding were going to talk at end of season
2127309 cito has created a great buzz with the team on and off the field
2127310 the players obviously love him im pretty positive about things i like what i have seen so far
2127311 hopefully in three or four days i can tell a difference and then be able to start running in a week or so im acting like it will be two weeks because i want to get back out there as soon as possible
2127312 if i knew i was going to hurt my knee i would have gone around him or run him over
2127313 the ball arrived in enough time to where i could have let him tag me
2127314 it was not like i really had a chance to be safe but in split second situations like that you do not really have time to decide
2127315 just even in the bullpen when i was locating my fastball the other day a lot of confidence shot through me
2127316 ive got to try to become a first baseman and thats a little harder to do with a catchers glove than a first basemans glove
2127317 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of the race thats the team attitude
2127318 im going to go up there and show them what i can do and hopefully i can stay
2127319 better teams are playing each other right now and we go to detroit on monday and then we play the teams ahead of us
2127320 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of it right now

2127324 we thought we were closer together in terms of a solution than we are
2127325 obviously we have reached an impasse but it is only as impasse
2127326 i think there is a spirit and an intention on all sides to resolve this
2127327 until the situation is resolved and our grievances are addressed
2127328 we are the poor relations of europe and after four years of delays the irish fa has to deal with this and deal with it today
2127329 outside of the welsh we are the worst paid and worst looked after referees across europe and that includes belarus and albania
2127330 we are looking at the more fundamental role of referees in the local game and the respect in which they are held
2127331 there is a serious problem in refereeing and it has been ignored for too long

2127334 its unfortunate that the bears are resorting to that coming into our area
2127335 because of the aggressive behaviour displayed by the bear by entering a house a shot was taken from the coquitlam rcmp
2127336 when a bear enters a residence its elevated its behaviour and it will continue to do that so it poses a significant risk to human safety
2127337 biologically their alarm is ringing saying winter is coming you better hurry and so they become much more active in search of food this time of year theyll spend as much as 20 hours a day
2127338 just about every town in the province now has problems weve had just a surge of bears entering the general population so that is a widespread problem now

2127355 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2127356 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2127357 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2127358 science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind
2127359 everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly superior to that of man and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humbled
2127360 life is a transcendental entity and is a part and parcel of the supreme lord and is eternal

2127363 but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2127364 i commend the police on their ingenuity but this simply demonstrates that the law is an ass and needs to be addressed
2127365 it should be embarrassing for us that the brits are having a laugh at our expense this joke of a situation is being reported in britain by the bbc the telegraph to name a few
2127366 i think that any future victims of this crook would have cause to be very very angry
2127367 an exercise in absurdity made necessary by a daft law

2127412 one chrestos causing himself to go down into the pit of scorpio or incarnation in the womb for the salvation of the world this was the sun shorn of his
2127413 is simple enough when it is considered that the names and apollonius or apollo are alike names of the sun in the heavens and necessarily the history of the one as to his travels through the signs with the personifications of his sufferings triumphs and miracles could be but the history of the other where there was a wide spread common method of describing those travels by personification

2127477 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2127478 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now

2127482 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2127483 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2127484 this goes to show the people of japan and the government of japan that they can be reassured that the will be forthright in disclosing details about any inadvertent release of radioactivity even when it is extremely small
2127485 first i want to say how great the choreography is
2127486 a major disruption to transnational organised crime both in this country and abroad

2127491 we still support the process of prosecution through serious crime unit investigation

2127494 the united states assures strict procedures and prevention systems for nuclear powered warships coming into port and japan is also checking the radiation levels 24 hours a day
2127495 we think we have a very good system in place to guard against cross contamination
2127496 but we have opted to re examine all these cases because we believe it is absolutely important to guarantee to the best of our ability the reliability of this evidence
2127497 in one case we found a flaw in the system that weve now changed but weve got no reason to believe that the system hasnt worked in all these other cases but were going back to review that
2127498 can we go out and play to win the game if its silky soccer great

2127574 he is our lord and god what he deserves is our love a love that is expressed in our worship in our service to others and in our obedience to the church
2127575 the kind of radical love expressed in obedience an obedience that can make our hearts ache and bruise our vanity is the seed of renewal in every age of the church
2127576 i entered religious life because i wanted to be one of those seeds because i knew my own happiness depended on it i am sure you want to be those seeds of renewal too
2127577 everything the catholic church offers in the way of its sacramental rituals and moral and doctrinal teachings is an obstacle to having a relationship with god
2127578 getting women religious to follow the lead of progressive theologians in renewing themselves into virtual oblivion
2127579 many of the active remnant are among the most aggressively disaffected groups in the church and some publicly declare that the vocation of their community is to go out of business
2127580 the church belongs to christ the church is his spouse and we find his peace through love and obedience to his church which is finally not an institution or corporation or bureaucracy but our mother and teacher
2127581 a difficult crisis due to the aging of members a more or less accentuated fall in vocations and sometimes a spiritual and charismatic weariness
2127582 harry has a wonderful intellect for the game his only fault is that he expects grown men to behave like grown men and not like babies

2127586 this ones for you mom i bring annihilation and cheap beer
2127587 i believe what jeff does is very unique and i believe participants are in for a real eye opening experience
2127588 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2127589 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2127590 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team we were not going to release him nor trade him to a team within the division when brett ultimately decided that he still wanted to play football but not in green bay we told him that we would work to find the best solution for all parties involved we wish brett and his family well
2127591 its a tough decision one i never thought i would have to make but i am excited about the opportunity
2127592 ive always felt throughout my career that when im on the field i give us a better edge i think any good player any good competitor should feel that way its not being cocky its being confident
2127593 god only knows the one thing that i know is that when i play i play 100 percent it may be ugly it may not be pretty but i give it everything ive got
2127594 we got to a spot where we felt comfortable with things
2127595 really we had a cursory monitoring situation going on we just kind of put an oar in the water
2127596 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2127597 mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process
2127598 a lot of people come across on little things and they learn more and more and more and then before you know it they are seeing green traits in products
2127599 it could be something that they seek out because its less toxic its better for you it tastes better or the quality tends to be better
2127600 they will dispose of it for you in an environmentally responsible way so by being green you are actually making money
2127601 you could save like 58 on a mac upgrade so you are actually making unexpected money
2127602 it can decrease your energy usage for light bulbs by nearly 75 percent
2127603 and if youre a little lazy like i am you never have to change them they never die i have light bulbs in my house that have been going for five years and i am used to pulling out my step ladder and changing bulbs but i havent had to do that for a very long time so they save you a lot of money over time
2127604 home electronics use a vast majority of power when they are turned off you have to unplug them because they kind of sip off the energy grid the whole time
2127605 and youre paying for that so if you go around unplugging things it can have a big impact on your utility bill
2127606 its a good idea to go low flow because particularly in the shower you are using water that gets heated by your heating system and youre paying for that twice
2127607 something thats a lot cheaper in the long run is to buy a reusable cloth like buy skoy clothes for 4 and reuse them as you clean the house
2127608 the payback for that is about three years sometimes four years
2127609 the life of the window film is around 15 years so you get 11 years of cost savings
2127610 you can get government tax discounts when you make home improvements that save you energy like new windows and doors
2127611 a no person shall carry or possess a firearm or other deadly weapon whether carried openly or concealed on any public property or in any building owned leased or under the care custody or control of the city of martinsburg
2127612 panasonics toughbook cf 29 comes closer to an indestructible notebook than anything weve seen
2127613 i hope we can hit the ground running if i knew that we could id sleep well tonight
2127614 you hope that we take everything on board that weve tried to do and it comes right for saturday
2127615 i know what my teams going to be for tomorrow you never say never but ive got a fair idea of what im going to go with
2127616 the aldershot team has changed a lot from the last time we played them
2127617 theyll be coming here full of confidence and it will be a good test for us but every team we play weve got to play them at some time so what we have to do is concern ourselves with how we approach the game and get it right and im sure we will
2127618 the excitements building now and i cant wait for it
2127619 home games on the first game of the season dont happen a lot the last time it did i think we won the league
2127620 you feel for the players and the fans and the management because a lot of thats out of their hands certainly the playing side of the management
2127621 but there are strict rules in place that have to be adhered to
2127622 the other people you feel sorry for when any business goes into administration are the people who dont get paid what theyre owed
2127623 moneys been tight at our place but we havent gone into administration so we havent written any debts off that consequently means you dont spend as much on the playing side as what youd like to
2127624 we had a document through the other week and i think over 50 clubs who have been the football league have been in administration at some time which is a lot of clubs
2127625 so maybe the ones who are at the back end of it now taking points deductions probably feel aggrieved because people have got away with it in the past
2127626 but i think the people who make decisions have decided that the only way to really clamp down on it is to take points off teams
2127627 i know if it was my situation id be licking my wounds now
2127628 they are big clubs and i think theyre capable of overcoming any points deduction
2127629 you feel lucky in the sense that as a club weve grown maybe a bit too quickly for our own liking but weve got a chairman who works really hard to try to balance the books and wont over commit himself
2127630 bes will go on loan to rosenborg until december 31 this will enable him to get match games which are vital for his rehabilitation
2127631 he has been out for a year and is not quite ready to start in our team just now but if he goes there he will hopefully come back on january 1 as a new player and ready to play a part for burnley football club
2127632 bes desperately needs games and this serves a purpose because with all due respect to the reserve league that will not allow him to get back to the level he was at before
2127633 as i said hes been out for a year exactly and this gives him the opportunity to play at a good level by playing week in week out and hopefully we will get a better player as a result
2127634 hes someone i always looked at when i was younger
2127635 when the premiership wonder years were on tele vision robbie fowler would always be on there with alan shearer and andy cole
2127636 theyve been the main three in the premiership robbies been part of that hes a great finisher with a great footballing mind and ill learn a lot from him
2127637 hes got great awareness in and around the box and if i can pick something like that up from him that would be fantastic it would help improve my game
2127638 i was up and running after two weeks working with the physios at brockhall
2127639 i enjoyed a good break as well which we all needed because we only had five days break last summer
2127640 ive also enjoyed spending time with the kids its been fantastic theyre quite hard work but theyre worth it
2127641 johns a good player and he will give us some experience in the middle of the park
2127642 hes keen to put his injuries behind him and do well for us now
2127643 ill be honest i was very jealous of hereford last season they came up as sort of the poorer partners to us on our coat tails and theyve gone past us now
2127644 id be lying if said i was happy when they went up last season i want a bit of what theyve tasted i watched a couple of league one games last season and it looks like a great league to play in
2127645 they play a little bit more football and thats certainly where im aiming and thats where the squad has to be aiming too
2127646 just to get to november will be a bonus when november comes around ill be wrapping myself up in cotton wool it seems to be a bogey month for me so if i can get through november ill be happy
2127647 but hopefully thats water under the bridge and we can keep as many players as we can fit next season
2127648 watching football in general when youre injured is a nightmare especially when your team isnt doing too well and you feel that you could help them
2127649 im due for a change in luck and hopefully this will be the season i can play the majority of the games
2127650 this year it all has to be about getting into the top half of the table last year we said we wanted to get into the play offs this year maybe we should be quiet about it and just set out sights on top half and see where it takes us
2127651 if you look back over the last two season it hasnt been good enough so the changes the gaffer made were necessary
2127652 the gaffer cut a lot of players from the squad but it had to be done a few people were a little bit comfortable and two seasons of fighting relegation in my book isnt good enough after all the success weve had here
2127653 hopefully the players that have come in will come in with the attitude of wanting to get promotion
2127654 weve got the nucleus of a strong squad and if we can bring just a couple more in then the quality is there to push further up the league
2127655 we just need that little bit of luck which we had when we won the conference and we havent had a large portion of in the last two seasons if we get that and people re create the form they showed in that season we can push up to the higher levels of this league
2127656 some of the people who come in are not used to the traditions of the club people like myself paul mullin and robbie williams have been here a long time and its important that the people who come in know how important the club is to the people of accrington
2127657 it was shattering news when the doctor sat on the end of the bed and told me what hed found but its something that has happened to others and i have got to be positive
2127658 it has all happened so quickly no one had an inkling about it at all because his body has been well and he is well in himself
2127659 when i was in leeds infirmary i heard a guy in the bed opposite talking to someone about burnley who was saying the fans are crackers and i thought i should be the one saying that after what we put them through in the dark days the loyalty they showed was unbelievable
2127660 when we went to wembley it was a fantastic day but i always seem to remember coming home and getting off the bus at the wagon and horses pub to change onto the open top one
2127661 it started to pour down and i thought there was going to be no one there to meet us but when we came down the hill it was just like a sea of claret and blue
2127662 there were people hanging off balconies and on the top of buildings it was amazing and i was gobsmacked
2127663 all at burnley football club are sorry to hear about rays illness
2127664 playing liverpool at anfield in the champions league it doesnt get any bigger it was amazing
2127665 it was the draw everyone at tns wanted especially as liverpool had just won the champions league in istanbul we were all made up
2127666 anfield was packed to the rafters all their fans turned out because it was their first home game since winning it and they wanted to celebrate all over again
2127667 liverpool put out their first team they wanted to see us off so they could put their feet up and relax for the second leg
2127668 they had everyone playing reina carragher gerrard hyypia it was a great side with great players
2127669 i was marking darren potter at left back after being run ragged for 70 minutes they then decided to bring djibril ciss on hes rapid but it was a great challenge
2127670 i cant ever knock the european experience i had playing for tns that part of it was fantastic
2127671 getting into europe with a chance for big nights against liverpool and man city was a such a huge reward especially with the teams you could get
2127672 you always want the big games they are the games you play for in your life and we went all over europe
2127673 id also played in places like sweden and latvia and we were coming up against good teams
2127674 last season we went out on away goal to ventspils of latvia that was the closest we came for a while to progressing through the champions league
2127675 obviously the english football league is a better standard than the welsh premier league youre coming up against better teams week in week out
2127676 in england you are playing at a higher tempo and itll be good to play in front of bigger crowds im really looking forward to that side of it
2127677 looking at the fixture list i cant wait for the carling cup tie at wolves thats a great draw for us so early in the season
2127678 but my dad never pushed me down that path i was just always aware that i wanted to be a footballer
2127679 hitting the back of the net there wont be a sweeter sound in football to be honest
2127680 to start off scoring a few is good but realistically i have to do a lot more of that during the season
2127681 if i can keep that ratio up i should be okay but id like to score in as many games as i can
2127682 goals come in runs if you can get scoring and keep the run going its just good for confidence
2127683 its a strong squad and if other people come in its going to step up another level and thats great for us
2127684 its good that weve all scored especially for jay rodriguez and macca alex macdonald
2127685 its important to get the young lads scoring to give them confidence because youll need them to come on at some stage and save you a couple of points
2127686 the gaffers staking a bit of a claim to play at the start of the season with his toe bungs
2127687 im loathe to say it but he has still got it
2127688 one of the reasons for bringing in martin paterson is that i think he can get better and he can get better with us
2127689 there are things we can work on we know that
2127690 i dont lie im not the greatest of players in the world but if you havent got the greatest ability you have to work hard and thats one thing i guarantee hard work
2127691 we found out last season that this is a hard league
2127692 the lads who have been here for a while have done an excellent job
2127693 but i want to take this football club to the next level and that means freshening things up
2127694 it is a tough start with wycombe and then forest away in the carling cup but that is where the extra experience comes in
2127695 i think im clear in my mind at the moment what the side will be although things could change
2127696 we have an idea of how were going to shape up but even when thats done there will be a few disappointed players and rightly so
2127697 they have acquitted themselves ever so well in pre season in terms of their physical condition and equally their technical play but the nature of the game is that you can obviously only pick any given 11 or 16 for any particular match
2127698 so the hardest part will be disappointing some players theres no doubt
2127699 pre season was the easy part because we had nine games and we wanted each player to have at least five 90 minutes or the equivalent under their belt
2127700 so people will be disappointed but i always ask them to use that as a positive to make sure when they do get an opportunity then they take it to stay in the team
2127701 if they dont react like that they will be poorer for it because they wont get back in
2127702 as footballers you train all week with the games at the weekend or whatever and if you dont react positively youre only letting yourself down
2127703 i will only pick players i feel are up for the challenge that we have at burnley football club and want to be a part of it
2127704 each and every one of them have been a credit to themselves and that will continue
2127705 they know we can only pick 11 so its up to them to make sure they are the ones in our mind
2127706 whether its systems or whatever there will be times when people are left out but we play 46 league games plus cup competitions and its rare people play in every game
2127707 i think its a toss up for every position we want that competition for places
2127708 i think those that are lucky enough to play on saturday realise they have to perform and do what theyre good at to stay in the team
2127709 it can only mean that youre going to play better otherwise youre going to fall short of the mark so hopefully that will bring out the best in everybody
2127710 remcos been fantastic we love playing with him because he gives us that screen hes good in the air and when its a flat ball into a striker he can be in the front there hes going to be important to us
2127711 i think every midfielder weve got is going to be important because its hard to stay fresh week in week out for those guys up and down running miles every single game
2127712 remco will be crucial as well as the rest of the guys
2127713 its a lot tougher to keep clean sheets if youve got a flamboyant team and a team that likes to go forward
2127714 personally id rather play in a team like that because its exciting and its what the fans want to see its great its just trying to get that blend
2127715 if you look at most teams who are successful in any league they concede the fewest goals were hoping to keep clean sheets but its a collective effort its not just about defenders
2127716 i dont take individual praise if we keep a clean sheet its a team effort we have to have the right kind of shape as a team to get clean sheets and it makes our job easier if we have that
2127717 no im at a ghetto liquor store i was on my way to pick up stretch at the water park and decided that i needed wine so i pulled over at some liquor store off of baker
2127718 ill give you sixty to come home with me right now
2127719 if i did have a type and i dont skinny boys with dark hair five oclock shadow glasses and big dicks would definitely be in the running
2127720 gee that was some quality lovin i wonder if hes a prostitute
2127721 redundancy burns up fans interest and causes franchises to fail
2127722 done and handled is not taught in any b school not even in the best ones like iims i cant comment about harvard stanford etc
2127723 he that believeth and is baptised shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
2127724 became one with the gods through an interflow of a common life in the common blood of the two
2127725 th e lord of creatures offered himself a sacrifice for the gods
2127726 he who knowing this sacrifices with the purusha madha or the sacrifice of the primeval male be comes everything
2127727 the father of the sacred fire in india bore the name of
2127728 st barnabas the companion of st paul in his epistle ch ix discovers the name of jesus crucified in the number 318
2127729 but this is but a play upon the hebrew letters jodh chith and shin from whence the ihs as the monogram of christ coming down to our day and this reads as or 381 and sum of the letters being 318 or the number of abraham and his satan and of joshua and his amalek also the number of jacob and his antagonist godfrey higgins gives the authority for the number 608 it is the number of melchizedeks name for the value of the last is 304 and melchizedek was the priest of the most high god without beginning nor ending of days
2127730 in the ancient pantheons the two planets which had existed from eternity onic eternity and were eternal were the sun and the moon or osiris and isis hence the terms of without beginning nor ending of days 304 multiplied by two is 608 so also the numbers in the word seth who was a type of the year there are a number of authorities for the number 888 as applying to the name of jesus christ and as said this is in antagonism to the 666 of the anti christ the staple value in the name of joshua was the number 365 the indication of the solar year while jehovah delighted in being the indication of the lunar year and jesus christ was both joshua and jehovah in the christian pantheon
2127731 the most cultured the most learned and most wealthy of the christian name
2127732 the ears of the church properly refused to listen to it
2127733 it appears evident to us that the author made use of ancient documents and among these of certain midraschim or collections of traditions and biblical expositions which we do not now possess
2127734 haya gaon who died in 1038 is to our knowledge the first author who developed the theory of the sephiroth and he gave to them the names which we find again to be among the kabalists tellenik moses ben schem tob di leon p 13 note 5 this doctor who had intimate intercourse with the syrian and chaldean christian savans was enabled by these last to acquire a knowledge of some of the gnostic writings
2127735 the claim of christianity to possess divine authority rests on the ignorant belief that the mystical christ could and did become a person whereas the gnosis proves the corporeal christ to be only a counterfeit presentment of the trans corporeal man consequently historical portraiture is and ever must be a fatal mode of falsifying and discrediting the spiritual reality
2127736 shall you who in the beginning looked to the christ spirit now end by believing in a christ of flesh
2127737 your craving is causing me to suffer there fore i need to jihad against you
2127738 my own craving caused stress and so i pulled out that craving
2127739 stay away from andy a little bit of fun is not worth this

2127742 headship in marriage does not mean that women submit to men it means one woman submits to one man her submission to her husband protects her from having to submit to other men prior to marriage her submission to her father protects her from having to submit to other men there is no overall biblical requirement that women be submissive to men in general the biblical pattern is that a wife should respond to the initiative and leadership of her husband and only to him she is prepared and trained for this in her submission to her father
2127743 its good to start at home to a side who were disappointed at the death of last season
2127744 things are going well were progressing well and had a great trip to america
2127745 i think its one of the best places to go for pre season its fantastic
2127746 its good socialising with regards to shopping and a couple of nights out and these kind of things and i think thats so important in pre season were already a close squad but we seem to have got even closer for that
2127747 i think those are the sort of plus points of going to america also you get the tough training in the heat and you get really difficult games against fit lads
2127748 it reminds me a lot of when i was at sunderland we had a fantastic spirit there and we had been to america that year as well i feel like weve got the same kind of spirit and hopefully were going to get the same results as we had then
2127749 i definitely know that ive worked hard this summer probably harder than i usually work
2127750 i think all the lads came back so fit from the holidays that im sure sandy stewart the gaffer and skip steve davis will be the first to say it was easy really to train us
2127751 we did some hard runs but the lads were flying and we could progress so much quicker
2127752 and playing games is the only way to get your sharpness and timing
2127753 plus weve got a great mix in our squad as well with five or six younger lads and the majority of the others are 27 to 30 which is a great age to be in and weve got a few of the older lads who have got the complete experience and definitely the respect of the whole squad
2127754 a mix is so important too many young lads isnt great and too many older lads isnt great but weve just got a fantastic mix
2127755 that squad is so important but they need to have a focus and togetherness for players to stay fit if youre out of the team you work harder you get in and you do your absolute upmost to keep your place
2127756 i think weve got the kind of lads that know that and will do that
2127757 because we were reasonably successful last year without playing to our maximum we feel that we have to take that on
2127758 its going to be more difficult this season because teams have spent a bit of money and theyre strengthening
2127759 we ended up consolidating last year when we probably had high hopes for a bit more allied with quarter finals of the fa cup we took it
2127760 we feel that weve added quality in the areas we needed to strengthen
2127761 darryl duffy and jeff hughes have made an impact and they should be big players for us
2127762 the players that were here last season have made progress with their fitness and techniques
2127763 to be honest i havent succeeded in dealing with that yet
2127764 being knocked out of the tournament in the quarter finals proved to be very painful
2127765 expectations ran sky high after we had emphatically beaten the world champions italy and the vice world champions france and it was not only the fans that had high expectations the squad was also brimming with confidence and looking forward to reaching the next stage
2127766 it was too bad we were knocked out by the russians
2127767 i realise i am 34 now and it may be different for a 20 year old player who has a long career ahead of him
2127768 but this may very well have been the last opportunity for me to win a major trophy
2127769 i think the chances i will ever lift the champions league trophy with rovers are very slim
2127770 last season i was dropped to the bench for the last five games and i was not amused
2127771 paul ince is at the helm now and he has promised each player will be given a fair chance so we all start afresh
2127772 i have no idea how things will eventually develop but he will undoubtedly inform me if and how i will feature in his plans
2127773 its flattering to be linked with other clubs but i am enjoying life in lancashire and so are my family
2127774 we have a great squad here and the team spirit is wonderful
2127775 i have no intention of calling time on my career
2127776 the world cup in south africa will take place in two years i am still ambitious and feel fit so i dont feel like hanging up my boots yet

2127784 ultimately our members will decide if they want to take industrial action to try to correct some of the wrongs
2127785 we as an employer are obliged to review all of our staffs pay in relation to one another and we have to implement that with due consideration to equal pay for work of equal value
2127786 that has meant that some staff have gone up and some staff unfortunately have gone down
2127787 these are good staff that provide a very very good service to the people of bury and they have been very loyal to this council and the locality and my heart does go out to them

2127790 in purely statistical terms do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
2127791 the fact theres enough leadership on the team to recognize that things need to be addressed is a positive
2127792 these guys over the years have responded and i expect them to again

2127796 i was going to say hi and then say before we start id like to finish my goodbye from last time when you were leaving paris
2127797 im just not feeling really good referring to her throat
2127798 you know that i like and you feel for you but
2127799 after two years of full cooperation its unfortunate that the federal government waited until mr amodeo was admitted into a treatment program to indict him
2127800 nevertheless mr amodeo expects any resulting trial will reveal that this is simply a case of delayed tax payment and that the fraud charges are without merit independent polygraph testing confirmed this
2127801 at an optimal level for creating a favorable bankruptcy class
2127802 amodeo advised the presidion situation required that a decision had to be made on whom not to pay
2127803 amodeo stated it was clear that if all obligations were to be met that the workers compensation had to be paid immediately this would prevent immediate closure and subsequent damages
2127804 the idea was not to pay the payroll taxes until workers compensation was stabilized and also to prevent certain creditors and stakeholders from shutting down the business this was being done to permit the business to survive as a going concern
2127805 we sat down with mirabilis we shook hands on a deal
2127806 they financially qualified but within 48 hours we unraveled the deal
2127807 i wouldnt come in and try to air it out every pitch
2127808 i have to learn to pace myself again and be more in the strike zone usually i work on the corners now ive got to try to force contact a little more
2127809 to get three outs in one inning is not too much to ask of yourself
2127810 with the merger now completed were pleased with the integration of two strong teams and are focused on making progress in operating metrics
2127811 i am not saying i am a big mccain fan either
2127812 this presidential candidate appears to be nothing short of the president and the votes have not even been cast
2127813 when he said no she apologized and assured him that she would find him later
2127814 a prisoner held in derby crown court cells died yesterday in circumstances described by the police as unexplained but not suspicious
2127815 because some of the bargain airlines are charging for overweight luggage we obviously need to make sure that the scales are weighing accurately and that theyre reading correctly
2127816 we immediately put procedures in place where my engineers test these on a daily basis to make sure this cant happen again
2127817 not only that but it is also having an affect on the appearance of the park
2127818 at least some of the businesses did not have permission to sell parking the car parks are only to be used by them and their customers during the working day
2127819 i dont think the council are doing it willy nilly and being killjoys
2127820 it can be difficult for our patients to get away on holiday
2127821 they have to book months and months in advance and sometimes they cant get to a hospital near where they are staying so we came up with this idea
2127822 we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers
2127823 some three weeks ago we secured an order from derby county court for their eviction
2127824 they the protesters asked for some time to leave the premises they havent carried out their promise to leave so weve had to enforce the eviction notice
2127825 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2127826 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2127827 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2127828 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2127829 if you report for work on or after 1 november 2008 not having accepted this offer of re engagement you will be asked to leave the premises as you will no longer be an employee of leeds city council
2127830 there was a right way to do this and a wrong way and this was the wrong way
2127831 we have written to all members of staff involved in the first phase of the pay and grading project offering them new terms of employment and the majority have replied to say they have accepted
2127832 however we are in the unfortunate position that for a very small number of staff who have not accepted this offer we have had to advise them of the need to begin dismissal and offer of immediate re engagement proceedings
2127833 this is regretful but it is now the only remaining method of implementing the national single status agreement that will ensure the councils pay structure complies with equal pay legislation
2127834 if its such earth shattering stuff whats been going on since 2005
2127835 why is he on the street if they think its that important
2127836 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2127837 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2127838 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person
2127839 usamriid is not like being in a shack in the wilderness its interacting with people in a pretty secure place
2127840 if i even suspected that he was anywhere close to being mental i would not have done the paperwork at all the state of maryland approved him
2127841 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
2127842 if we dont have a good handle on this at usamriid its probably true we dont have a good handle on it across the board
2127843 at that point the investigation still had a long way to go
2127844 i think what youre asking sir answers the question itself
2127845 he had been this way for a number of years going back for quite a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid
2127846 wed always hoped there would be more progress towards 100 completion by this stage but given that progress had stalled at 37 for some time to have achieved this has to be regarded as a measured success for local government
2127847 the dilemma that the judgement around pay protection brings us is that either we have to spend a great deal more money on the women bringing cases or we have to bring in pay and grading structures without pay protection and that risks industrial action you are damned if you do and damned if you dont it leaves councils with a very sombre risk assessment to make
2127848 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment
2127849 were tired of rising food and fuel prices so were going to turn this weed patch into a p patch an organic community garden

2127859 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2127860 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2127861 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2127862 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2127863 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2127864 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2127865 i cant say im overly experienced with doing such a big project with cake

2127867 shame on lor al for doing this i see no excuse for this if it was uneven skin tone then they just as easily could have made her a tone darker but they did not do that they made her white
2127868 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2127869 we know that this is fairly common practice but that doesnt make it excusable
2127870 this sort of thing creates a negative perception of african beauty
2127871 for all the talk of black is beautiful images like this clearly show that weve got a very long way to go yet
2127872 all i know is that beyonc looks remarkably beautiful on that we do not get involved in the colouring of adverts that appear in the magazine that is a matter for lor al
2127873 we believe any such modifications could suggest the view that black is not beautiful we believe that all people should be celebrated as they are

2127879 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
2127880 i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost or without sacrifice or without the contribution of almost every american citizen
2127881 but i will say that these goals are possible and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century

2127889 now we got a nice quiet little division here and i aim to keep it nice and quiet so let me make something plain i dont like you sucking around bothering our citizens favre i dont like your jerk off name i dont like your jerk off face i dont like your jerk off behavior and i dont like you jerk off do i make myself clear
2127890 my stalker ex girfriend has been favreing me for months
2127891 knee is pulling a favre this afternoon its gonna rain
2127892 initial reaction is that these are better than expected with a lower loss and higher core tier 1 capital
2127893 unlike air france klm and lufthansa swiss there are few network overlaps and the networks are complementary ba offers iberia a strong global network to north america middle east and asia a large and loyal customer base and an entrenched position at london heathrow iberia offers ba the largest latin american network growth opportunities a strong balance sheet competitive cost base a strong management team and 120m of slots at heathrow
2127894 we estimate that combined revenue could be boosted 1 per cent and non fuel costs reduced by 3 5 per cent by 2015 we estimate total joint synergies of the order of 200 350m by 2012 and 500 700m by 2015 a potential joint venture with american airlines could boost revenue further from 2010 most cost synergies are likely to come from combining maintenance and back office activities
2127895 the environment for northern foods has toughened again recently as the consumer continues to weaken and cost inflation recovery becomes harder we have updated our numbers and now forecast reduced volumes in the chilled business 2 1 per cent a margin squeeze from continued cost inflation and the pension surplus of 66m eroding completely in 2009 resulting in a reduced level of profitability which we see as sustainable
2127896 we appreciate that the market will need to adjust to this lower level of profitability however even on this level of returns we believe the shares offer value to investors with a longer term perspective
2127897 like most people here we dont have tickets to the opening ceremonies

2127913 this loss is a consequence of previously signalled writedowns on credit market exposures amounting to 5 9 billion
2127914 in response to these new market conditions we moved decisively to strengthen our capital position materially
2127915 in so doing we are acutely aware that we drew heavily on our shareholders for financial support and we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations for the company and restores value to our shares we are determined to do so and this is our focus
2127916 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2127917 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns
2127918 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword and simply because the ceo sir fred goodwin removing him would be too disruptive to the organisation at this time and its just not responsible to do so
2127919 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
2127920 i think rbs is unique in one area in that they are very dependent on the investment banking industry whereas the other high street banks dont have that much of a reliance on it
2127921 we really have two issues at hand here we have a sub prime issue and rbs is still suffering from a sub prime issue
2127922 but we have a second issue which is more important we have a slowdown in the economy they are just simply not getting enough business coming in the front door to remain profitable

2127955 our 2008 outlook has turned decidedly more cautious in the past few months as the shock of high oil prices has affected both demand for our products and our costs

2127960 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
2127961 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief

2127976 there is welcome new disclosure but questions will remain about the adequacy of some of the marks barclays is operating at relatively low capital ratios expecting a core tier 1 ratio of around 5 7 per cent by the end of the year making it vulnerable to any further writedowns

2128023 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2128024 mcdonalds clearly continues to be one of the few consistent performers in a challenging consumer sector
2128025 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2128026 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2128027 this was a very good showing in the middle of an economic slowdown
2128028 recent legislation including the pension protection act and the supreme courts ruling that individuals can sue defined contribution plan sponsors who mismanage their funds has been a real wake up call for plan sponsors
2128029 in just one year were seeing a significant shift in the way defined contribution plans are managed
2128030 1 800 volunteers spent a week to demolish the house with the overflowing septic tank that belonged to milton and patricia harper of lake city ga
2128031 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
2128032 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2128033 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2128034 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2128035 the days in which the swiss banker would take your money and not ask questions are long gone
2128036 the summer spike in fuel and food prices is causing shoppers to pare back their plans for tax rebates and back to school spending
2128037 value and convenience retailers performed better in july than the industry as a whole as sales at discount stores wholesale clubs and drugstores led the industry
2128038 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
2128039 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2128040 having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the uk of passenger air transport services by british airways and virgin atlantic airways
2128041 any anti competitive behaviour is to be condemned at ba or at other companies

2128043 a discount to the price at which lonmin shares were trading as recently as 30 june 2008
2128044 shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in respect of the pre conditional offer and to reject the approach
2128045 we are sceptical of the lonmin deal and struggle to see why xstrata management did not go after freeport copper instead at 33 per share xstrata is acquiring lonmin for a 2009 price to earnings multiple of 16 5 times at 1 750 per ounce the deal is 2 per cent accretive to 2009 earnings the lonmin assets are tired in need of a significant management focus at a time when momentum in the platinum group metals markets is waning perhaps our scepticism will be proven wrong but for now we think the deal is likely to be a hard sell
2128046 we believe the bid will renew investor focus on potential merger amp acquisition activity in the sector given the de rating the sector has recently undergone during a time of record cash flows
2128047 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2128048 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2128049 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked

2128052 a military strike against irans nuclear facilities would probably only delay the countrys progress toward nuclear weapons capability according to a study that concludes that such an attack could backfire by strengthening tehrans resolve to acquire the bomb
2128053 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2128054 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2128055 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons

2128068 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2128069 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2128070 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2128071 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2128072 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
2128073 there is a fundamental rethink in the alignment between the major currencies with the u s dollar coming out on top despite ongoing turmoil in the financial sector
2128074 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2128075 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2128076 this was a very good showing in the middle of an economic slowdown
2128077 now lets be frank you and i both know that if you were so inclined you could probably use the internet to download amateur dramatics absolutely for free i am not suggesting that you would i am just acknowledging that the average minotaur shock fan is a person who is aware savvy and generally knows whats what
2128078 i dont make enough money out of music for it to be a career i have a day job i have a little family and a big mortgage hence its difficult for me to tour i couldnt afford to pay a band even if i wanted to this isnt a sob story mind its just a subtle way of guilting people into paying for the music
2128079 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales pc shipments and profits
2128080 the global spotlight is shining on lenovo our products and our people
2128081 were all hopeful that the market is going to continue to improve
2128082 were working diligently on taking down costs and cutting expenses
2128083 london was a catalyst for my band breaking up and relationships breaking up it destroys you or makes you better it seems like quite a while ago now
2128084 a lot of the time you dont realise how direct youre being i didnt think anyone would hear many of the songs they were therapy things you couldnt say to someones face but i look at that heartache as positive now because i did get a record out of it that is a bit harsh isnt it
2128085 i spent most of childhood on a beach called piha
2128086 very dramatic rocky sand dark but not in a sinister way right next to the beach where they shot the piano whenever i drive out there now theres something that happens when you reach the top of the hills and start descending down to the beach every anxiety and worry is left there and everything makes more sense
2128087 if youre going to work as hard as you can at something it may as well be where youre up against everyone
2128088 but it was humbling for my band who had been big for a long time at home you set yourself up for these hardships knowing theyre good for you then while its happening you think idiot what are you doing
2128089 every new zealander seems to go through that first year of completely losing themselves and questioning everything
2128090 londons a very intense place where you can have every experience under the sun and if you come out the other side youll be stronger london teaches you your boundaries but its not a place of much musical community its dog eat dog every man for himself the datsuns were the only band from home here then we didnt fit in with the bands we met
2128091 the reason why i well we decided to move to london was that i felt something wasnt quite right and maybe this will make it fresh again ill probably be that confused again but ill never dig myself a hole like that theyre still my best mates but my dream when i was 15 had become an uphill battle they didnt have their hearts in it i didnt realise how unhappy i was
2128092 she moved back to new zealand about the time it came out last year it might have been quite a harsh thing to go home to right when i was everywhere i dont think she should feel too upset by it when we were together she was always going why dont you write any songs about me just you wait
2128093 i can be intense and over thinking and anxious in private i guess everyones got their own little demons that they know about themselves but i am wide eyed about this musicians life i find it hard not to give 100 per cent to every experience
2128094 i dont realise how manic i can get after this long on tour whiskeys before the show start not to go down as easily what looks good on paper is not good for the soul were booked until christmas eight shows in a row then two off but i thrive on those endorphins theyre addictive when im not on the road about 10pm ive got energy i need to let out
2128095 their formula for me was a leprechaun plus elliott smith minus the despair but the despairs my favourite part of elliott smith so im elliott smith without the valid pain ive got to take up drugs and live harder
2128096 when i couldnt do an interview without seeing dads name i didnt want to fight it but its double edged no one sees how hard we worked not to pull strings in london that goes unnoticed it makes you think well ill use all the connections if im going to get the negativity for management and prs saying hey its neil finns son makes their job easier with betchadupa we werent accepted by the commercial or alternative worlds we were a really great band the people who heard us loved us i was putting my heart and soul into it but something wasnt right
2128097 it seemed normal to me because i dont know any different
2128098 but i didnt get to see friends very often i got used to saying goodbyes and not having roots im still doing that im most relaxed and happy when im constantly moving even being back in london i can feel the weight of slipping back into society
2128099 i definitely have a lot of guards up my excuse is that i dont live anywhere but im going to have to let go because its no fun i dont know how i feel
2128100 i want to feel things as intensely again as i did before ill be lightning that made it so genuine and intimate i need to get hurt again and make another record

2128107 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2128108 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2128109 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2128110 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer consumers dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2128111 for the manufacturers its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
2128112 despite a tough economy and weak auto sales gross additions set a new second quarter record
2128113 we also are very encouraged that the strength of our brands allowed us to offset the unprecedented levels of commodity and other input costs through pricing and helped deliver market share gains and increased operating margins
2128114 employers offer pay raises not to keep up with inflation but to attract talent and reward productivity
2128115 having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the u k of passenger air transport services by british airways and virgin atlantic airways
2128116 if the currency fluctuation doesnt go in its favor its going to be in even deeper trouble
2128117 toyota will continue to keep a close eye on the used car market and set suitable values in a timely manner
2128118 you dont want to assume that you cant influence your fate in a tough economy
2128119 always make it clear to your employer that your preference is them
2128120 often its the person who is the least costly to an employer who provides the same value as others whos going to be the last to go

2128124 eventually time runs out if you dont start winning games
2128125 we have to finish strong hopefully we can play better
2128126 with the ball rattling around in the corner i dont know of any third base coach who would have held him up there
2128127 you have to make the decision right away sometimes you make the right one sometimes you make the wrong one
2128128 midway in the air i figured i had a chance
2128129 you see what happens and then you just go hard it was a great feeling not starting the game and coming in for defensive purposes and making a great play
2128130 i was really impressed with him tonight because this place plays small and they have a lot of power
2128131 javy was the no 2 guy for us the way he pitched last year and the expectations are going to get higher and higher from now on for everyone
2128132 the american consumer is no more prone to save than the american marine is to retreat however with joblessness rising house prices falling gasoline prices orbiting and credit contracting even americas iron wallets must adapt hovering near the zero percent marker the savings rate has little farther to fall it takes no great predictive courage to suggest that it may begin to rise which we hereby do if the savings rate returned to just half its level in 1992 it would reach 3 9 of disposable income up from 0 6 at present disposable personal income is jogging along at the rate of 10 5 trillion a year an increase in savings of 3 3 percentage points would amount to 346 5 billion of deferred spending
2128133 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me
2128134 i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs im always celebrating everybodys elses at home plate and to get to be the one that jumps into the pile is pretty fun
2128135 and if it doesnt but we win the game what can you do its not like hes scuffling for a job or something
2128136 cable is taking share and it is taking it in gulps
2128137 the telcos wired businesses suddenly look not only like they are weakening they look like they are positively collapsing
2128138 mcdonalds clearly continues to be one of the few consistent performers in a challenging consumer sector
2128139 most challenging year to date with regard to efforts at the state level to restrict directory publishers ability to freely deliver phone books
2128140 the ones that get used will remain and the ones that dont will go away
2128141 the internet is the sexy new technology out there but it isnt where most of their money is coming from its coming from the mom and pop stores that want to be in that yellow pages book
2128142 if there are three publishers including a small independent that gets maybe 20 percent of the usage most businesses are going to want to have access to that 20 percent
2128143 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october
2128144 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2128145 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2128146 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2128147 but the results so far are better than we were expecting
2128148 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2128149 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2128150 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2128151 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2128152 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2128153 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2128154 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2128155 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2128156 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars

2128162 i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2128163 the telecommunications market in canada is dynamic choice is available
2128164 our position is it doesnt change the legal course of action weve taken in the courts
2128165 its a record for the second quarter 45 percent is unbelievably good
2128166 most of the text message traffic in the u s goes over tekelec equipment
2128167 tenants are holding onto space not moving or not making the decision whether to move
2128168 some of the speculative space could remain on the market for six to 12 months or longer
2128169 it threw enough cold water on the spec machine which was in high gear
2128170 i grew up seeing soundsystems at weddings parties and local government funded festivals
2128171 and my experience of dancehall came from soundtapes the recordings of reggae dances with mcs and deejays chatting over dub instrumentals were like golddust at school people traded the saxon soundsystem soundtapes round the playground
2128172 i started by rapping other peoples lyrics from the soundtapes we would take their lyrics and put our own little twist on them i did a few parties and tapes
2128173 between the ages of eight and 10 i was strictly into reggae and the first time i heard rapping was rappers delight that was a massive tune people used to sing it round school but it totally went past me to me it was soul talking a soul tune with people talking it wasnt until four years later and the film beat street that i got into rap and hip hop
2128174 viewing dancehall as separate from hip hop or as its often described a jamaican variant of hip hop is crazy as they all come from the same place in the long term which is african music
2128175 reggae caused the birth of hip hop as kool dj herc alleged inventor was jamaican and brought the soundsystem to the bronx
2128176 kool herc was jamaican he went to america with his sound dressed down his patois and flipped it into hip hop
2128177 unsung dancehall and reggae artists like the ragga twins and what they were doing with the unity soundsystem and papa levi and the saxon soundsystem in the 1980s were completely under the radar from london and the uk we wanted to highlight their influence on the here and now and try to understand english mcs in terms of their englishness and caribbean background
2128178 we made more money in the first six months on the rave scene than in the 15 years doing reggae
2128179 its always been topical smiley cultures cockney translation translated cockney for jamaicans and police officer was about being stopped and searched its the tradition of the african griot and the english town crier its the same thing storytelling a combination of stand up entertainment telling a joke telling a story motivating the crowd and getting a response
2128180 you get beautiful moments with grime mcs some of them dont even know where the culture comes from but its a beautiful thing how theyve taken it on and the influence is reaching from different generations and age groups and to people from different backgrounds not just jamaican kids
2128181 this was such an incredible process for me rockin with jack white is something that has been an unforgettable experience mixing rock and soul for the new bond movie theme gives it a mysterious unexpected strong and sexy vibe that i love im glad to be a part of such a legacy
2128182 whats the name of that band you listen to all the time
2128183 the one with the drummer named moon isnt it the whos
2128184 you have the keenest eye for observing human nature has anyone ever told you that
2128185 and then decide that what i needed most what would make me most delighted was a rager in the barn
2128186 i understand that perhaps the depth isnt there for every country but cycling is a team sport so each country should have equal representation whether its four three or just two riders
2128187 just like any other team sport if you win everyone deserves a medal
2128188 the olympics is looking for individual effort if theyre only going to award one medal road cycling isnt just an individual effort its a team sport
2128189 free confidential multilingual access to information about the full range of community social health and government services
2128190 a single phone number for non emergency municipal services and information and will be available 24 hours a day seven days a week in multiple languages
2128191 the rest of the stores are very solid right now
2128192 we thought we would get the volume there because of all the rooftops and the need for home improvement
2128193 with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
2128194 these are very small kids sometimes weighing less than a pound and a half on a ventilator sometimes with unstable blood pressure
2128195 i just know i had an agreement with a surgeon at one point in time and now i have to send them out
2128196 i suggest we welcome the competition rather than placing the upmc seal on an inferior product and actively facilitate the development of a substandard service
2128197 this is about whats best for the children who need only the kind of high specialized care that only childrens can offer
2128198 we think it is a sad state of affairs when upmc resorts to using babies as chattel in their desire to dominate the regions health care
2128199 there is more likely to be complications any time you move a patient
2128200 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
2128201 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
2128202 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market
2128203 the job market isnt strong right now as we work through the downturn in housing and high energy prices we would like to see more job creation
2128204 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
2128205 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
2128206 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
2128207 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
2128208 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
2128209 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
2128210 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
2128211 your avarice your arrogance and your hubris led to your demise
2128212 you could have operated in a legitimate fashion with ncfe but you chose not to
2128213 the cover up in this case involves some of the most egregious behavior youll ever read about in this kind of securities case
2128214 this is going to be a very promotional challenging back to school season
2128215 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2128216 freddie bought loans that were on some level just as risky as what was subprime
2128217 we expected credit would continue to deteriorate and it has admittedly even faster than we thought
2128218 no intention to get down below the minimum capital level
2128219 needs to raise capital today not wait and hope for a chance to raise cheaper capital in the future
2128220 i dont think it would be a good idea to have pension obligations similarly passed around
2128221 for technical reasons these transactions are not currently permitted under law but as a policy matter they should be
2128222 the players in this think the market is potentially very big
2128223 but we gotta win the majority of them to keep ourselves in it
2128224 its huge because of where we are in the standings and having to catch people
2128225 its hard to swallow to lose a 3 0 game with our offense
2128226 but its one of those games where youve got to tip your cap to the pitcher he pitched a heck of a game

2128238 no nos son necesarias palabras gruesas tenemos razones y argumentos
2128239 esperaremos y trabajaremos para que haya nuevas bases y nuevas propuestas sobre las cuales edificar un espacio propio para catalunya dentro de una nueva arquitectura
2128240 lo que de verdad no tiene salida es mantener un sistema y un modelo injusto con los ciudadanos de catalunya

2128247 i saw this picture online and id like to try it using a wooden ladder instead of the stainless rungs i thought that would be easier to recreate in my rental but i think ive set myself up for failure all the ladders ive found online are either too new or too short id like to find a 9 foot tall non ugly wooden ladder that leans against the wall like something youd find in an old farmhouse do you have any thoughts where someone might find something like that

2128263 i was getting very annoyed about it because i didnt know what was going to happen i sent them letters and spoke to them but i didnt get anywhere the letters i received got more and more threatening then i got a final warning
2128264 id sent the cheques by recorded delivery and had kept my bank statements so i knew i was right

2128266 mr hartle left npower on march 11 he had 201 57 outstanding on his gas account and 119 89 on his electric

2128275 simply put this industry is booming with exciting new developments and innovation in technology as a user and analyst of such technology its often difficult to integrate specific products strategies and solutions into the big picture that modern organizations and businesses demand

2128278 maybe i am just an introvert or maybe i just want some time alone i have never understood the fascination with everyone in the world being able to find out everything i do and track me down it is cool to find out that you are at some expo and find out that there is a new gadget from twitter the fact that you are now going to the restroom is more than i need to know yes unified communications may become like facebook or myspace but i hope not i would much rather have technology as a tool rather than a function of my life when was the last time you just sat down with your customers and actually talked with them not in sound bytes of product promotions but in actual engaging conversation just because you have a lot of blinking lights and buttons to push does not make quality of conversation better it only makes it easier and in greater quantity it is instant and frequent hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more for unified communications and in the end what measurable value have you provided to the customer
2128279 but when i was younger i didnt really know what i was capable of doing i didnt do anything to help the environment therefore i thought i couldnt do anything
2128280 obviously when they were looking for someone to do this project they were looking for someone who has a specific area of interest
2128281 a lot of my work was environmental and i did mention project porchlight because of course thats an environmental project

2128285 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2128286 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2128287 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2128288 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated

2128292 its massive amounts of information rather than massive amounts of energy that distinguishes our economy from that of 50 or 100 years ago
2128293 massive amounts of energy consumption and massive amounts of information that distinguish our economy from that of 50 or 100 years ago
2128294 if we are going to do anything about climate change one implication is that energy must get a good deal more expensive perhaps three or four times as expensive as it is now
2128295 its massive amounts of information rather than massive amounts of energy that distinguishes our economy from that of 50 or 100 years ago
2128296 if we had enough energy we could make anything we needed with modern technology
2128297 seems to me this is a global project of epic proportions bigger than the war effort of 1939 45 the manhattan project the snowy mountains scheme it is in fact the greatest economic transition since the industrial revolution
2128298 to build this massive renewables infrastructure we need trucks cranes construction equipment in short a lot of oil oil that in all likelihood will be very very expensive in the future
2128299 if energy input costs to food production including transportation energy embodied in fertilizer etc are say 10 a 4 fold increase in energy costs will produce about a 30 increase in food costs cost of personal transport would rise by more at the household level once you lump increases in food and transport two of the biggies in abs household expenditure surveys and other indirect cost effects with the direct costs i e higher utility bills the increases in cost of living will be quite large and moreover will be highly regressive wont this cause significant economic damage enough to cause a slow down even a significant recession then we have the situation where incomes are not increasing but costs are and moreover are increasing fastest for those with least capacity to absorb them that sounds pretty serious
2128300 sin taxes is already more dependant on consumption taxes and less progressive than many other developed countries there will also be ideological opposition to any atempt to offset the regressive impact of carbon pricing through increased government transfer payments

2128322 once sufficiently nourished to ensure for survival oysters focus on development of sexual organs creating sperm and ovaries mostly and ignore their defense systems
2128323 oysters are capable of only one function at once especially in springtime so if a threat is posed during this period of concentrated sexual development theyre very susceptible
2128324 since we cant vaccinate shellfish one way of protecting future generations is to use oysters that are resistant to oshv 1 and generally more robust in reproduction to produce future oyster generations that may better withstand the virus
2128325 many patients in india enter into clinical trials because they have no better option to receiving care
2128326 one of the major problems of clinical trials in india is that they are not publicized as clinical trials
2128327 physicians are attracted by inducements of foreign travel funds and fame of the four stakeholders the sponsor or drug company hospital investigator and patient three are on one side
2128328 why should we keep india behind everyone else why close our doors for business when we have the capabilities
2128329 since trials for foreign sponsors must follow international rules they actually help raise indian standards the experience with other outsourcing industries has also been that more business has brought better regulation and monitoring
2128330 companies spend resources to train people and bring in expensive equipment
2128331 over time as the overload from big institutes flows to smaller ones in second tier cities the benefits will spread farther
2128332 conducting clinical trials is not like landing a man on the moon

2128465 i thought my father would be more devastated but i was taken aback by his energy here was the mosque here was the school here was the tree the stone buildings were still there as ruins but the village was very clear to him he had a reconstructed image of absence you could spend a lifetime mulling that experience over
2128466 that strange animal the lyric poet in whom circumstance and profession as distinct from will and fashion have compelled obsession with large social contexts under other conditions one could imagine this dreamy inwardness absorbed entirely in the natural world
2128467 you write what youve lived i couldnt have ignored doctors without borders
2128468 he couldve told us about the indians but he never mentions them
2128469 turned a decaying carcass of french industrial society into a beautiful poem whitman missed that
2128470 he rose to the top in just one term kept texas in power made lesser states squirm big john big bad john
2128471 i hope you got a smile out of that video
2128472 my staff convinced me it would be a good idea maybe i need a new staff
2128473 it was an attempt to bring a little humor to a subject i take very seriously
2128474 my policy on the war on terror is similar to ronald reagan we win they lose
2128475 none of your civil liberties matter much after youre dead
2128476 ive opposed immoral experimentation done in the name of science
2128477 but his judicial philosophy was to not legislate from the bench whatever your personal opinion is or whatever you think public policy should be thats not your job there there are some people who have been judges who didnt quite get over the fact that they werent legislators anymore i dont think that was johns reputation
2128478 hes well regarded in republican circles for his ability to articulate an argument particularly on television
2128479 hes someone who gets media and that has helped his career when your colleagues see you doing that they want to promote you
2128480 it does not affect your life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle but that does not mean that its right now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife
2128481 i dont know if there is a cause and effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country
2128482 i wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in engage in violence
2128483 hes really changed his political and philosophical outlook on governing he is being led and advised by a group of people that would rather have him taking votes that are divisive in his heart i dont think thats who he is but thats certainly who he has become hes always been a moderate or at least until he got elected i dont think he had those conservative ideologies ingrained in him until he went up to d c
2128484 what he might write in a decision on the texas supreme court may be very different than what he would do legislatively
2128485 there are a fairly limited number of issues where hes reached across the aisle
2128486 im not sure thats the best use of that money
2128487 i am a democrat but i cannot say no to sen cornyn because he has been good to us
2128488 the fact of the matter is he supported the expansion of s chip he just didnt support it to the level that rick noriega did
2128489 hes seen as one of the rising stars in the republican party
2128490 the future for him is bright in terms of republican leadership
2128491 dan adamantly denies any involvement in participating in frauds on credit card transactions
2128492 there was no way for him to receive any money from this scheme so its purely illogical why he would even engage in such a scheme
2128493 they met with the occupants asked if he was there and they told the deputies he was not
2128494 the person they were after my son didnt know he was in the house
2128495 anyone who harbors a sex offender is going to go jail just like the four who went today
2128496 ron artest has angered me again i hereby ban him from being inside me for 10 of my games in which the rockets play dont forget i am on tnt tonight at 8 00
2128497 we cant both look good its me or the house
2128498 we dont know why they exited then re entered from another window
2128499 but we do know they used a cart inside the school to help them remove the laptops
2128500 we are still trying to pin down exactly what happened with that hook up
2128501 its operating now but we dont know why it malfunctioned over the weekend
2128502 the school was insured so the computers will be replaced by the insurance company minus the deductible of course but its just a shame that this happened
2128503 here we are trying to create a wonderful learning environment for children and someone does this its disheartening
2128504 it all started about seven years ago when my generation of friends went to a village hall meeting and persuaded the members of the board to build the skate park
2128505 after a couple years i noticed the people who used to attend the skate park were not going as much anymore thats when i realized we not only had to create an effort to bring back the skaters but create something to engage the community
2128506 the competition gives skateboarders in the area something to look forward to
2128507 its a great opportunity for those who have signed up to practice their skills and show off some new tricks and their talents
2128508 we will be judging on style quantity of tricks and technique
2128509 we are going to treat everyone equal that means we are going to root for the beginners just as much as the experts
2128510 we will have first second and third prizes for skateboarders per each division of beginners intermediates and experts
2128511 if a skateboarders second run is not as good as their first run we will judge the better score
2128512 we want people to realize that skateboarding is a sport and it takes a lot of hard work and practice for competitions like the one we are hosting
2128513 we hope to change a few perspectives and bring a more skate orientated environment into antioch
2128514 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2128515 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2128516 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources

2128523 taxpayers save 25 000 for every job that is put up for competition because even when the government keeps the job it significantly improves efficiency and reduces costs
2128524 reasons right wing funders have reason to wonder how their generous contributions are being spent given that it merely copies ombs own a 76 savings claim which no independent third party whether an inspector general or a government accountability office auditor has ever corroborated
2128525 congressional attitudes toward competition do not appear to be warming either
2128526 on a bipartisan basis congress is insisting that agencies look at alternatives to a 76 including insourcing
2128527 even omb has recognized this dropping the limited and unpopular competitive sourcing in favor of the broader approach of commercial management
2128528 we have officially handed over our code to the microsoft office team for the integration of the translation tool directly in the research task pane once they have finished their own testing and flipped the switch on their side the feature will auto update in existing versions of office

2128540 this means the considerable amount of online video available to other users is out of reach of the linux crowd
2128541 you wonder why theyd want to kiss off 2 3 of the desktops
2128542 what ive also said is since ive taken this job that every option is on the table and every option will continue to be considered
2128543 we are looking at every strategic option for the iden network including improvements investments partnerships or divestments
2128544 saying they want to sell it is one thing somebody wanting to buy it is another
2128545 i think they are stuck with it they wanted to merge and now they are really merged
2128546 the company decided to cancel the offering because the terms being offered were not economically attractive due to unfavorable market conditions
2128547 it was probably also due to market reaction to its equity
2128548 there is considerable marketplace interest in the gametap business and brand
2128549 we are considering various strategic options but have reached no final agreement as yet when there is a resolution we will announce it
2128550 regarding brian he recently resigned to form a startup technology company outside the game industry which is why weve posted about the open position this change wont impact the game were really pleased with the look and feel that brian helped create for diablo iii and the new person we bring onboard will work with the other artists on the team to maintain the art style moving forward
2128551 if you want to blame anyone for the rainbows youd blame our art director brian morrisroe because brian is more the person who drove the art style into where it is but it didnt really come directly from him what he brought to the art team was concepts and ideas the idea of contrast the idea of using color more the idea of going for a more stylized look because what we were looking at before was more photo realistic really trying to get something that looks like a painting that was his goal but the actual result of that came from the art team and a lot of the environment guys and some of the texture artists theyve all kind of chipped in to try and get the feel of something that was very unique

2128669 the writedown is primarily an accounting transaction and has no impact on shareholder value or cash
2128670 virgin mobile adds value because customers who take all four products are more valuable to us because they stay longer but the account ing rules dont take account of value created in other areas of the business
2128671 virgin media is spinning the story about the major growth potential created by its broadband capability and that will be the issue on which the company stands or falls

2128681 in a world in which free people have no atomic monopoly we must keep our atomic strength at peak level time is a key factor in this task and nevada tests help us buy precious time
2128682 i want you to know that in the forthcoming series as has been true in the past each shot is justified by national and international security need and that none will be fired unless there is adequate assurance of public safety
2128683 we are grateful for your continued cooperation and your understanding
2128684 more than three and a half decades have now passed since the first atomic test at alamogordo new mexico july 16 1945 and the subsequent detonations at hiroshima and nagasaki

2128686 it seems no accident that we are currently suffering from a national cancer epidemic in which one of every five americans dies of that dread disease
2128687 it would be plausible and prudent to assume that the radioactive fallout weve introduced into the global atmosphere literally tens of tons of debris from bomb tests alone is a significant factor in addition to industrial pollution and cigarette smoking
2128688 as early as the 1950s the american linus pauling and the russian andrei sakharov both nobel prize winners warned that literally millions of people would die worldwide because of these bomb tests
2128689 similar tragedies have struck american soldiers present at scores of bomb tests that followed from 1945 through the early 1960s some 300 000 men and women in u s uniform were exposed to radiation from atmospheric underwater and underground bomb tests
2128690 i believe that monthly rents should not be offered solely to retailers as a result of their financial position but as standard practice where this fits with an occupiers business practices
2128691 some brc members have been successful in securing monthly rents on over 90 per cent of new and renewed leases over the past two years
2128692 we have been working with the brc over the last two years and across the board landlords are being more flexible in terms of the packages they offer retailers
2128693 some landlords are still refusing to face reality however the enlightened ones are now settling for a nil increase by negotiation rather than having a lower rent stipulated by an arbitrator

2128696 weve been trying to talk to boeing about orders beyond 2012 but their prices are too high
2128697 weve started talking with airbus about the possibility of taking airbus aircraft
2128698 every day longer it takes us to get on stream thats another day of construction costs and operating costs
2128699 you have all of this activity going on in the oil sands and not all of it can come in on time and on budget
2128700 given that canadian natural was so close to being done and here we have a further announcement of cost increases that is somewhat disappointing but in the big picture it really doesnt make that much of a difference
2128701 we can grow by building additional capacity on existing sites increasing ownership in other assets or by new build such as in the middle east and south east asia
2128702 the market may be disappointed by the issues at rugeley but we believe the key is the outlook for the business which remains strong
2128703 there is not a shred of truth to it whatsoever
2128704 its absolute fabrication it was just the victims friends sitting around with some beers trying to come up with theories on how it might have happened
2128705 obviously had the girlfriend been on the bus when the police took the 35 statements from the people on the bus immediately after the incident she would have said im his girlfriend this is what happened and we would have laid a first degree murder charge instead of a second degree
2128706 at this point everything is pointing toward a random attack there hasnt been any link that anybody can sort out
2128707 this has been a difficult week and a half for us
2128708 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs dep more uties who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2128709 i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2128710 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2128711 she was literally in the kitchen cooking a lovely pasta dish and they brought down the door and shot our dogs
2128712 they didnt know my name all they knew was my wifes name they matched that to the registration of the car
2128713 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2128714 i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate
2128715 the special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
2128716 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed
2128717 we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
2128718 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation
2128719 this is a chance for earnie to put a disappointing two years behind him because he has gone backwards he knows my feelings on it
2128720 he knows there are under 21 strikers ready to jump over his head
2128721 he knows about the threat of the under 21 lads because we are looking to push ched evans and sam vokes up into the first team shortly
2128722 when i first became wales manager i only had john hartson bellamy and earnshaw up front but now theres competition
2128723 paul needed a bit of time to sort out his personal problems which we understood
2128724 now were pleased to have him back in the wales squad because he can play in a number of positions
2128725 and we felt that using a bellamy and parry partnership away from home with their pace would have been interesting due to the way we set up our team
2128726 whenever steve has been with us he has done very well
2128727 his attitude has been first class i cant fault him for wales
2128728 the centre back partnership is a big concern for me at the moment

2128733 remember it is not hpv per se that causes the cancer
2128734 no significant evidence of a vaccine therapeutic effect was observed it is unlikely that vaccination could have a significant beneficial impact on rate of lesion progression
2128735 gardasil has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity cancer or genotoxicity gene mutation
2128736 how many girls will develop fertility or reproductive problems cancer or damage to their genes all of which merck admits in its product insert that it has not studied at all
2128737 the vaccine has not been out long enough for us to understand what all of the potential side effects are going to be
2128738 young girls are experiencing severe headaches dizziness temporary loss of vision slurred speech fainting seizures muscle weakness tingling and numbness in the hands and feet and joint pain some of the girls have lost consciousness during what appears to be seizures
2128739 serious neurologic thromboembolic and autoimmune complications have been reported in patients who received human papillomavirus hpv vaccines the side effects that have been reported are real and they cannot be brushed aside
2128740 if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant you should not receive this vaccine

2128751 survey reports and hard data point to further deterioration in the economy with the beleaguered state of the housing market exacerbating the extent of the downturn the mpc will need to ease policy as further evidence emerges that rising food and fuel prices are not becoming entrenched in the wage bargaining process this should be visible later in the year
2128752 while the government talks of the need for an economic recovery plan to restart growth in the uk the bank is doing all it can to hold down consumer confidence and business investment this is not the time to be holding rates when the prospects for the economy in 2009 look increasingly weak the bank should cut and cut fast

2128755 contributing to the companys disappointing financial results in the second quarter was the lack of new product launches which is the lifeline of the u s generics industry
2128756 however i am still confident in our strategy and the outlook for the remainder of 2008 and beyond
2128757 it appears that the wheels are coming off the base business
2128758 management is attempting to further diversify into brands but given its constrained balance sheet and competitive landscape for licensed products it is difficult to gain conviction that this strategy will be successful

2128762 denmark is the model that the united states should be following
2128763 very little can happen without having the utilities involved in the process

2128765 although second quarter margins improved from first quarter levels unplanned downtime prevented us from fully capitalizing on these higher margin levels

2128769 we have cause to believe that this was a human smuggling operation and so the people involved were illegally in the united states
2128770 the smuggler doesnt care if their cargo lives or dies

2128780 the uk laptop market is vast and if someone was able to make and sell the products significantly cheaper than others because the others were ripping us off they would do so and they would make a killing
2128781 the fact that this does not happen tends to indicate there are indeed hidden costs as well as the transparent ones such as taxes that mitigate against much cheaper products im not saying that there are no rip offs but not all cases can be as clear cut as they seem

2128793 it would in my opinion create a most unhelpful precedent if a court exercising divorce jurisdiction exceptionally and transiently seised with jurisdiction in matters relating to parental responsibility were to issue an order permitting a parent to leave the jurisdiction of the childs habitual residence without any involvement of the courts of the childrens long settled residence
2128794 the grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility established in the present regulation are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child in particular on the criterion of proximity this means that jurisdiction should lie in the first place with the member state of the childs habitual residence except for certain cases of a change in the childs residence or pursuant to an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility
2128795 the courts of a member state shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that member state at the time the court is seised
2128796 the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article 3 on an application for divorce legal separation or marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in any matter relating to parental responsibility connected with that application where a at least one of the spouses has parental responsibility in relation to the child and b the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by the spouses and by the holders of parental responsibility at the time the court is seised and is in the superior interests of the child
2128797 the petition shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the petitioner personally and if practicable agreed with the respondent containing the information required by form m4
2128798 before you issue a petition for divorce try to reach agreement with your husband wife over the proposals for the childrens future there is space for him her to sign at the end of this form if agreement is reached
2128799 the petitioner has completed parts i ii and iii of this form which will be sent to the court at the same time that the divorce petition is filed if you agree with the arrangements and proposals for the children you should sign part iv of the form if you do not agree with all or some of the arrangements or proposals you will be given the opportunity of saying so when the divorce petition is served on you
2128800 please refer to the explanatory notes issued regarding the completion of the prayer of the petition if you are asking the court to make any order regarding the children
2128801 they are habitually resident in spain they have never lived in england the petitioner did not discuss such a change with the respondent
2128802 1 the court shall not make absolute a decree of divorce or annulity of marriage or grant a decree of judicial separation unless the court by order has declared that it is satisfied a that for the purposes of this section there are no children of the family for whom this section applies or b that the only children who are or may be children of the family to whom this section applies are the children named in the order and that i arrangements for the welfare of every child so named have been made and are satisfactory or are the best that can be devised in the circumstances or
2128803 application for care and custody maintenance and an order that the children should not be taken out of the country without prior authorisation in writing from this court
2128804 the wife wishes to be free to move back to england with her three children but the father refuses to allow them to leave him retains the childrens passports and has been actively pursuing a policy of disaffection to get the children to stay with him only now that the spanish court is no longer seised of the children can mother take action to regain the children and regularise the situation and arrange proper contact for them with father
2128805 therefore a stay of the proceedings is ordered without prejudice to the provisions of the second section of article 28 cited of the regulation that is at the request of a party it is appropriate to order a waiver in favour of the english court hearing the proceedings brought by mrs bush with number fd07d0333 in the high court of justice central registry of the family division provided that it is competent to hear the related actions and that its law allows their joinder partly granting the relief sought by the respondent as competence is not declined in favour of the english court but a stay of the proceedings is ordered owing to relatedness of the actions without prejudice to the fact that a waiver may be ordered in favour of the english court hearing the petition of mrs bush in the terms indicated
2128806 1 by way of exception the courts of a member state having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter may if they consider that a court of another member state with which the child has a particular connection would be better placed to hear the case or a specific part thereof and where this is in the best interests of the child a stay the case or the part thereof in question and invite the parties to introduce a request before the court of that other member state in accordance with paragraph 4 or b request a court of another member state to assume jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 5
2128807 accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seised
2128808 the grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility established in the present regulation are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child in particular on the criterion of proximity this means that jurisdiction should lie in the first place with the member state of the childs habitual residence except for certain cases of a change in the childs residence or pursuant to an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility

2128810 having watched gmp shares plunge 19 per cent since the end of june we were of the view that the market was gradually pricing in the cut in the distribution
2128811 as perverse as it sounds the decrease today does remove the uncertainty that had plagued the shares
2128812 a yield in the 11 per cent range on the new 1 25 annual distribution suggests to us a reasonable bottom on the stock

2128865 the latest data show the slowdown in uk economic activity gathering pace and business and consumer confidence falling further
2128866 however with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months the bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being
2128867 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
2128868 we are not surprised that rates remained at 5 we feel that with inflation rising over the next few months possibly to up to 5 in the autumn the mpc was unable to give the economy any relief via lower rates but we are happy it had resisted the temptation to raise rates

2128875 apple is the seventh largest personal computer vendor in the world but is widely regarded as one of the most innovative technology companies in the world key factors are enabling mac momentum to defy macro conditions we believe mac performance is due to several unique drivers that were not present in prior downturns we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come
2128876 first apple has successfully reduced the perceived and actual switching costs for windows users looking to adopt the mac platform second apples support of the intel architecture has leveled the playing field in terms of speeds and feeds comparisons between macs and pcs finally apples successful retail strategy has broadened the availability of mac products and given apple more control over the critical computer selling process users can now explore the advantages of the mac platform with highly trained apple sales reps

2128881 the combined effect of paras 19 1 and 6 is that where a child is in the care of a local authority then the child may be sent abroad for instance for the purpose of living with prospective adoptive parents without the serious impediment of those prospective adopters having to come to the uk for 26 weeks
2128882 i have looked at the relevant dfes guidance which is short on the point but certainly encourages the view that it has to be in england and wales i have looked at the adoption with a foreign element regulations 2005 and in particular regulation 10 which sets out the prescribed requirements for the purposes of s 84 3 which must be in place before a court can make a s 84 order they are very detailed and in effect they require the adoption agency to conduct a thorough investigation of the case themselves and produce reports which are in all particulars effectively the same reports that would be provided in an adoption case regulation 10 also makes express reference to the adoption agencies regulations 2005 and and the requirements in regulations 17 and 18 in particular those in turn are very detailed and again really require the agency in this case the local authority as it were a domestic adoption application and undertake the detailed duties that they will have under those regulations in full in a case such as this the following regulation reg 11 of the adoptions with a foreign element regulations is also very comprehensive it lists from a to r the sections of the primary legislation that apply to s 84 cases and i note in particular that s 44 is expressly included in a s 84 application s 44 requires that notice of intention to adopt has to be given to the prescribed local authority the import of all this detail is that this is a process that is to be conducted with the child in england and wales miss corbett has helpfully referred to s 86 of the 2002 act which does indeed give parliament power to modify s 85 by regulations if the prospective adopters are parents miss corbett says that direct communication with the department for education and skills has confirmed that no such regulations have been brought into force it seems to me regrettable that this is the case but the legislation has not been amended and we are where we are
2128883 section 84 4 appears to be the counterpart of section 42 1 and 2 of the 2002 act which applies to domestic adoptions
2128884 the judge was correct to identify the purpose of section s 84 4 as being not just to ensure that a relationship should begin to be established between the adopters and the child over a continuous period in a domestic context but also to enable the domestic authorities to assess mr and mrs c and the relationship each enjoyed with pg
2128885 section 84 of the 2002 act has attracted a great deal of criticism both from practitioners and the family judiciary on the basis that it operates as a significant disincentive to prospective adopters from abroad few people it is argued will have the capacity to interrupt their lives in order to provide a home for a child in this jurisdiction for the statutory period there is of course the provision in section 86 2 of the 2002 act which enables parliament by regulations to disapply section 85 of the prospective adopters are parents relatives or guardian of the child in question or one of them is no such regulations have been made
2128886 mcfarlane j commented in 2005 in h county council v b on the onerous and disproportionate burden imposed on foreign relatives who sought an order under s 84 of the 2002 act by the requirements as to residence in this country there is power to modify the provisions of s 85 by regulation but nothing has been done and i am told by counsel for the gal that the department for children schools and families indicates that no fresh regulations are planned in the immediate future despite the receipt of representations from various quarters about the practical difficulties which are being caused by the present legislation i would urge the department to look at this again

2128889 demonstrates features of a personality disorder of the emotionally unstable borderline type
2128890 has developed features suggestive of alcohol dependence and that she has intermittently engaged with services to address this furthermore there is direct evidence that she developed an injectable opiate habit and may well have also been on opiates
2128891 a n order under this section may impose such conditions as the court considers appropriate
2128892 s and d h have the emotional mental and spiritual maturity to effectively parent children they display appropriate coping skills and understand the needs of an adopted child they have approached their adoption plans with great enthusiasm and will provide their adopted child with a loving nurturing and stable home adoption by shepherd care inc strongly recommends and approves s and dh for adoptive parenting

2128894 4 an application for an order under this section may not be made unless at all times during the preceding ten weeks the childs home was with the applicant or in the case of an application by two people both of them
2128895 7 an adoption order may not be made unless the court is satisfied that sufficient opportunities to see the child with the applicant or in the case of an application by a couple both of them together in the home environment have been given a where the child was placed for adoption with the applicant or applicants by an adoption agency to that agency b in any other case to the local authority within whose area the home is
2128896 2 an adoption order shall not be made unless the child is at least 12 months old and at all times during the preceding 12 months had his home with the applicants or one of them 3 an adoption order shall not be made unless the court is satisfied that sufficient opportunities to see the child with the applicant in the home environment have been afforded b to the local authority within whose area the home is
2128897 the further question remains therefore of what is to be regarded as a home for these purposes
2128898 it is clear from the echr caselaw cited in the harrow case that the term home implies occupation of a dwelling with some intention towards permanency or that there is a requirement of continuous and sufficient links between a person and a place or dwelling
2128899 an adoption agency may a place a child for adoption with prospective adopters or b where it has placed a child with any persons whether under this part or not leave the child with them as prospective adopters but except in the case of a child who is less than six weeks old may only do so under section 19 or a placement order

2128919 camera technologies can benefit directly from these advances we believe more generally that many new application possibilities will emerge from the ability to integrate optoelectronic devices onto curved surfaces bring electronics to the human body in the form of advanced biomedical devices is one broad area of possible application
2128920 we would like to explore the ability of these types of approaches for implantation into the human eye for people who suffer from degeneration of the retina many other problems mainly in the area of biocompatibility and bio interfaces would need to be solved first however
2128921 the novelty is that we are able to conform convention 2 d planar optoelectronics technologies onto curvilinear surfaces such as those of a hemisphere this type of capability can open up new design avenues for advanced camera systems in which not only the lenses but also the geometrical layouts of the detector arrays can be optimized for performance
2128922 the devices that we were able to achieve involve the detector arrays conformally integrated with a hemispherical surface with the size geometry and overall layout of the human eye the imaging characteristics of these devices are better than those possible with planar layouts when simple single component optics are used

2128980 is the design of christs rule to provide peace of the sort being described in this earthly realm
2128981 for the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be leberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of god rom 8 20 21
2128982 there can only be a true peace when the hearts of men have been regenerated by the spirit of god the third person of the ever blessed trinity and a new nature given to them
2128983 an act of gods free grace whereby he pardoneth all our sins and accepteh us as righteous in his sight only for the righteousness of christ imputed to us
2128984 he therefore approaches man with the gracious offer of salvation and brings man to himself giving to him a new heart and declaring that man stands in a right relation to himself man therefore born again from the dead now seeks peace and pursues it in so far as he is now true to the new principle of life within him for sin still remains and prevents him from acting in perfect consistency with his new nature he seeks peace

2129095 you cant tackle the impending obesity pandemic simply by classifying a third of the child population as patients
2129096 unfortunately we cant simply go to the bookshelf and find a recipe that might work for scotland we need to come up with home grown and home tested solutions
2129097 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

2129101 it took place over two and a half years ago long before i became a councillor
2129102 i accept the actions of the party and will wish to take part in the formal hearing on my return to scotland
2129103 councillor hanif is currently in pakistan and has not had the opportunity to put his side of the story
2129104 on the face of it he has not broken the law and there is no suggestion of any involvement in anything untoward nevertheless this was very foolish and inappropriate conduct
2129105 he is well aware of the snps strong views against firearms particularly involving children
2129106 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2129107 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2129108 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2129109 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2129110 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2129111 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

2129116 he appears to be cognizant of his surrounding and acknowledged his partner spencer
2129117 in one skinny mini monstrosity after another pouty posh can really wreck em
2129118 all of a sudden i hear bang bang bang open the door police open the door
2129119 they wouldnt let me go to the bathroom which is like seven feet down the hall
2129120 it was terrifying i cant sit on my couch at night any more im looking over my shoulder the whole time
2129121 i just wanted to go out and hold her a bit they wouldnt even let me go out
2129122 its just not right that people have to worry about police have their jobs to do but the house is marked over there all they had to do was go look
2129123 i want the sheriff to apologize to my family for killing their dog

2129134 i will conduct myself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity independence and impartiality of the judiciary and participate in thoughtful discourse in judicial forums and with the media
2129135 ive been critical of judge hunts record shes made a lot of mistakes
2129136 to the extent people want to spend their money talking about her mistakes and its factual thats great and these ads are factual

2129138 the conditions in the market that we have seen over the course of the last 12 months are as difficult as we have experienced in many years
2129139 although i take some comfort from our relative performance in managing our risks and in generating income a decline in profit of 33 per cent is acutely disappointing
2129140 not least because we are now seeing the impact of slowing economies around the world and that means that we must remain very vigilant to managing risk
2129141 we are completely confident about the rigour we have applied to the mark downs
2129142 people are looking to see a bottom in us housing
2129143 we are not going back to markets like 2005 and 2006 we are going to be in more challenging markets for the balance of 2008 and throughout 2009
2129144 this is as tough an environment as we have operated in my 25 years in the business
2129145 macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years
2129146 sql server 2008 is the only major database that includes comprehensive tightly integrated functionality for data management as well as advanced business intelligence out of the box
2129147 by offering a complete solution we save customers time and money and allow them to focus on deriving the most value from their data assets
2129148 we are not as divided as our politics suggest we are one people we are one nation
2129149 appears directed at governor tim pawlentys own department of human services
2129150 we know that in any of our programs theres always a potential for fraud
2129151 im a little surprised to see it happening in hawaii
2129152 the original maverick finds himself in town today reassuring folks in a private meeting that he cares about job losses
2129153 i dont think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the world trade center that they would try to use an airplane as a missile a hijacked airplane as a missile
2129154 well i think that anyone who looks at it with the benefit of 20 20 hindsight has to say that
2129155 we didnt anticipate the devastation that 30 years of saddams rule had wrought if you will on the psychology of the iraqi people
2129156 i dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees
2129157 the visuals were such that it was acceptable to beat another person particularly a law enforcement officer
2129158 for a person in a management position in any organization to walk around with the severed head of another person in effigy is sickening
2129159 to say we are committing violence against joe arpaio by hitting a papier m che doll is a joke
2129160 when you put together a demonstration you look for ways to make your point in a vivid way
2129161 that may be burning the flag of a sovereign nation
2129162 that may be beating a pi ata its symbolic in no way does it represent harm to an actual individual
2129163 it was in uniform which represents law enforcement it had a picture of his face how is that symbolic
2129164 they hit the pi ata to break the policies that keep us fearful of each other and that have caused so much pain to so many hardworking men women and children
2129165 it is my opinion that her actions at the barnes and noble event bring discredit to pima county
2129166 its an issue but is it a violation of code probably not
2129167 its an issue of judgment but whats the penalty for poor judgment
2129168 im not going to pretend to stop you as you threaten to leave like a small child
2129169 ganz egal welche ma nahmen sie auch ergreifen es wird ihnen nicht gelingen das recht auf freie meinungs u erung abzuschaffen

2129171 ich bin der festen berzeugung dass sich gesellschaften die die freie u erung von ideen zulassen zu den wohlhabendsten und friedlichsten entwickeln
2129172 its a pretty good time to look at all your options i guess
2129173 we will be taking a very focused look at that club
2129174 anyone who publishes regularly on the internet bloggers webmaster and writers who publish on the web
2129175 they want the benefits of web linking but dont want to give up the subscription fees from the fools who continue to pay them
2129176 he eats salad and asparagus and a lot of stuff with his fingers i do that as well thats how we roll in the kitchen
2129177 i even drink prosecco on the rocks i make it like its big girl soda i learned it from cesare casella hed always drink champagne on the rocks
2129178 whats fascinating to me about this research is the index of just how much technology women own
2129179 if you wanted to design technology that would appeal to women it needs to work flawlessly the first time out of the box and every time thereafter they dont have time to faff around
2129180 someday ill eventually see more than just a flat concrete jungle
2129181 in overdeveloped northwest arkansas real estate officials estimate that property values have been steadily declining since 2007
2129182 we sit on our back porch and fantasize that we own all this land
2129183 daily life in these developments seems a bit post cataclysmic
2129184 theres the initial shock of this being the best company in the space and it just fell short
2129185 de variabel waar alle fouten inkomen als er ene fout is
2129186 iron accumulates with senescence in several organs but little is known about iron accumulation in muscle and how it may affect muscle function
2129187 we went to a lot of trouble to get this deal done and we structured it in a way where there is very little chance that we ever get these c d o s back or take the same risk back
2129188 we would not have needed to raise more capital unless we completed the c d o sale
2129189 we are consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors
2129190 looking ahead based on the current prices for futures commodities the annual inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent
2129191 it should not have come as surprise to anyone that on balance the bank of england felt it could do nothing but sit tight this month a situation that is likely to prevail for a few more months
2129192 the market realized there would be no more rate hikes
2129193 its really a culmination of the markets realization that selling the euro against the dollar is the most rewarding action right now in light of prolonged economic deterioration from europe
2129194 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2129195 its not that the u s data has improved dramatically i think its that the economic picture is deteriorating dramatically elsewhere
2129196 the statement was fairly neutral in tone so those hawks who expected a future rate increase were disappointed
2129197 i tell you which one i would want i want the mass effect one
2129198 a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next mass effect game
2129199 is this a confirmation of a mass effect ds sequel
2129200 im not the person i was last year or even last week im much more capable knowledgeable etc
2129201 we believe actual launch removes significant sentiment overhang from rim shares amp should counter fears of rampant ad spending that has served as addl stock overhang
2129202 while this indicator is volatile and affected to an unknown degree by foreclosures it does suggest that conditions in the resale market for real estate may be stabilizing
2129203 i find it amazing that so few people fail to read the footnotes or methodology of a fairly major housing related release contemptible
2129204 ive always felt that you have an advantage if you can understand a companys product technology or the service it provides and if you understand why anyone would want to buy that product earlier than other investors
2129205 if you had predicted coach would broaden its demographic appeal and parlay that into sales growth you would have had an advantage
2129206 i think individuals can make decent calls on consumer products if theyre on the bell curve of mainstream and can find a product or service that changes behavior and can recognize pop and fizz stories like crocs
2129207 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
2129208 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
2129209 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2129210 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
2129211 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans
2129212 you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
2129213 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
2129214 we are quite concerned with some of the information weve received
2129215 more importantly we are concerned about the welfare of the children and their families
2129216 the audit states 16 times that no response was provided by the school when it asked for a corrective action plan the confidential informant reported that all information to be given to the auditor was to go through joel pourier first
2129217 they failed to implement a balanced budget provide accurate information to state and federal authorities and couldnt account for some money they spent
2129218 he always said i can explain it and we always trusted him
2129219 thats where it just destroyed all the faith i had because i saw check after check written out to him signed by him

2129223 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2129224 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2129225 it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
2129226 hastiness and superficiality these are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century
2129227 yet there is a disaster which is already very much with us
2129228 only by the voluntary nurturing in ourselves of freely accepted and serene self restraint can mankind rise above the world stream of materialism
2129229 socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into death

2129246 the part that the families needed to hear is done there was a reason the accident happened it wasnt a fluke and the charges were valid
2129247 i know the families were hearing all kinds of different things through the months
2129248 we did a poll right away and it was pretty much split
2129249 we talked about everything we wanted to make sure to go over it once twice three and four times to make sure we werent missing anything it was a long hard thing to do
2129250 its really hard to explain those feelings everyone just wants to be careful so nothing that we say is going to cause one more ounce of pain for these families
2129251 when you look at the pictures of her shes a scared young person
2129252 i hear it a lot i dont know what to say
2129253 its not about race if youre going to break the laws you should be accountable
2129254 whenever the kids hear it it just brings reminders all the time
2129255 now we all know what happened and its done and over so we can keep moving on
2129256 the four children theyre not coming back and thats really tough but the ones who are still thankfully healing at least hopefully theyre seeing the fact that justice is served

2129260 they would see it as failure if they dont win gold theyre not going for silver and bronze
2129261 after the athens games the coxless four guys would have felt the mantle of being in such an iconic boat
2129262 but by now they have developed their own confidence and racing tactics
2129263 when steve redgrave retired after sydney i continued in the boat and we quickly moved on post redgrave it wasnt a burden hanging over us
2129264 and the boys currently in charge of the four will feel the same
2129265 they know past success will not win them races in the future they want to create their own history
2129266 they are deserved gold medal favourites in their own right nothing to do with what steve and i achieved in the same boat
2129267 they feel they should win gold because they were world champions in 2005 and 2006 anything other than victory would be a disaster for them
2129268 hes the best rowing coach in the world the sir alex ferguson of our sport who is used to winning
2129269 in the run up to athens we suffered plenty of disruptions as james cracknell and i were initially going to race in the two man boat
2129270 this current four have stronger ingredients as theyve been training together for many years and if youve got that good background of practice and momentum its a lot easier to prepare for a major event
2129271 weve got a really competitive event with five or six crews in with a chance of a medal
2129272 well have to be at out best to even win a bronze but we wont set a limit on what we can achieve
2129273 it has crossed my mind what it would be like to win a medal
2129274 i am glad that my mother raised us to be proud that we were strange

2129305 the toro watersmart symposium is an excellent forum to get everyone together to discuss controlling excess water usage and new conservation methods owners have trouble looking beyond the necessary costs of quality irrigation management
2129306 they also have trouble distinguishing between the conscientious water manager and those who provide minimum service for a cutthroat price water management is the one of the most important issues to clca members right now and the toro symposium offered us yet another opportunity to talk about it with landscapers
2129307 the real hurdle of our programs is the performance requirement
2129308 participants have to meet a water budget for one year and to remain certified they must continue to meet a water budget on at least one project

2129650 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2129651 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2129661 flew has now apparently lost the ability to read a book too for his review of the god delusion turns out to be a review of its index and nothing but its index he only needed to read chapter 1 in order to see the absurdity of his claims about my treatment of einstein

2129706 he also does multiple other things for us that most fans dont see we have ample weapons to create mismatches hank does some things inside for us we have some matchup situations that we may very well be able to take advantage of
2129707 that has been one of my focuses in camp going up and attacking the ball the way i used to

2129810 cette question ne rel ve pas des activit s de laiea
2129811 je ne pense pas quil y ait une discussion ce sujet
2129812 es ist dieselbe alte geschichte diese unternehmen wollen rohstoffe und k mmern sich nicht darum was mit den menschen vor ort geschieht es ist das absolute streben nach profit und autarke und unabh ngige menschen werden dabei hinweggefegt
2129813 georgiens aggression gegen s dossetien wird gegenma nahmen nach sich ziehen
2129814 es ist sehr bedauerlich dass sich diese situation am tag der er ffnung der olympischen spiele entfaltet
2129815 ich hatte die m glichkeit dar ber sowohl mit unseren chinesischen partnern als auch mit dem us pr sidenten zu sprechen
2129816 theres never been a chemical found that affects animals but has no effect on humans
2129817 but i dont like chemicals building up in my blood even when the chemical industry says theres no risk
2129818 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2129819 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
2129820 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
2129821 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2129822 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2129823 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2129824 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2129825 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2129826 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2129827 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2129828 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2129829 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2129830 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2129831 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2129839 when i read about sex i sometimes think i dont know as much about it as i should

2129844 theres nothing wrong with my body and im going to demand respect for it the way it is
2129845 at the beginning of every camp and maybe in the middle and maybe in the end theres a very competitive spirit that happens the teams that can manage it the best and continue to get work done and not have their practices disrupted are the ones that i think maybe get the most done in camp
2129846 some aggression you like certainly a lot of competitive spirit but having that balanced with players staying off the ground the appropriate shots being taken or not taken unless it is scrimmage thats kind of the education process right now
2129847 we look to move as quickly as possible when we see players that are doing well and reward them but also i think it sends a strong message to those who have been passed
2129848 he did a lot better today he does a lot better when he gets a good while to warm up before practice
2129849 because he can move around like he did today i dont think it is real bad hes limited right now but i think he will be better
2129850 hes just hurt ya know what do you do when you are hurt you are hurt i dont know what to say
2129851 certainly clawson is one of the best conditioned players on our team
2129852 he probably had from what ive been told by our players one of the best summers of anyone he did very well on the conditioning test hes been impressive thus far and so hes moving up and up and up
2129853 hes strutting around like he thinks hes pretty good which is great
2129854 so i think he is more confident in what we are doing hes functioned better he knows the offense better and hes starting to get himself in a position where we can use him
2129855 she wanted to try for a baby after the spice girls finished touring

2129864 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2129865 i believe that this war is lost and this surge is not accomplishing anything as is shown by the extreme violence in iraq this week
2129866 our side had tried to send a list of names including the envoy to north korea but the north refused to receive it saying the envoys visit to kaesong is not appropriate

2129929 invasive species in general often have substantial negative effects my biggest concern is about them getting into the streams and rivers that are emptying into the great lakes and they are there right now
2129930 it hasnt spread that rapidly yet the problem is theres potential and the reason that there is potential is that snail loves to hitchhike on humans
2129931 the stream that it was in was a small stream and not fished however all it takes is for one person to go in there and walk into another stream to transport the snail if that happens and once it gets into a stream where fishermen like to fish in it might start spreading very rapidly
