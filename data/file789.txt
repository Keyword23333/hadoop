7890030 in that case the people will hold a convention independent of the governor
7890031 this was a revolutionary statement calling for an extra legal extra constitutional convention only the king through his duly appointed governor had that power
7890032 at which resolves have been entered into derogatory to the dignity of his majesty and his parliament and tending to excite clamour and discontent among the kings subjects in this province
7890033 our traffic monitoring network shows the start of a change in driving patterns and behaviour over the past six to 12 months
7890034 average motorway speeds have reduced as has congestion this indicates a reduction in the volume of vehicles especially hgvs travelling on the roads
7890035 one obvious explanation for this is that rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
7890036 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds it really is a case where less haste can mean more speed
7890037 the fall in congestion is good news in an otherwise bleak picture for uk motorists and shows that motorists are moving journeys out of peak hours where possible
7890038 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other

7890063 when a recession hits businesses often cope with the changes by making budget cuts which can result in employees being laid off
7890064 those laid off employees are often some of the most affected consumers during a recession unlike their former employers cutting their budgets may not be enough to get through the tough times not preparing for these economic surprises in advance is a common problem because no one wants to think it will happen to them fortunately its a problem that can be alleviated starting today with a few changes

7890069 i pulled myself up by my own bootstraps and so can they
7890070 this was exemplified to me a few months ago while in a store
7890071 excuse me he wants to be homeless no one wants to be homeless even though it may appear that way we need to look at experiences such as physical abuse and emotional trauma the man may have encountered that have resulted in his long term homelessness
7890072 while wed like to think that a meal a few bible verses and a place to stay can provide a quick fix for the issue of poverty and homelessness for the most part its not as easy as that
7890073 over the years ive seen much material which attributes homelessness almost purely to a lack of affordable housing while that may be the issue in some cases it is far from universally true
7890074 all well do is take people with seriously debilitating issues
7890075 and give them a place to stay without dealing with the problems that caused their homelessness in the first place
7890076 it is found in a jesus based position and a realization that the lord has called us to be the visible representation of his love here on earth our culture is changed one heart at a time not with the changing of presidents and political parties
7890077 more specifically the solution for our nations burgeoning homeless population is for the homeless to have all of the help and professional services they need but cemented together by a relationship with jesus he is the only one who can give us the ability to successfully face life and navigate the myriad of problems and hurts which we all experience every day
7890078 our research indicates that most consumers would like to see a tax credit for the purchase of long term care insurance
7890079 we are proud to be able to offer americans the chance to make their voices heard and provide an avenue to ask their representatives to give them some tax relief during this challenging economic climate
7890080 tlc act of 2008 could create the type of purchasing incentive most individuals claim is a motivating factor in the purchase of private long term care insurance
7890081 there is a real hunger for tax incentives that will help close the gap between what people think should be done and what theyre actually doing
7890082 with the annual cost of care now at 76 285 based on the genworth financial 2008 cost of care survey and only predicted to rise we need a good solution to cover the unfunded liability of boomers future extended care costs

7890100 few people realize our health is directly tied to the health of the natural world
7890101 the tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected
7890102 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
7890103 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
7890104 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby

7890165 ayer hicimos una propuesta integral todas las sumas que ofrecimos eran remunerativas en blanco nos pusimos como objetivo fortalecer el sueldo b sico y mejorar el volumen de la oferta poner m s plata
7890166 lo que me sorprendi fue el poco nfasis otras veces nos hemos peleado hemos discutido hubo contrapropuestas fue una cosa casi silenciosa fr a nos pidieron un ratito dos minutos volvimos nos dijeron no y se fueron como si este paro de 48 horas estaba pensado quedamos con una mezcla de sorpresa y preocupaci n
7890167 la verdad es que ya no entendemos la postura de los gremios quiero creer que s lo est n defendiendo con mucha virulencia el derecho de los trabajadores

7890180 ive been on the team where i dont get cut ive been cut ive dealt with it all before so i feel like im the kicker until they call me and say youre not our guy and thats when i leave but as far as what i feel right now i feel good and i feel like ive done what theyve asked me to do so i dont see why i should even doubt anything about that

7890183 let me state what i think about those ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7890184 make no mistake we are united we are united for change of course we are democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united
7890185 that could shed light on democratic presidential candidate barack obamas links to onetime 1960s radical bill ayers
7890186 people have been saying the economy is on the wrong track for a long time
7890187 wages have not kept pace with economic growth increased productivity and skyrocketing executive compensation
7890188 the problem isnt what government is taking out of workers paychecks
7890189 energy is absolutely central to any discussion of the economy
7890190 we believe this policy is flawed and needs to be revised if food cost inflation is to be brought under control
7890191 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7890192 however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7890193 weve got a planet to save nothing less is at stake other than civilization as we know it today
7890194 the amount of earnings a worker must give up for gaining health insurance is roughly equal to the amount an employer must pay for such coverage
7890195 people generally like to equate better health with awesomer technology but developing a slightly better drug for late stage cancer a good profitable innovation will do much less for health than getting the flu vaccine to everyone who needs it or creating systems so everyone with elevated cardiac risk is on statins these interventions are low innovation but actually extremely effective saving some level of money on innovation in order to rechannel it to access and basic interventions would probably make the country a whole lot healthier but i dont think youre allowed to say that
7890196 this election is too important to wait around for traditional publishing lead times
7890197 really good and important book on obama will be effectively boycotted
7890198 sex and violence to attack the prophet and his faith
7890199 scandal blew in on the errant wind when i rode into medina clutching safwans waist my neighbors rushed into the street what they saw my wrapper fallen to my shoulders unheeded loose hair lashing my face the wife of gods prophet entwined around another man
7890200 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
7890201 the ethiopian government reminds the press about the law so often that it is hard to understand how it allows prosecutors to violate it so openly
7890202 amares unjustified arrest exposes the unfairness of legislation that allows journalists to be imprisoned for defamation his newspaper dared to question a big companys practices now he like the reporter who wrote the offending article before him are paying the price for having the courage to do their job properly and serve the public interest he should be released at once
7890203 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7890204 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7890205 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7890206 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7890207 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7890208 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7890209 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7890210 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7890211 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7890212 the americans aspire for their country to take a moral stance be an honest broker act in accordance with the u s constitution not ignite wars not spill the blood of innocents in the world and not deceive the american people regarding the danger of terrorism and the need to fight it
7890213 your resume today is not what you send to employers
7890214 your resume is the first 10 results on google and if youre not careful the internet will become an albatross around your neck instead of an asset for your life

7890357 traveller makes his or her own way whereas tourists paths have been beaten into submission long before they go whether singly or as a group there is nothing exclusive about tourism quite the contrary it is primarily inclusive it is an industry determined to embrace you it wants you to check in to the right hotels it wants you to spend as much as you can on fatuous souvenirs it wants you to do machu picchu or the taj mahal it wants you to have the rainforest experience or the mysterious east experience or the rose red city half as old as time experience and it doesnt rerribly mind if you also have the fleeced by muggers on copacabana beach experience and when your 15 days are up it want you to bugger off taking with you no local currency and maybe the odd disgusting parasite or two tourism apart we note how much modern travel writing and media interest now concerns journeys apparently influenced more by the guinness book of records than by a desire to travel per se
7890358 its natural for all of us when we have gone to a certain place to feel that we are the first people who ever went there or thought such sensitive thoughts about it fair enough its what keep us going and validates our experience who can visit the tower of london without musing on the wives of henry viii or visit egypt and not be moved by the size and antiquity of the pyramids but that is ground already covered by myltitudes of people as a writer you must keep a tight rein on your subjective self the traveler touched by new sights and sounds and smells and keep an objective eye on the reader your main task as a travel writer is to find the central idea of the place you are dealing with

7890401 we dont go into this with three tight ends without having what youre going to do in case of another injury you have a contingency plan which well practice this week and well practice next were not going to get caught short
7890402 he runs faster down the field than the rest of them
7890403 the move tight end some call them call them fs instead of being like fullback asaph schwapp in the backfield its a guy who plays closer to the line of scrimmage hes not the primary tight end
7890404 when a defense goes up there and you have multiple tight ends on the field theyll identify one guy as the guy who dictates how were lining up the front in our case that guy will be rudolph unless rudolph isnt in there if it were yeatman and schmidt the opposition would dictate that its yeatman they would know by pure depth that rudolph and yeatman are more the natural ys
7890405 hes 265 pounds hes a nice solid blocker hes got soft hands but kyle runs vertically down the field pretty fast
7890406 he could be a move tight end an f or a stationary tight end a y hes the one that gives us position flexibility kyle would kind of be locked down and luke would be locked down in what their jobs are will will be that guy that gives us enough flexibility to go in and out without missing much

7890428 but the subsequent unwinding of leveraged commodities trades was not triggered by the decision to hold rates steady spooking investors per se it was the accompanying statement of the ecb read by its chairman
7890429 isnt problematic because it promotes homosexuality but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention both from perrys boyfriend and her audience

7890438 think of a time in your life when you were hurt
7890439 lets sit around in a drum circle and hum our energy
7890440 i may have been the crazy one but he was either attracted to crazy or had his reasons for being with crazy but if you looked at each of us in the relationship i was the crazy one i was the bad guy well i was the one who was acting it out
7890441 no matter what happens this is how you will win you get to show them that youre down but youre not out youre not dead
7890442 the only thing you can change is you and the amends you need to make are made when you change and send the good of those changes out into the world
7890443 margaret im at a loss for how to handle this i did you a favor months ago and you still havent paid me even though my secretary has sent you numerous bills not entirely true she sent me two please call me as soon as you get this message to let me know whats going on
7890444 people talk about what they do all day and how they feel about what they do
7890445 i dont want to say there is some magical solution here
7890446 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
7890447 were excited to get out there and compete against someone else
7890448 we start off with a tough slate of competitors and we have to be ready to go right out of the gate were looking forward to seeing how good we are right now
7890449 its an easier process from a coaching standpoint when you have a good group of veterans
7890450 great players teach other players to be great weve had a lot of mentorship throughout the preseason and thats helped our younger players acclimate much faster than ever before having that high level of play in our practices every day is extremely productive and were excited to see where that takes us
7890451 a lot of the feedback weve been getting from players is that we need to add more content
7890452 especially to the later parts of the game and thats something we agree to completely and thats what were doing right now
7890453 some of the feedback from the players is that we need to make the dungeons even more interesting
7890454 one of the sources we draw inspiration from is movies one of the biggest trap movies is indiana jones in this area right here weve borrowed a little bit from indiana jones as youll see
7890455 we wanted to borrow a little bit from world of warcraft
7890456 the gaming company probably consists of 98 males so this is what happens you know
7890457 people have been waiting for the pvp update for a long time

7890459 convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others
7890460 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7890461 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7890462 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7890463 this sends the wrong message to other perpetrators of violent crimes against women that they will not be held accountable for their actions
7890464 while there appears to be conflicting reports on the circumstances of the release of these prisoners whatever the circumstances this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
7890465 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
7890466 i have my itunes library located on an external drive works nicely but every now and then the location of the library resets to the default location music i keep the external drive mounted at all times

7890469 no way would kenny ever actually get this tattoo even at gunpoint
7890470 a keyboard controller deserves to be introduced with its own game this is something were thinking about
7890471 there are reasons why we havent included a keyboard controller
7890472 adding a keyboard controller would either have limited our choices or the players

7890474 die mittelschicht in der einkommensverteilung ist durch verluste nach unten und aufstiege nach oben erheblich ausged nnt worden
7890475 the coastline as it is now will be completely changed by the end of this century because the sea level is rising along the coast at around two centimetres every year
7890476 increasing salinity will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
7890477 it is all due to climate change the greenhouse gas emissions result in global warming and subsequent melting of the greenland ice cap
7890478 i think the best way out for the moment is devising simpler and more cost effective solutions such as how to preserve towns and villages under threat and preventing sea water intrusion
7890479 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta
7890480 every solution to a problem must focus on the major cause of that problem and in this case greenhouse gas emissions by industrialised countries which are responsible for sea level rise must be effectively tackled
7890481 the industrialised countries should take proactive steps in curtailing their emissions responsible for climate change which will have a positive impact on sea level rise
7890482 i think reading will keep the majority of the lads who are there now
7890483 the season has started and i think the gaffer has said he doesnt want to lose anyone now the fees will probably go up anyway
7890484 of course if someone really wants someone then they will get it done but i think they will probably keep hold of everyone now and hopefully have a good season and see where that takes them hopefully back in the premiership
7890485 he is good no doubt about it last season was one of those where as a team we werent clicking in the right way the way we were the year before
7890486 it goes like that some seasons we tried to do enough to stay up but it wasnt to be
7890487 you can tell a a man who boozes by the company he chooses and you can tell volumes about a politician comfortable with the likes of acorn tony rezko jeremiah wright and william ayers
7890488 i really dont care how many houses you have but it does matter how you got that house
7890489 this race is very complicated because there is an african american candidate for president
7890490 we feel there is a racial component for some union members but were confident we can overcome that
7890491 i think theres more resistance than people want to admit
7890492 its ingrained that voting for a black is anathema to everything in their core
7890493 racial prejudice is being cited among senior union leaders to explain sen barack obamas difficulty in winning over support from white rank and file members

7890497 not exactly the foot that most canadians would want to see put forward
7890498 conservatives are supposed to be pro business this is business its a 5 billion industry and given that that industry particularly in toronto is at deaths door right now youd think that the federal government would be doing everything it could to help
7890499 while crime has fallen in scotland we continue to lock up more offenders than ever before this is the absurd situation we inherited
7890500 we need to lock up those who are a danger to our communities and who commit serious offences
7890501 less serious offences need to be dealt with by tough community punishments
7890502 from the apostles of the first century to pope john paul the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7890503 abide by international law as the basis for resolving this crisis
7890504 todays announcement by president medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
7890505 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
7890506 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
7890507 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7890508 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7890509 se un giorno il narratore tace o lo fanno tacere nessuno pu dire cosa combiner loceano
7890510 if you take the whole gamut of threats from state sponsored organisations to industrial espionage private individuals and malcontents youre talking about a remarkable number of attempted attacks on our system id say in the thousands
7890511 as with the past financial year the next 12 months of trading will be a period of uncertainty characterised by a series of unanswered questions as your chairman i am forced to conclude that the answers my friends are blowin in the wind
7890512 as you know we have been taking a long hard look at the manning levels in our slimmed down sales force these are the chaps at the sharp end out there on the ground how many roads must a man walk down before we can say weve got the manning levels right
7890513 even now we cannot be sure weve got our sums spot on when it comes to main roads walked down by members of our sales team and this issue will continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future and there is no way of knowin which way the wind is blowin
7890514 the export market is crucial to us and yet at the moment our white dove resources are overstretched and this is hampering our export drive
7890515 i have questioned ministers on numerous occasions asking them specifically how many seas a white dove must sail before it is allowed to sleep in the sand but my friends there is no need to tell you where the answer to that one is blowin
7890516 its the same story in the important revenue earning arms trade branch of our operations
7890517 all these issues must be viewed in the long term context your board and i and also our superb management team are only too well aware that the times they are a changin
7890518 one new phenomenon is the massive surge in the worldwide demand for limited supplies of apostrophes required to replace the outdated letter g this has coincided with the unprecedented expansion of the small hand held jangly percussion instrument sector
7890519 yes the tambourine market has almost reached saturation point meanwhile the us giant corporation mr tambourine man inc is flexing its muscles and trying to move into areas where we have traditionally been strongest
7890520 now its not just a question of supplying apostrophes for in the jingle jangle mornin ill come followin you
7890521 we are having to deal with a limited world supply of apostrophes rapidly emerging economies such as india and china are now moving into large scale tambourine production and the simplest indian or chinese peasant will be wanting to use apostrophes
7890522 is the developing world going to tell them they have to stick with the letter g the answer to that one is also blowin in the wind in the meantime it will not surprise you to hear that i am announcing a reduced dividend
7890523 we also have to make contingency plans in case the unthinkable happens and the mountain is quite literally washed to the sea how many years can a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea im blowed if i know
7890524 all the same because of the dangerous times we live in we must prepare for it this will involve restructuring the company from top to bottom and overhauling management somebody has got to get hold of the company and give it a good shake i have reluctantly concluded that it aint me babe

7890530 the ant people are wonderful builders and architects they can show us ways to build a reality based on our dreams ants are determined and relentless in pursuit of their mission if the ant people come to visit you it may be this quality they will teach solidarity and collaboration are keys to the success of the ant every individual in the community does its duty to ensure the welfare of the whole colony regardless of its personal safety or how long it must labor the ant spirit teaches us teamwork and loyalty ants are unselfish and sacrifice themselves to benefit the community learning this valuable lesson of the ant can be the greatest of all gifts ants are tireless workers and hunters and teach the art of perseverance and patience in all that they do those with this spirit will find that many of their life lessons will involve the mastery of patience in some way ant medicine is subtle yet powerful it teaches us how to release our egos and aligns us with the virtue of equality imagine what the world would be like if humanity held and applied the values that the ant expresses the next time you step on squash injure or kill an ant intentionally ask yourself why you are choosing to destroy the unconditional love that the ant shares so freely valuable insights about yourself and your history can be learned from this tiny little totem

7890546 he seems to be spewing the absurdity that all scientologists are mentally ill the last time we heard garbage like this was from joseph goebbels
7890547 under no circumstances is dr drew making a blanket diagnosis about scientology nor mr cruise whom he does not know dr drew was simply using mr cruise as an example of someone who is recognizable to help the public understand again dr drew meant him no harm

7890574 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7890575 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7890576 we wanted to give something back because they did so much for kristian and ourselves nothing was too much trouble for them
7890577 we have at least 1 000 to donate and we dont know whether they will spend the money on medical equipment or something for the young cancer patients there
7890578 ward 16 at the royal victoria hospital in newcastle is like a youth club within a hospital there are hi fis pool tables and all sorts to keep teenagers occupied
7890579 i had lumps in my neck for a long time and the doctor used a fancy word when i was diagnosed it was only when mum stated to cry i realised it was serious
7890580 but the treatment started so quickly that i did not have time to be worried about anything and all my family and its a big family kept urging me to be positive
7890581 i feel great now and im really looking forward to getting back on the rugby field i love the game and hopefully i can make the aspatria colts next season
7890582 i cant wait for the trip to florida some of my cousins visit every two or three years and they are always telling me how great it is the theme parks and the whole experience
7890583 all teenage cancers are rare and more aggressive than they are in adults but if you are to get a cancer this is the best one to get the recovery rate is so high
7890584 i think kristian maybe took the news better than we did as parents he was very matter of fact about it although i suspect deep down he was not so calm
7890585 he was worried about two things one was losing his hair which he always gelled and the other was missing out on a family holiday to egypt that was planned
7890586 of course both things happened but we told him that there would be many more chances to have a holiday now that dream can come true for him
7890587 it was a very intensive course of treatment based on methods used in germany which have been very successful
7890588 it involved the use of steroids combined with chemotherapy and it meant kristian had to stay in hospital for a complete month it took a lot out of him
7890589 but the facilities over there are incredible when the patients are feeling well enough they can play pool and use the hi fis and televisions it is like a youth club
7890590 the staff are fantastic and encourage patients and parents to use their first names kristians consultant kevin windebank was just amazing
7890591 stacey and myself were able to stay over there is a place called crawford house along with the parents whose children were going through the same thing
7890592 albert has no head for heights but he was determined to do this along with paris they raised almost 2 000 and i just joined in at the last minute
7890593 kristians school pals have been wonderful through all of this as have aspatria rugby union club where he was a member of the under 16 team before his illness
7890594 the club have been in touch on a regular basis and they organised for him to go on a trip to sale sharks with them he came back with a signed shirt
7890595 we are now waiting to see how kristian got on in his gcses because he wants to do a joinery course at carlisle college next term hes really keen
7890596 we organised a huge get together at the silloth street social club in carlisle and charged 5 for tickets we then organised a raffle
7890597 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7890598 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7890599 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7890600 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7890601 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7890602 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7890603 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7890604 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7890605 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states

7890634 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7890635 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7890636 at this difficult time management are continuously monitoring the boiler situation and are keeping the workforce and union representatives informed
7890637 we are working together to try and minimise the impact upon our employees and hope to resume production as soon as possible
7890638 although difficult for all concerned this course of action will help safeguard the future of the plant and the company will strive to minimise the impact on our workforce
7890639 on a more positive note we continue to invest in the carlisle plant with the installation of 10 new large presses and the upgrade of some building machines to increase our capacity in large tyres
7890640 we have had some voices of concern from shopkeepers the vitality of penrith project has tried to address these to offset any kind of disruption to roads and ensure the normal patterns of trade are kept open
7890641 we are aware we have got a big development in the town but we have got the things in the town centre to attract people in
7890642 we are supporting local businesses during this period with a short term marketing campaign and by investing in the vitality of penrith groups objectives of promoting the town centre improving the look of the town and developing more events to attract and add value
7890643 we wanted to give something back because they did so much for kristian and ourselves nothing was too much trouble for them
7890644 we have at least 1 000 to donate and we dont know whether they will spend the money on medical equipment or something for the young cancer patients there
7890645 ward 16 at the royal victoria hospital in newcastle is like a youth club within a hospital there are hi fis pool tables and all sorts to keep teenagers occupied
7890646 i had lumps in my neck for a long time and the doctor used a fancy word when i was diagnosed it was only when mum stated to cry i realised it was serious
7890647 but the treatment started so quickly that i did not have time to be worried about anything and all my family and its a big family kept urging me to be positive
7890648 i feel great now and im really looking forward to getting back on the rugby field i love the game and hopefully i can make the aspatria colts next season
7890649 i cant wait for the trip to florida some of my cousins visit every two or three years and they are always telling me how great it is the theme parks and the whole experience
7890650 all teenage cancers are rare and more aggressive than they are in adults but if you are to get a cancer this is the best one to get the recovery rate is so high
7890651 i think kristian maybe took the news better than we did as parents he was very matter of fact about it although i suspect deep down he was not so calm
7890652 he was worried about two things one was losing his hair which he always gelled and the other was missing out on a family holiday to egypt that was planned
7890653 of course both things happened but we told him that there would be many more chances to have a holiday now that dream can come true for him
7890654 it was a very intensive course of treatment based on methods used in germany which have been very successful
7890655 it involved the use of steroids combined with chemotherapy and it meant kristian had to stay in hospital for a complete month it took a lot out of him
7890656 but the facilities over there are incredible when the patients are feeling well enough they can play pool and use the hi fis and televisions it is like a youth club
7890657 the staff are fantastic and encourage patients and parents to use their first names kristians consultant kevin windebank was just amazing
7890658 stacey and myself were able to stay over there is a place called crawford house along with the parents whose children were going through the same thing
7890659 albert has no head for heights but he was determined to do this along with paris they raised almost 2 000 and i just joined in at the last minute
7890660 kristians school pals have been wonderful through all of this as have aspatria rugby union club where he was a member of the under 16 team before his illness
7890661 the club have been in touch on a regular basis and they organised for him to go on a trip to sale sharks with them he came back with a signed shirt
7890662 we are now waiting to see how kristian got on in his gcses because he wants to do a joinery course at carlisle college next term hes really keen
7890663 we organised a huge get together at the silloth street social club in carlisle and charged 5 for tickets we then organised a raffle
7890664 i was still in that stage in my life where i was doing whatever i could to prove i wasnt sick
7890665 i had to explain why i missed half of high school
7890666 life disrupted getting real about chronic illnesses in your twenties and thirties
7890667 never before have medicine and society had to contend with issues like the effects of caregiving on young marriages and relationships or seriously ill young adults having children on such a large scale but here we are
7890668 in some way complicate the already complex terrain that people in their 20s and 30s must navigate
7890669 this is supposed to be the point in your life when everything comes together not when everything falls apart
7890670 if you really love someone that much how could you ask that person to go through all of this
7890671 thinking of your life stresses me out i cant do this
7890672 no matter what we do or how good we are at being patients
7890673 who wants to be labeled as the sick one especially when the leap from sick to not as productive or unreliable isnt too difficult to make for people who dont understand the nature of chronic illness
7890674 i would love if this book got people talking on a larger scale

7890678 i dont have any idea if thats the last thing he ever played on
7890679 it very well could be if it was ill treasure it like nothing else ive ever done

7890699 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a toss up in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start

7890702 the treatment the victims families received was never one of sympathy or sorrow mayor bloomberg never gave a public apology about their mistakes no new york politician ever gave their support to help us had they treated us a little differently maybe my decision to hold out for the largest settlement possible would be a little different

7890708 we had just built this centre and we were still trying to commission everything else when we get the email through from dylans production company that he wants a leather reclining chair
7890709 so we went up to waters department store at the time and asked them to lend us a jade green leather chair for bob and put it in his dressing room
7890710 as it turned out bob was being stalked at the time by somebody so there was a high level of security backstage so he came in about five minutes before going on stage and probably spent about 30 seconds on this leather reclining chair
7890711 then he went on stage came straight off stage and was up mt ousley before the applause had even ended

7890723 any one who dares to say that there was armed confrontation with the army is complicit in what happened today

7890733 the engineers were aware of a potential risk with kimis engine
7890734 changing the engine on kimis car would have seen him start from far down the grid at a track where it appeared that overtaking was impossible
7890735 it proves its not enough to bring formula one to a street circuit in a fantastic location to produce spectacular racing
7890736 everyone close to you puts their arms on your shoulders to say you are number one but then suddenly when you have a difficult situation they laugh and say this is already finished
7890737 thats not the case with kimi hes the world champion we are a team and of course we will support everyone in the team and above all of course kimi

7890742 our core cast are from diverse ethnic backgrounds including french italian white south african white maltese danish white portuguese and swedish
7890743 most ethnic minority participants felt the media had a responsibility to reflect britains diversity across all genres and was failing to do so in three main ways by relying on tokenistic and stereotyped representation of characters by representing extreme and exaggerated characters and by failing to reflect the realities of contemporary ethnic minority culture all these shortcomings were attributed to some extent to the perceived lack of a representative power base within uk media
7890744 we recognise that the conditions for gay and lesbian people in iran and many other countries are such that some individuals are able to demonstrate a need for international protection we do not however accept that we should make the presumption that each and every asylum seeker who presents themselves as being of a particular nationality or sexuality regardless of their particular circumstances should automatically be allowed to remain in the uk with particular regard to iran current case law handed down by the asylum and immigration tribunal concludes that the evidence does not show a real risk of discovery of or adverse action against gay and lesbian people who are discreet about their sexual orientation
7890745 you only have to listen to people who were terrorised by the metropolitan police in the 1950s and 1960s to know that telling gay people to live discreetly is quixotic

7890766 una hora con 20 minutos para ver de la vanguardia a la retaguardia
7890767 durante todo el trayecto recibieron innumerables muestras de simpat a por parte del pueblo
7890768 todos los establecimientos comerciales continuaron abiertos en la confianza de que seg n se observaba no intervendr a la polic a
7890769 tanto de las aulas los auditorios y las explanadas escolares como de las calles plazas mercados cines caf s camiones urbanos y en general de todo aquel espacio p blico donde stos los estudiantes pudieran difundir las demandas consignas y utop as de protesta
7890770 la insurgencia estudiantil no fue m s una cl sica movilizaci n universitaria o polit cnica circunscrita s lo a los mbitos geogr ficos de los recintos escolares sino que se convirti en la m s importante rebeli n urbana del m xico posrevolucionario que hizo de la capital mexicana su principal centro de operaciones
7890771 no hubo agravio contra ninguna autoridad aunque fueron muy en rgicas las protestas en contra de corona del rosal de los jefes policiacos y de los granaderos

7890774 el 13 de agosto se realiza una manifestaci n en la que participan conjuntamente la unam y el ipn y que va desde el museo nacional de antropolog a hasta el z calo
7890775 aunque los manifestantes no realizan actos violentos a su paso ejercen una extrema violencia verbal y escrita las mantas y pancartas que llevan contienen lemas y pronunciamientos injuriosos como lo son tambi n los gritos porras y canciones que vierten a lo largo de todo el trayecto
7890776 enormes retratos de ernesto che guevara presiden la manifestaci n que entre sus pancartas lleva sic varias en contra de las olimpiadas pidiendo que no se celebren
7890777 prominentes directivos del partido comunista mexicano del movimiento de liberaci n nacional y de los grupos extremistas estudiantiles encabezan la manifestaci n en la que participan tambi n muchos maestros as como personas ajenas por completo a los centros de educaci n superior
7890778 entre los gritos m s frecuentes se encontraban sic el de nete pueblo y el de prensa vendida
7890779 aunque la manifestaci n fue injuriosa para las autoridades desde el principio hasta el fin pudo ser realizada con la mayor libertad y sin interferencia alguna de la fuerza p blica no cabe duda que la fuerza circunstancial aunque irreflexiva que tienen los actos de masas propici una exacerbaci n de los nimos de los manifestantes que empezaron sentirse due os de la calle
7890780 hizo que el movimiento estudiantil alcanzara un verdadero triunfo rebasando el marco en que las autoridades y las deformaciones noticiosas hab an querido encerrarlo

7890787 08 00 pedrero piensa redactar una protesta adem s le propuso a fernando solana una reuni n con el rector porque hay la obligaci n de protestar frente al vandalismo del estado como universitarios no pueden permitir esta violaci n de la autonom a si aceptan esto est n perdidos frente a la historia frente a los muchachos y frente a todo el mundo

7890790 una infracci n a los reglamentos de polic a una reyerta de poca monta entre dos escuelas que atrajo en su contra la m s desproporcionada injustificada y bestial de las represiones tuvo la virtud de desnudar de un solo golpe lo que constituye la esencia verdadera del poder real que domina en la sociedad mexicana el odio y el miedo a la juventud el miedo a que las conciencias j venes e independientes de m xico receptivas y alertas por cuanto a lo que en el mundo ocurre entraran a la zona de impugnaci n de ajuste de cuentas con los gobernantes y estructuras caducos que se niegan a aceptar y son incapaces de comprender la necesidad de cambios profundos y radicales
7890791 nuestro movimiento por ello no es una algarada m s esto deben comprenderlo muy bien las viejas generaciones cuyas mentes se obstinan en querer ajustar las nuevas realidades a los viejos esquemas obsoletos de su revoluci n mexicana de su r gimen constitucional de su sistema de garant as y otros conceptos vac os enga osos de contenido opuesto a lo que expresan y destinados a mantener y perfeccionar la enajenaci n de la conciencia colectiva de m xico a la hipocres a social y a la mentira que caracterizan al r gimen imperante

7890795 i wont have a mortgage defrauder on my team we paid him millions but it wasnt enough to satisfy his greed so buh bye
7890796 creo que estamos viviendo en un mundo en el que la crisis del capitalismo se ve acompa ada tambi n de la crisis de una alternativa en los movimientos de liberaci n por eso creo que traer a la memoria a un dirigente como salvador allende es muy importante porque nuestros referentes te ricos y pr cticos dif cilmente pueden ser libros o corrientes filos ficas
7890797 hay una distorsi n de la memoria que est muy vinculada a las formas de adaptaci n de quienes siguen usando corrientes ideol gicas y pol ticas mientras hacen exactamente lo contrario de lo que hicieron sus antecesores cuando no se atreven a destruir sus estatuas mutilan su memoria ah puede haber un ocultamiento deliberado como el caso de los socialistas entre comillas que est n gobernando chile del proyecto socialista de allende y un uso del lenguaje que se presta a distintos tipos de lectura e interpretaciones
7890798 allende libr un combate dificil simo por la democracia y el socialismo us todos los recursos jur dicos y pol ticos a su alcance no s lo nacionaliz la miner a del cobre sino la del hierro la del salitre y la del carb n expropi a los grandes latifundistas para entregar las tierras a los campesinos y al mismo tiempo logr un notable crecimiento de la actividad econ mica y social el desempleo baj a 3 por ciento y 99 por ciento de los ni os pudieron encontrar un lugar en la escuela todo ocurri enmedio de uno de los planes m s agresivos en la historia de las oligarqu as latinoamericanas y del imperialismo norteamericano
7890799 salvador allende fue un hombre profundamente humano un hombre de honor dijo lo que pensaba hizo lo que dijo
7890800 igual con sus actos las palabras en la historia de la cultura latinoamericana acab con la fraseolog a transfigur la persuasi n y la ret rica en figura exacta de la conducta el presidente allende dijo fidel castro en el acto p stumo que organiz el pueblo chileno no le fall a su pueblo chileno del mismo modo que el pueblo chileno no le fallar al presidente allende los revolucionarios chilenos no le fallar n al presidente allende y sobre todo escuchar n sus llamados a la uni n m s estrecha para llevar adelante la lucha libertadora que lo sepan que lo oigan que se les grabe profundamente chile volver a vivir tras un largo y doloroso amanecer
7890801 hay victorias que son derrotas puesto que su derrota fue su victoria porque hoy en d a l es un s mbolo del pensamiento universal mientras que pinochet adem s de ser un cad ver es un icono de la infamia
7890802 la ruptura que viene cr nica de una transici n catastr fica
7890803 ser a an malo que una transici n democr tica que por definici n es una ruptura pactada no culmine en una nueva constituci n
7890804 una transici n que no desemboca en una nueva legalidad no es una transici n es un cambio de autoridades o de partido pero no una transici n
7890805 la sociedad no est en el poder pero el poder tampoco est en el estado la concentraci n del ingreso produce invariablemente la concentraci n del poder pero ste ya no se encuentra esencialmente radicado en los poderes constituidos sino en instancias ajenas a la rep blica

7891023 sure post away id love hearing from people about their ideas because it gives me a chance to do some grade school math story problems you know if we can get people to think about problems theyd like to solve and ways that surplus land and buildings can be the answer to the equation well this is my idea of fun

7891034 household car and truck pollution accounts for 30 percent of californias global warming pollution the amount that californians drive is increasing faster than our population growth rate and we need to act now to offer people choices to drive less by limiting sprawl we can take a big bite out of californias greenhouse gas pollution s b 375 builds a strong foundation to help california meet our ambitious global warming reduction goals consumers will also save money by having more transportation alternatives during this era of rising gas prices
7891035 california did not invent sprawl but it made sprawl famous s b 375 for the first time turns the corner away from sprawl in an era of high gas prices and global warming the need for s b 375 is undeniable it will be the first bill in the nation to insert climate change into the transportation housing and land use equation make no mistake s b 375 is vital to meeting the promise of californias landmark climate change law a b 32 we will never achieve our greenhouse gas reduction goals or energy independence unless we stop encouraging sprawl and start locating housing closer to jobs because right now the number of miles that people drive is increasing almost twice as fast as the population growth

7891037 reforms are needed to ensure that indigenous peoples are better able to exercise their right of self determination within the framework of a brazilian state that is respectful of diversity
7891038 it is evident that indigenous peoples frequently do not control the decisions that affect their everyday lives and their lands even when their lands have been officially demarcated and registered because of invasions and mining by outsiders and other factors
7891039 while culturally rich indigenous peoples remain impoverished economically without sufficient power or opportunities to develop on a sustainable basis are continually suffocated by discrimination
7891040 a national campaign of education on indigenous issues and respect for diversity guided by the government in partnership with indigenous peoples and with the support of the news media would likely help build bridges of mutual understanding
7891041 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7891042 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7891043 sarada was depressed because she had a lot of pressure from her husband to send money her husband was very sick the money she was sending was all spent on medical costs she was very upset about this because she wanted the money for her children to go to school
7891044 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7891045 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
7891046 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
7891047 i was locked in for two days and they the employers did not give me food and water then after two days i wanted to run away the apartment was on the fifth floor i tried to go down using cable wires running along the wall of building the cable broke and i do not remember what happened afterwards
7891048 most deaths resulting from a building fall are failed attempts to escape
7891049 dont call this an embassy we have become a funeral parlor people die natural deaths accidents suicide when they try to run away accidents happen
7891050 when employers lock someone up inside a home they are committing a crime and the police should treat it as such

7891062 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7891063 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7891064 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7891065 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7891066 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7891067 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7891068 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7891069 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7891070 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7891071 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

7891204 to them i didnt have the right i wasnt like them
7891205 this is painful to watch my son waste away like this the hospital says the doctors are on strike demanding high salaries and there is nothing i can do for my son as i have no money to take him to a private doctor
7891206 so i just have to take him back home and buy painkillers as the nurses have advised i do not know what he is suffering from this time and we needed a doctor to diagnose what the problem is this time
7891207 all this is a reflection of the political system we have in the country everyone is on strike at any given time and things will not improve unless and until there is new leadership that will address the doctors concerns and those of other professionals in the country
7891208 as it is my son will die a painful death unless i find money to take him to a private doctor
7891209 we are just giving them painkillers as these are the only drugs available at the hospital since the strike started we have registered deaths which doctors could have dealt with if they were not on strike
7891210 it is cheaper to visit the traditional healers and under the circumstances there is no choice as private doctors are very expensive
7891211 the situation countrywide is that all doctors at all the countrys referral hospitals are on strike but we are negotiating with the government on a new package
7891212 at the moment i am not at liberty to disclose to you our demands because of a confidentiality clause in our dealings that we signed with our principals

7891231 i think its just a matter of getting into a full square position of engagement with the authorities in guinea to really take this forward in a way which is going to benefit the country in the dramatic way that it can

7891441 if it happens once it can happen again and it has happened before
7891442 they are treating everyone in the neighborhood like they are would be gang members
7891443 there is poverty and a lot of social problems in neighborhoods like montreal nord but instead of dealing with poverty like by giving money to community groups they give millions of dollars to cops
7891444 caravans of 10 or 15 police cars will come into the neighborhood all of a sudden and we feel very insecure because it seems like anything can happen from one moment to the next it makes us feel very intimidated to have so many police everywhere
7891445 they see a few young people and even if there are little kids around they approach them trying to intimidate or what are they looking for they are provoking things trying to take this to the next level
7891446 they kill people and theyre not even accused of any misdoing
7891447 so they get away with it thats what we call impunity and because of it they know they can kill people so they just keep on acting like they can do whatever they want
7891448 and things like this happen because the politicians are too afraid to control the police more and they will continue to happen if nothing happens to these cops
7891449 the cops investigate themselves and there are no accusations so we never really know what truly happened the cops are not even suspended
7891450 that such practices are common within the different police services in quebec
7891451 so it really sends a message that the city and the government are backing the police
7891452 even if they say they think about the family and all that but they really seem more upset that there was a riot than the fact that the cops killed an unarmed youth
7891453 i dont think he can lead montreal nord correctly because hes not listening to his people
7891454 if he was listening to his people maybe fredy villanueva would still be alive
7891455 these people want jobs houses families and are tired of police harassment
7891456 if you dont give them some options what are they going to do
7891457 the police are not here to help people theyre here to criminalize people and then they do things like killing people
7891458 this makes it so that everybody in the community feels alienated like they are being unjustly treated and thats one of the reasons why an explosion like the one we saw after the killing of fredy villanueva happened
7891459 a lot of police are good officers but they tolerate abuses by other police officers how come they dont say anything about that they ask the population to anonymously denounce criminals but then they let criminals in their own ranks
7891460 if we could respect the police the riot wouldnt have happened but right now
7891461 theres no trust no respect we know what happened that night and thats why we want change
7891462 if they dont stop police brutality and their answer to what happened is to put more police on the streets
7891463 then theres going to be more police brutality and more riots to come

7891549 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7891550 shes been an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy jackson and simon cowell offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist with kara by her side paula finally has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7891551 yeah girl power you know i am concerned about the audience and acceptance but time will tell
7891552 it became too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream especially when i realized that many of them have supported my career
7891553 that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7891554 they want to see if there is any interest there
7891555 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7891556 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7891557 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7891558 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7891559 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7891560 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7891561 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7891562 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7891563 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7891564 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7891565 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7891566 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7891567 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7891568 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7891569 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning

7891572 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7891573 i spent those 5 1 2 years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7891574 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes and thats what i know how to do
7891575 will not allow the spilling of the blood of the sons of iraq by granting open immunity
7891576 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7891577 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7891578 yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because i was watching the closing ceremony and my mind was still there
7891579 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7891580 i was holding it for three days to make sure its not a dream
7891581 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7891582 we expect prices for rio tintos major commodities to remain substantially above the long run trend in 2009
7891583 it was a great result and it keeps the pressure on bhp as it continues the chase
7891584 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7891585 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7891586 we gaan een twintigtal kilometer fietsen en een achttal kilometer wandelen door gemeenten van brussel vlaams en waals brabant
7891587 de bretel is een familiaal en sportief initiatief met als doel de verbintenis tussen brussel en haar hinterland te benadrukken om brussel en haar ruime periferie te promoveren als hoofdstad en fusieplek voor alle culturen van belgi
7891588 de bretel is geen tegen manifestatie maar een aanvulling van de gordel
7891589 de gordel promoveert de vlaamse taal en cultuur dat is een legitieme maar eenzijdige aanspraak het is geen weerspiegeling van de veel complexere en gediversifieerde sociologische werkelijkheid
7891590 we moeten een dynamische band proberen te verwezenlijken met de rand en brussel heeft als europese hoofdstad een enorme verantwoordelijkheid en een formidabele uitdaging om de europese gedachte te verwezenlijken hier en nu
7891591 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7891592 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7891593 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7891594 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7891595 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7891596 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7891597 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7891598 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7891599 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7891600 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7891601 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7891602 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7891603 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7891604 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7891605 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7891606 no one works for someone we all just work together
7891607 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7891608 a fish of any of a number of genera in the subfamily epinephelinae of the family serranidae in the order perciformes
7891609 there have been reports of them growing big enough to swallow a human bather
7891610 swallowing an ordinary open circuit scuba diver would need a throat that can expand to about 2 feet 0 61 m square
7891611 a newspaper reported a 396 8 pound grouper being caught off the waters near pulau sembilan in the straits of malacca on tuesday 15 january 2008
7891612 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7891613 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7891614 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team the guy still looks great he s a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7891615 right now its a fluid situation like a lot of our players dave tollefson alex morrow wallace gilberry he has some versatility he can line up in a lot of different spots just like all of those guys in the group
7891616 injuries are an unfortunate part of this game we lost three starters to broken legs last season so we know what kind of adversity injuries present when you lose a player like osi that means everybody else has to step up their game fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack as always we ll continue to research all of our options
7891617 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7891618 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7891619 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7891620 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7891621 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7891622 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7891623 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7891624 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7891625 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7891626 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7891627 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7891628 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7891629 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7891630 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7891631 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7891632 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7891633 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7891634 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7891635 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7891636 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7891637 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7891638 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7891639 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7891640 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7891641 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7891642 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7891643 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7891644 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7891645 we are pleased to be announcing our four millionth image
7891646 fotolia has since conception prided ourselves in bringing together top photographers and illustrators with a wide variety of media buyers we are thrilled to be able to spotlight the work of a fotolia photographer with our own milestone without our photographers we would not have had the success we have today as one of the worlds leading providers of high quality micro priced images
7891647 numerous studies support the strength of the human animal bond and the positive effects that pets and people have on each other
7891648 the partnership between kroger and nestle purina to develop this national contest and the four plus two tales for the pet lovers heart tv program provides what we believe to be an engaging peek into some of the most endearing stories of the human pet relationship and speaks to our shared respect for this relationship

7891655 i figured he was with his friends so i went to the car and planned on meeting him there
7891656 i was beginning to figure that he had a low spell so i went up to the policeman
7891657 i thought they were going to tell me that his blood sugar had gotten too low and that he was in the hospital
7891658 went to bring his hands up to catch his fall
7891659 he loved being the center of attention at sporting events especially when the jets were in buffalo

7891675 in pregnant women with pcos the increasing tissue resistance to insulin adds to the pre existing insulin resistance which may accompany the syndrome
7891676 this pathogenic mechanism could lead to hyperglycemia reflected in a higher incidence of gestational diabetes
7891677 however studies on the prevalence of gestational diabetes in women with pcos gave conflicting results probably because of the heterogeneity of studies conducted so far
7891678 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one

7891681 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7891682 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7891683 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7891684 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7891686 this is a planning took where all things are going
7891687 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7891688 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7891689 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7891690 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7891691 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7891692 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7891693 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7891694 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7891695 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7891696 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7891697 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7891698 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7891699 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7891700 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7891701 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7891702 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7891703 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7891704 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7891705 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7891706 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7891707 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7891708 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7891709 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7891710 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7891711 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7891712 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7891713 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7891714 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7891715 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7891716 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7891717 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7891718 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7891719 this is about productivity and efficiency mainly at the metropolitan end
7891720 we make no bones about the fact we do continue to see a leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising
7891721 streamlined with the production of some sections and special reports outsourced
7891722 both papers under a seven day roster to remove duplication
7891723 the only way to read it is that the sun herald becomes an independent paper in masthead only it effectively becomes a satellite of the herald

7891725 reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial
7891726 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7891727 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7891728 im locked in for next year but there is still some stuff to sort out
7891729 it annoyed me when i realised i had been accused of faking an injury to stay off the field
7891730 faking an injury is the worst slur you can have i wanted to get back out there but the coaching staff and doctor told me i couldnt i would have given anything to get back out on the field
7891731 the fact he has asked for a release this year to me ive got my doubts about franks commitment to the team
7891732 it is always difficult to deal with a player when you dont know whether or not he wants to be at the club
7891733 you dont know what to believe but as for monday night i have got to believe frank if he said he wasnt right to go back on then ive got to go with him on that
7891734 if anything comes up in general business well discuss it but at the moment neither is on the agenda
7891735 we wouldnt consider letting him go we havent received any concrete offer anyway
7891736 he hasnt said he is unhappy and hasnt come to me saying he is unhappy
7891737 currency has been a factor in the deterioration of our wine performance both from a financial perspective and from the impact a strengthening currency has had on the competitiveness of australian products in the main export markets
7891738 but we are where we are and in dealing with all of the issues we can see that we might have done better
7891739 but despite the things that weve done to shoot ourselves in the foot were still holding our share weve still got fantastic brands weve got wines that win medals we have to translate that into sales
7891740 my sister just got married and while i bought her a wedding present it was not as special as i wanted it to be so i ordered her a charm that read john amp debby july 7th 2005 with the image of wedding bells i have just been so very pleased with the charms i have bought from you thanks for making my sister s wedding gift so special
7891741 the ring and bracelet i gave to my wife were just beautiful thanks for making our anniversary so special
7891742 its a lot more fulfilling to be with a woman of some experience

7891788 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

7891810 i thought i was doing the best thing for her
7891811 breast milk is supposed to be an entire meal dessert and drinks included
7891812 i completely support breast feeding and i think breast milk is the perfect food and the healthiest way to nourish an infant
7891813 were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up they may start their lives vitamin d deficient and then all theyre getting is vitamin d deficient breast milk
7891814 so the worst scenario is the gas tank is empty and the car wont go you have rickets but at very low levels of gas the car doesnt perform very well and you start having intermittent loss of power and that sort of thing as a result you may not be forming enough bone during childhood
7891815 human milk is very low in vitamin d absolutely there is no question about that
7891816 historically speaking we probably got it from the sun but now were afraid of the sun and we dont go out as much
7891817 the tragedy of this is that when theyre young theyre building up bone for the rest of their life
7891818 those who had adequate vitamin d and calcium will slide down from the top of the mountain these kids will slide down from the middle
7891819 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
7891820 we have a condition that has no known cause and there is no cure and people are looking to us to provide them with answers
7891821 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
7891822 the parents feel like it is something that has happened to their children here
7891823 what were trying to do is find out if it is true that theres this alarming incidence
7891824 we dont have a blood test or a lab test to say you have autism so its somewhat subjective
7891825 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7891826 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7891827 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7891828 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world
7891829 but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7891830 just get the children into early intervention and trust us were trying to get an answer

7891888 because mgs4 was optimized for the ps3 it is probably not possible
7891889 if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know my future games wont be based on the hardware anymore
7891890 probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
7891891 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware
7891892 i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms

7891913 i was just there having fun and half the class wasnt there and then we had to go
7891914 no my friend wasnt there in the morning he had to come at night
7891915 the rise of the indo afghan empire c 1710 1780
7891916 the pathans themselves left no early contemporary literature they built no monuments and left no inscriptions in their own country therefore the historians must rely on stray and chance material available in the records the literature monuments and coins of the many dynasties and peoples whose path took them to the territories where the afghans now dwell
7891917 the record of these traditions and tribal tables is suggestive
7891918 under this interpretation even the bani israel story may reflect some part of the truth and at least indicate a cause for a belief which however unreasonable it is hard to shake
7891919 it is inconceivable that a conquering race such as the epthalites huns which left proved descendants down in india among the rajputs did not contribute also to the blood of the peoples of gandahara peshawar which was one of their headquarters
7891920 the family tree of ghurghusht qais third son is shorter and less attractive the kakars of zhob loralai and parts of sibi in baluchistan are a very large tribe and they have never been held high in the account whether in war or peace and are less anarchic
7891921 the first genuine and historical glimpse of the afghan and pathan peoples in their own country is given to us in the inimitable baburnama the memoirs of babur the first mughal emperor 1482 1530 prior to this the names ghaljis and lodhis was all that was heard in the chronicles
7891922 when we come to babur everything changes suddenly the curtain rises the footlights go up on the afghan scene that up to that moment has been shrouded in darkness
7891923 from the narrative it is likely that the change of plan was due to negotiations between babur and malik shah mansur usafzai negotiations which ended in baburs taking the maliks daughter in marriage
7891924 in other words baburs evidence taken on broad view does not conflict with the suggestion for afghan and pathan origins as set out earlier in this book
7891925 where they had emigrated from the west of indus in the 17th century
7891926 the protection granted to such parasites was not free however and had to be earned
7891927 the hamsayas received territories of their own land and could act as their buffers against outside encroachments
7891928 even the laws of hospitality will go down before the nurtured enmity bequeathed by blood feud
7891929 i believe that tribal movements have been very greatly exaggerated in the tribal traditions in my time i have seen a process of replacement of one tribe by another going peacefully on over a period of generation in the usafzai and mohammadzai territory known as maira in the north of samah
7891930 for some years however the gaduns continued to give trouble committing outrages of all kinds and raiding on the border they were blockaded coerced and fined they were implicated in attacks on malakand and chakdara posts but in the end they finally made submission and paid up the fines demanded of them
7891931 the pathan tribes who boasted they had never within memory yielded even to mughal or durrani had actually suffered defeat in open battle at the hands of unbelievers
7891932 that peshawar contains no architectural monuments of any value is due mainly to the devastation of 1823
7891933 the hatred of the sikh terror which they shared no doubt helped them to sink all jealousies and work together for the common end
7891934 as a people they have always been evilly notorious for their faithlessness lawlessness treachery and brutality so much so that the saying afghan be iman afghan is faithless has passed into a proverb among neighboring peoples and oddly enough is acknowledged by themselves to be a true count not only in their dealings with the stranger but among themselves too
7891935 i was 20 years old in 1847 and i met him more than once and i remember him well i was once in a jirga when he asked us if we would stand and fight with sikhs if he stood by us we swore we would there were tears in our eyes and a tear in abbott sahibs eye too we did he was our father there are no angrez like abbott sahib now we loved him
7891936 among the people of hazara he left a name which will not die
7891937 it is impossible to reflect on the tribal society without mention of nawab abdul qayyum khan
7891938 to look at he was magnificent who held his head splendidly
7891939 among the people of n w f p he will live for ever
7891940 year by year the pathans of n w f p became more conscious of a challenge an uplifting that called them to an expansion of the mind faintly dreamed of but never before realized the eyes of youth turned to wider horizon of ambition and employment he was outgrowing the trammels of tribalism and began to look with contempt on the introversions of kabul under durrani feudal
7891941 there is more honor to be won by the ruler beyond the indus than by the raider on the border
7891942 afghanistan is largely an ethnic mystery in the absence of written records makes tracing their ethnogenesis almost impossible in recent years scholars have begun to examen the afghan ethnic groups but anthropometric and serological evidence is still scanty and historic sources are fragmentary and inconclusive thus the question of afghans origin has evoked more controversy than consensus
7891943 no part of afghanistan has been subject to more speculative theories or requires more practical elucidation than this mountain region in which so large a share of the drama of afghanistan history has been played
7891944 the mythical character of the whole account is surely clear enough from what has been said even the story of the early conversion of qais and his companions can be disproved we shall see from reliable muslim sources including the traveler al biruni and the courtier al utbi both writing in the time of mahmud of ghazni early in the eleventh century a d these accounts establish that four centuries later than the time of qais the province of kabul had not been islamized and this was only achieved under the ghaznavids the hindu shahiya kingdom of jaipal extended almost to kabul and mahmud had to fight against infidel afghans of the sulaiman mountains even later than this in the great war of a d 1192 between the muslim invaders and the hindu kingdom of northern india the hindu ruler had assembled a force of afghan horsemen and there were afghans fighting on both sides there is thus more than an indication that even at the end of the twelfth century the sixth hijri all afghans had not been converted though the legends represent them as rushing into the fold in the days of khalid
7891945 the theory of jewish origin of pathans though ardently believed in by many pathan intellectuals does not stand a test of a scientific analysis the gap of 1700 years between qais and his ancestor king saul is supposed to have been filled in by 36 generations which does not appeal to reason the whole account of this theory is thus reduced to a legend pure and simple
7891946 israel appears to have blue eyes and among its characteristics red hair but there is no sort of proof of the claim nor its likely that one can ever be forthcoming also the name afghanistan was born in relatively modern times formerly it was known as kabulistan and khorasan
7891947 because they were a tribe of prestige and vigor and because they held some of the best part of what we now call afghanistan and because it was one of their chiefs who founded the afghan power calling it the durrani empire all the muslim tribes other than the turkish origin claim to be offshoots of the same race the story of the afghan tribes those who call themselves the ben i israel has been told and how many have tacked themselves on to a bogus genealogy because it was fashionable thing to do cis indus is the tract once famous as the black mountain and the scene of many expeditions to prevent its tribes raiding into the peaceful districts of hazara here the bulk of the clans all belong to the big subgroup of the izazai but with them three are non pathan origin known as gaduns the swatis of allai and the tanawals
7891948 as has already been said there are certain tribes which by location and association are commonly styled pathans but are not so in reality
7891949 a handbook of the fighting races of india by p
7891950 it is curious to find that swatis in hazara district describing themselves as pakhtuns and gaduns do the same though the only theory that they are perhaps connected with the kakar pathans is in my opinion rubbish they are not pathans at all in origin
7891951 the origin of the tribe gaduns or jaduns is not very clear but they certainly have no connection with the yusafzais among whom they dwell they claim descent from the family of ghurghusht but are more probably of rajput origin many of the descendants of jadu the founder of rajput dynasty emigrated from gujrat some eleven hundred years before christ to the hills of kabul and kandahar when they moved to mahaban range the tribe crossed the indus into hazara these have however lost all connection with their trans frontier tribesmen and are to all intents and purposes punjabis
7891952 the trans frontier clans contain about 2000 fighting men they do not enlist freely nor are they in request being considered to be of smaller fighting value than other pthans the trans indus gaduns are bounded by the utmanzais by amazais the tribesmen are all cultivators or cattle owners
7891953 about two thirds of the original utmanzai territory is now occupied by the gaduns who in old days were invited to cross the indus as mercenaries and were given in requital the lands they now hold on the western and southern slopes of mahaban mountain
7891954 this tribe is especially illustrious as the representative of buddha the founder of buddhist religion whose direct descendants are always regarded as yadus the original name has become strangely corrupted and the race is now seldom designated as yadu or yaduvana but commonly by the term jadu or jadun or jadubansi
7891955 the utman division of mandanr occupies the southern slopes of mahaban mountains on the west bank of the indus jointly with the gadun or jadun tribe these gadun represent the great yadu tribe their name became the patronymic of the descendants of buddha a progenitor of lunar race
7891956 those who try to identify the pathans exclusively with the jews or the aryans or the greeks or the white huns are not rationalists they base their opinions mostly on traditions and legends which cannot stand a scientific analysis the habitat of pathans is located such that all the foreign invaders of india pass through it leaving behind stragglers and deserters who settled permanently and thus mingled their blood with that of those among whom they lived the fact is that the pathans are the finished product of racial intermingling extending over three thousand years they have thus become a hybrid race and the distinction between afghan and pathanas made by caroe neither appeals to common sense nor conforms to the beliefs held by all the pashto speaking people
7891957 gaduns about 10 000 on the banks of indus although some speak pashto they can no longer be considered as pashtoon tribe
7891958 ceos tell people all the time that they value integrity a good way to walk the walk is have integrity on salaries
7891959 a major concern from a management perspective is that an employee goes from being unhappy to becoming a true villain
7891960 in a worst case scenario an employee may actually try and sabotage others by spreading rumors not sharing important work related information and engage in other problem behaviors
7891961 payscale takes it to the next level its very scientific
7891962 by working together to offer an inside look at companies we can open access and bring greater transparency to information in one of the most important parts of our lives our work
7891963 the best way for employees to handle a perceived inequity in salary is to gather market data on what similar positions make in other organizations and make a thoughtful and rational performance based argument on why they should be closer to or even exceed the salary of their peers
7891964 the excitement surrounding the sport of swimming is undoubtedly at an all time high
7891965 we absolutely expect that this sort of excitement and exposure will translate to membership growth at our clubs across the nation the performances by our olympic athletes were awe inspiring and nbc did a wonderful job of sharing those performances with a national audience we are confident that those factors will inspire thousands to take up the sport
7891966 we have been hearing from our member clubs across the country since the completion of swimming in beijing and they are seeing the effects already
7891967 the clubs we have spoken with tell us that their phones have been busy all month and that trend is being mirrored across the country
7891968 we knew we set some high goals but after seeing the numbers at our try outs weve got a real good shot at the 25 30 mark
7891969 we held our try outs at the beginning of a tropical storm and we still had record numbers i think its not just what michael phelps did but all of the publicity and coverage that the sport got and the positive image that the swimmers projected that are sparking so much interest
7891970 we came back from vacation and i had more than 30 voicemail messages
7891971 i was kind of surprised since we havent even started our recruiting campaign were going to have to try to make room for all these new swimmers
7891972 as a coach for the spokane area swimming team for the last 20 years and also an employee of the ymca of the inland northwest ive seen first hand the impact the olympics have had on interest in competitive swimming michael phelps performance has kids excited about swimming competitively but ive also noticed that adults are swimming and exercising more it seems that dara torres philosophy of age is just a number is inspiring many adults to train and get in shape at any age

7891975 star wars the clone wars brings an entirely new look and feel to star wars by moving it into animation we wanted to use technology that would live up to the high standards of lucasfilm and selected autodesk maya as our animation platform for both the film and tv series we chose maya for its creative tools extensibility and large user base maya is the backbone of our global production environment enabling us to seamlessly share work between our united states based creative team and our production studios in asia

7892002 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7892003 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7892004 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity

7892006 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7892007 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could

7892031 we were on a cross country ride in karachi when one of our company the daughter of a german diplomat fell into a bog with her horse
7892032 there were 40 of us we all stood around stunned except for this one man asif ali zardari who jumped in and pulled out the girl and then the horse as well
7892033 during all this time he could have drowned at any time himself

7892101 convoquen sus asambleas y elijan a los delegados y a partir de ese momento es cuando ya empezaremos a vislumbrar alg n resquicio de luz sobre el candidato o candidata que podamos apoyar
7892102 global de la situaci n en la que se encuentra la federaci n y sobre todo porque ya se acerca el pr ximo congreso y nosotros tenemos cosas que opinar como est n opinando tambi n otras plataformas de candidatos aunque nosotros no tengamos candidato
7892103 no nos vamos a decidir por ning n candidato espec fico porque eso supondr a alterar o vulnerar las normas de funcionamiento de nuestro partido
7892104 tenemos que respetar la voluntad de las agrupaciones y la elecci n de los delegados
7892105 cuando est n todos los delegados elegidos es cuando realmente vamos a ver qu posibilidades tienen los precandidatos que se han presentado
7892106 si tuviera un candidato es posible que tuviera problemas y conflictos porque unos estar an por ese candiato y otros no
7892107 como no hay nada que repartir no puede haber conflicto
7892108 que pueden tener sus gustos por unos o por otros pero todos los que componen esta plataforma van a respetar los tiempos y la legalidad de nuestro partido

7892111 seguir trabajando en crear un dise o com n en la manera de ser y trabajar de un partido como punto de inicio para la b squeda del mejor candidato para llevarlo adelante
7892112 debe prevalecer la uni n de todos los socialistas porque el objetivo final es hacer frente a un pp en el horizonte de 2011
7892113 se comienza a trabajar creando una estructruta de partido que sea m s fiel a la realidad valenciana aglutine a todos y sea capaz de sacar lo mejor entre los mejores para poner fin a la bancarrota el descr cito y el despilfarro del pp

7892140 the national executive of the acc is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of the medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
7892141 michael guglielmucci has not been a paid staff member of edge church for eight years
7892142 michael has lived in three other states of australia since leaving us and has been a minister on staff in two other churches since leaving our employ
7892143 he has not received any money from edge church international toward his alleged medical expenses
7892144 michaels lawyer has written to the police commissioner advising him of all pertinent information and notifying him of michael guglielmuccis intention to fully co operate with police inquiries

7892153 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
7892154 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
7892155 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus

7892183 when you hear that sound you should hold still until you see where it is coming from then back away slowly they strike if they are cornered given a chance they will go away be careful about large flat rocks snakes like to lie out to get themselves warm and never ever put your hands or your feet into a place where you cant see in

7892187 it is extremely difficult to see how the cost of employing 36 video journalists in scotland can be justified
7892188 weve always been going by the old school thing of picking a guy and sticking with him and getting him ready in the pre season you have the luxury of getting quarterback a lot of reps but when youre limited on the number of days you have to get ready for the next opponent i think it is extremely important to get one guy more reps than the other guy because you plan on him playing
7892189 thats what i was so happy about friday night it was the best weve tackled its the best weve run to the ball we got a lot of people to the ball and gang tackled defensively

7892201 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the world cup i was not too pleased i thought that will not happen again
7892202 i am confident that we will do well because our sevens team has been together for quite a while now its going to be hard work for everybody the competition will be very tight
7892203 but again that is the challenge for all the teams that will be at the qualifiers

7892207 cpj calls on both the transitional government and the islamic courts union to adhere to their public statements to do everything possible to ensure the safe release of these media workers
7892208 prudence is required in somalia where the situation is complex and journalists and humanitarian aid workers are often abducted by militias acting with very diverse motives
7892209 we might have decided it the other way around if wed been the trial court but we cant say the trial court was outright insane to decide as it did
7892210 die zusagen die sie uns angeboten haben waren nicht ausreichend

7892221 in den jahren vor der finanzkrise war es kontinuierlich m glich neue anleihen zu platzieren derzeit sind transaktionen dagegen st rker von einer g nstigen nachrichtenlage abh ngig
7892222 die zeitfenster in denen man anleihen platzieren kann sind k rzer und seltener geworden

7892225 gro e hochzins oder hybridanleiheemissionen wird es vorerst sicherlich nicht geben
7892226 die mehrzahl der neuen bonds haben derzeit laufzeiten zwischen drei und f nf jahren das spricht f r eine gewisse risikoscheu

7892234 our new album hit the charts it is now also released in
7892235 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7892236 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7892237 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

7892254 the creation of a uniform national industrial relations system for the private sector is a critical economic reform for our nations future
7892255 will rely upon all of the constitutional powers available to it in government to legislate national industrial relations laws
7892256 i hope mr della bosca will be in a position sooner rather than later to resume his office and bring to bear the undoubted leadership experience and influence that he has hitherto displayed in the negotiations with the commonwealth about the future shape of the industrial relations system in his absence there may be a natural tendency for the commonwealth to feel less inclined to pay regard to states interest

7892259 i was using sir donald as an example in which the distinction was almost negated so great did his power of choice seem to be
7892260 if ever a character was a real life walter mitty it was him
7892261 but sir donald didnt just dream about winning anything he actually did it in any sport he put his mind to
7892262 and then challenged lindrum to a return encounter and matched him

7892286 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7892287 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7892288 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7892310 the city continues to be concerned with remaining a city of diversity and of an implicit desire for openness without detriment to its concern with its genuinely original features this is clear from many aspects of its appearance that need not be indicated but in some way can be appreciated in particular from its windows there are windows of various patterns sizes forms and shapes windows inspired by several cultures and civilisations windows created by architects from a range of eras and of various nationalities while wandering in the markets of jerusalem i come across islamic architecture with its certain influences from persian architecture and with its ayyubid mamluke and ottoman references i come across roman and byzantine architecture and medieval and modern european i observe an architecture that encompasses certain secular dimensions concerned with the features of the city and its ability to embody delight and joy in the meantime i observe an architecture that encompasses certain religious dimensions meant to inspire awe in peoples souls and make them feel they are weak creatures in need of a creator who will extend a helping hand to them and guide them to the straight path
7892311 given the overall adverse environment of the industry i am pleased with the results for the current quarter
7892312 our fresh pork operations and our packaged meats business performed well in the face of sharply rising input costs we are continuing to focus closely on our cost structure and improving plant operating efficiencies also our new management structure is in place and moving forward nicely
7892313 the volatile nature of both the domestic and world markets for meat prices and grains combined with uncertainty surrounding the economy and the us dollar make any prediction of future results very difficult
7892314 de omzetting zal in de ochtend van 27 augustus worden doorgevoerd downtime is daarbij onvermijdelijk maar dit zal niet langer dan een kwartier duren

7892317 the big wall street firms are finally coming clean about the collapse of the auction rate securities market now that new york attorney general andrew cuomo and other regulators have put a gun to their heads the truth is even uglier than i suspected as regular readers know i was among the victims ive since heard from hundreds of others wall streets reaction was to offer to lend investors their own money using our other assets as collateral and charging us market rates it was insult on top of injury thanks to a wave of subpoenas lawsuits or threatened lawsuits and the prospect of disclosure three of the biggest sellers of auction rate securities agreed last week to reimburse clients those firms said they will buy back a total of nearly 40 billion in the securities a sum that while large can indeed be absorbed by their balance sheets whats really shocking are the allegations and evidence that some executives may have known that the auction rate market was about to collapse even as they pressed their brokers to push the product on unsuspecting clients katrina byrne a spokeswoman for ubs responded we catagorically reject any claim that the firm engaged in any widespread campaign to move auction rate securities inventory from our own books into private client accounts as for the emails she said we were disappointed the new york attorney general released details on certain transactions when we conducted our own internal investigation with the assistance of external counsel we found no evidence of unlawful conduct by any employees
7892318 the gnudi are only made by a privileged few and nobody can even be in the vicinity so as to keep the recipe secret
7892319 its not surprising when you consider where the spending power lies when it comes to fashion photography these girls are the best there are its not surprising clients come back to them
7892320 logic and over analysis can immobilise and sterilize and idea its like love the more you analyse it the more it disappears

7892323 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
7892324 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000

7892328 we will deal with jews in accordance with our ethics religious teachings and historical values
7892329 jews lived freely and ran prosperous businesses in egypt and baghdad and the markets of baghdad are evidences of what the jews owned
7892330 this song is great fun and good for western swing dancing
7892331 but it also contains a bit of a message for folks who may often burn the candle at both ends
7892332 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7892333 this far reaching programme will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7892334 there will also be a wide range of initiatives to significantly reduce costs in all departments across the business including deferral of wage reviews for senior management the company said
7892335 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission we reject that
7892336 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7892337 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year
7892338 its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand

7892342 melissa dont let your mouth overload your hardware sit tight and serve your community fairly the real diarrhea is the way you want that committee to be more than what it is settle down and do your civic duty and maybe later you can serve on a board with real teeth that makes real changes for brownsville
7892343 from delivering on our election commitments to moving forward with the new reform agenda for the nations future
7892344 the creation of a uniform national industrial relations system for the private sector is a critical economic reform for our nations future
7892345 will rely upon all of the constitutional powers available to it in government to legislate national industrial relations laws
7892346 i hope mr della bosca will be in a position sooner rather than later to resume his office and bring to bear the undoubted leadership experience and influence that he has hitherto displayed in the negotiations with the commonwealth about the future shape of the industrial relations system in his absence there may be a natural tendency for the commonwealth to feel less inclined to pay regard to states interest
7892347 she was in shock in a state of great anguish
7892348 to paraphrase groucho marx i dont want to play puerto rico with anyone else who wants to play puerto rico
7892349 it can present serious difficulties for the decennial census program
7892350 our cyclical budget needs to serially increase in the years leading up to the decennial censuses and difficulties most often come up in years ending in nine and zero
7892351 a continuing resolution that freezes our budget would make it very difficult for the census bureau
7892352 were under a presidential mandate to get those agents hired
7892353 and were confident we can get it done in 2007 we operated under a continuing resolution for a while and we still managed to hire at a high rate
7892354 so if we have a continuing resolution through the inauguration and then some sort of omnibus appropriations passed in a reasonable fashion thereafter we wont have any problems with construction
7892355 were planning for it were holding regular staff meetings and going through and identifying our must spend dollars and what can wait
7892356 and its not like were going to push a button on oct 1 these projects dont start immediately
7892357 la justicia es como las serpientes s lo muerde a los descalzos

7892359 un d a estaba hablando con una amiga karen juglar ella escribe poes a y me sugiri que el contenido se prestaba para que jugara con la forma y que ser a interesante como libro y como objeto me empez a dar muchas alternativas de c mo podr a trabajar el libro alrededor de la idea hasta que surgi la idea de las pastillas
7892360 dosis es un ejercicio de sanaci n propia uno pasa ciertos procesos y es tratar de dar a la gente la dosis peque ita de lo que me ayud a m a sanarme no es un serm n es de a poquito es desarmarte en un poema incluso el efecto puede ser desgarrador para el lector
7892361 la vida tiene problemas como la depresi n la gente no est bien emocionalmente vivimos entre pastillas
7892362 a veces lo que duele es lo que cura el libro es como un electrocardiograma son poemas que pesan no todo puede ser rosa pero me parece que en gran parte podr a tomarse como una reacci n a muchos cambios sociales la gente busca algo no sabe qu es pero lo est buscando por todas partes
7892363 he visto c mo suceden peque os y grandes milagros quiz s padezco de una fe que no se quita

7892368 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7892369 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7892370 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7892371 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7892372 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7892373 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7892374 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7892375 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7892376 they were given a chance to retract their statements and to apologise a total of 25 have already withdrawn the statements and one resigned
7892377 what i am saying is that we have actually met the legal requirements all the time
7892378 it is self evident that employees will be exposed the more important issue is whether that exposure is harmful
7892379 we say you are in gross violation of the law we are here to show that you are in contempt of the law
7892380 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and get out to an early lead
7892381 i knew that was a hard double for ryan in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
7892382 you were under world record pace at the 50 why so aggressive
7892383 id be glad to answer your questions if you have anything halfway intelligent and not insanely rude to ask
7892384 man you either underestimated the competition or didnt train properly why has everything fallen apart for you
7892385 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7892386 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7892387 this is a good price given consideration for the current softening in oil prices the turbulence on global stock markets and the geopolitical stage
7892388 i would be amazed if there was not some form of onward sale
7892389 the records of important cases that came before his court are said to be much complicated because of his continued absence
7892390 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24

7892401 montana wyoming colorado kansas oklahoma arizona and new mexico all have democratic governors and all are democratic governors who succeeded republicans many of them have been re elected in heavily republican states
7892402 they have governed to a group of people who want leadership and want change to take this country forward in a differentway
7892403 what people need to understand about barack obama is his history
7892404 he is the son of a mother from kansas he is the grandson of a soldier from world war ii who marched across europe here is a son of a father from kenya who came to america looking for freedom
7892405 so when you put all the different elements of barack obama together and you see the choices hes made in life he is the kind of servant leader like bill ritter he is the kind of servant leader we need in the white house he is not going to be beholden to anyone
7892406 what you have seen in this part of the us is why barack obama is here today we are not afraid to talk about issues in colorado
7892407 and race is not as big an issue here as in other parts of the country
7892408 the more people get to know barack obama the more they like him people of montana colorado new mexico arizona all these states are very much up for grabs the west is a battleground
7892409 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7892410 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7892411 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7892412 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7892413 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7892414 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7892415 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7892416 president clinton understands this is senator obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make senator obama our next president

7892447 mut cannot afford to be relegated into a theatre of drama and bad publicity anymore after the deplorable demonstrations led by ifp aligned hooligans which led to the closure of the university early this year
7892448 we need to look at governance at the university as there are some discrepancies that we have picked up
7892449 we asked that the vice chancellor take leave while these issues are investigated
7892450 the inquiry will look into among other things the benefits payable by the university to the vice chancellor
7892451 unser ziel ist die integration der rund 4200 besch ftigten anfang 2009

7892453 templates may be defined for a service to describe metadata about the service in general
7892454 if name or type is omitted it acts like a wildcard
7892455 this funtion will return a string containing scf tmpl wildcard
7892456 the caller is responsible for freeing the out buffer on success
7892457 the scf tmpl pg target function will retrieve the property groups target as currently templated
7892458 the template validation functions offer a way to validate an fmri
7892459 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7892460 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7892461 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7892462 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7892463 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7892464 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7892465 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7892466 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7892467 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7892468 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7892469 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7892470 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7892471 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7892472 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7892473 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7892474 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7892475 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7892476 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7892477 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7892478 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7892479 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7892480 who are open to doing something on the production side
7892481 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7892482 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7892483 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7892484 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7892485 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7892486 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7892487 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7892488 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7892489 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7892490 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7892491 they got hold of a safe and took it with them after forcing the domestic worker to show them where it was the men fled the scene in three cars
7892492 he had a big heart and was there for people when they needed him and then on the other side he was a completely funny guy
7892493 as for his personality all that i can say is hes one in a million
7892494 he didnt suffer he didnt have breathing problems it was just his time
7892495 the army has done everything possible and is answering my questions but its just hard for me to understand why he just collapsed
7892496 celebrities like linsday lohan are merely gay for play and are attempting to cash in on the faddish appeal of lesbianism without any commitment to our cause
7892497 we could have easily have spent 20 000 to hire a firm to validate the original design but we thought it would be nice to get some of our own engineering students involved in helping us solve a real problem at their alma mater

7892521 while we hope that a crisis or emergency will never occur at uncg the university has made emergency preparedness a priority
7892522 while still falling these are far less than the 2 2 5 percent monthly drops seen earlier in 2008
7892523 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7892524 nevertheless not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20 0 percent
7892525 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7892526 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7892527 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7892528 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7892529 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7892530 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7892531 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7892532 and i said to myself something is going on here
7892533 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7892534 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7892535 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7892536 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7892537 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7892538 especially toward the end of the month i get a lot of e mails from women and theyre pretty desperate
7892539 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7892540 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7892541 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
7892542 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7892543 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
7892544 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7892545 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
7892546 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7892547 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7892548 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7892549 people who work the day shift kiss their kids goodnight and head out for the night shift
7892550 cmere you dumb motherfuckers its okay barack obama wont boil you in a pot or give your devalued houses to black people and by the way i dont hate america
7892551 while not a groundswell of optimism it is encouraging that confidence did not continue to falter and even rose modestly
7892552 a pause in the overall downward trend in consumer confidence is a welcome sign but confidence continues to be soft as we head into the important fall season for retailers

7892554 when i was young you had to climb a coconut tree to see the sea
7892555 every year the sea comes closer we keep moving the village and we are being pushed down to the lagoon
7892556 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7892557 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7892558 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7892559 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 34 celsius and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7892560 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7892561 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7892562 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7892563 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7892564 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7892565 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7892566 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
7892567 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
7892568 i used to work as day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
7892569 we will beat terrorism and al qaeda we will not abandon our work
7892570 if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaeda would take full control over our area
7892571 she was in shock in a state of great anguish
7892572 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7892573 of particular note was the groups ability to manage its expenses which grew at an inflation beating seven percent
7892574 because i have a big front yard and id say go for it youre welcome
7892575 the victim was playing with a revolver spinning the cylinder placing it to his neck and then pulling the trigger

7892577 thats one game you do not want because i mean youre taking your life in your own hands and i would urge anybody in the world weapons guns are not something to play with
7892578 completely rejecting plato means that one thinks like nietzche and heidegger and the nazis who really thought there was such a thing a jewish physics and aryan physics and the two could be different which was the usual way of thinking about it pre plato
7892579 another tenet of this cult is moral relativism they believe there is no absolute truth or source of right and wrong each person must determine what is right or wrong for himself

7892588 i am totally psyched about this mozilla is a new kind of foundation one with participation transparency and innovation at its very roots its not just about giving out grants or making bold statements although these are useful things to do but also about getting large numbers of people involved in making things in particular things that make the internet more open for someone obsessed with reinventing how foundations work there could be no more exciting job than this

7892593 basicamente antes da confer ncia de annapolis realizada em novembro o processo de paz e as conversas estavam completamente paralisadas desde 2001

7892642 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
7892643 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7892644 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7892645 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7892646 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7892647 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7892648 la decisi n que ha tomado el club seguro que va a ser para dar un pasito m s de cara a que los canteranos est n bien amarrados
7892649 un club como este con un modelo nico se tiene que consolidar para seguir creciendo si queremos que no vuelva a pasar que equipos como el liverpool o el tottenham vengan a quitarnos futbolistas con mucho futuro en relaci n a mikel san jos y yuri berchiche el club tiene que retenerlos haci ndoles contratos para que no salgan y eso lo tiene que hacer un club saneado
7892650 en el mundo del f tbol al final las cosas son como son el club tiene que gestionar sus recursos econ micos tienen que tomar decisiones desde el sentido de qu es lo mejor y como hombre de club creo que esta decisi n va a suponer dar un pasito m s para que canteranos est n bien amarrados

7892657 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7892658 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7892659 imagine being able to create any 3d object you want a lego piece you are missing
7892660 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7892661 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7892662 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7892663 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7892664 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7892665 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7892666 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7892667 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7892668 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7892669 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7892670 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7892671 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7892672 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7892673 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7892674 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7892675 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7892676 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7892677 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7892678 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7892679 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7892680 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7892681 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7892682 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7892683 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7892684 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7892685 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

7892689 it is not a matter that causes me any concern at all
7892690 the established process for standing controllers down after an incident of that type was not followed
7892691 the consensus in the room was that expediency had taken precedence over the established procedure
7892692 both controllers were removed from from the console and discussed the matter with the traffic manager and the check and standardisation supervisor it was assessed that the controllers responded appropriately to correct the situation and the controllers therefore resumed normal duties
7892693 the staffing shortage is the root cause of these problems whether it be closures of airspace or an inability to stand people down
7892694 they know about having to do two weeks quarantine there first and possibly three weeks here
7892695 what we need to do now is find out which horses want to come and for what race and they wont know that for another week or two
7892696 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7892697 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal party or the nationals any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys

7892703 the right to determine whether or not we are given access to a number of sensitive documents related to the arms deal
7892704 if godi decides in the mistaken belief that he has the power to do so to stop me from seeing these documents he can rest assured that i will address the matter directly with the speaker and following that consider all other options
7892705 godi has no right to determine whether or not a fellow member of parliament is allowed access to these documents a number of former and current members of scopa have previously accessed these documents without the permission of the scopa chair but rather with the assent of the speaker of parliament
7892706 i did so in the belief that these documents may well expose possible wrongdoing associated with the arms deal or at the very least point the way to doing so

7892711 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7892712 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7892713 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7892714 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7892715 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7892716 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7892717 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7892718 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7892719 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7892720 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7892721 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7892722 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7892723 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7892724 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7892725 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7892726 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7892727 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7892728 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7892729 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

7892731 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7892732 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7892733 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7892734 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7892735 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7892736 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7892737 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7892738 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7892739 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7892740 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7892745 ive heard you are also going to a far country i am going to prague in the czech republic the package im going to carry is five times my size by the way my name is snail pace but you can call me pacer
7892746 prague they say its a charming city pacer i know going to the old town is like jumping into a fairy tale with magnificent and magic old castles ghost stories and everything one day id like to see prague astronomical clock i know it dates back to 1410 and was one of the complex astronomical clocks designed and constructed during the 14 centuries soon after the invention of the mechanical clock
7892747 i see you have done your homework at snail mail school how long have you been working at snail mail
7892748 let me tell you that im terribly excited ive heard amazing stories from the other snails
7892749 i bet youve heard many fantastic stories ive been working for snail mail for some years now i have to admit that its not the same as it used to be before e mail things have changed but we still get to travel from time to time carrying interesting packages in some cases full of illusions and dreams i could tell you plenty extraordinary tales from my travels theres a lot to learn out there lots of marvelous places to see and interesting creatures to meet
7892750 im sure you have plenty of fabulous adventures to tell pacer my trip will be to the south of france there is a place called nice and ive heard its very nice funny name for a city isnt it actually i volunteered for this trip it seems like no snails were willing to take this parcel to france it has to be for the long way i suppose as the parcel itself is quite small im sure theres a lot to be seen between north germany and the south of france ive heard there are beautiful landscape outstanding old buildings and breathtaking natural wonders im waiting to get the stamp on my package then im off
7892751 the first thing you have to learn slugger is that the city youre going to visit is pronounced like the english word niece not like the word nice
7892752 i know i learned that in the training course i just like to make fun of the name of the city thats all
7892753 thats good to know see not all of us are so lucky to go where we want to go you know but what we learn on the journey is more important than the journey itself you have to start the journey with some basic knowledge and then build up your knowledge as you travel that will give you a good insight about what life is about i go to prague this time and it seems to be a cold place in winter although beautiful as you have said any place can be cold if you have a cold heart you can only feel the warmth of a place if you have a warm heart and the wisdom to see and feel the warmth of the place even though a place can be said to be cold in appearance when it is not everything depends on the eye of the beholder youd better take care out there france can be nice and warm but you can end up on a plate in a cool restaurant there are restaurants where only snails are offered as starters they call us escargots its a funny name isnt it
7892754 oh come on dont scare me you are just jealous youd love to go in my place wouldnt you
7892755 jealously is not a good feeling to start with my young friend in addition to answer to your question finishing my days being served in a french restaurant after having been cooked in garlic butter doesnt lure me i prefer to travel safe to the lands where i know there is no risk for me
7892756 you think too much pacer look at me i dont worry about anything i dont even think of all those philosophical and metaphysical things youre always talking about im happier than you are im sure about that why do you have to think so much
7892757 why do i think too much you ask to see the true nature of the world to understand the universe and our lives here to give meaning to my existence however you will never understand those things you are happy in your world as simple as it is and i wont change that remember to learn as much as you can on the journey i just hope to see you safe and sound back in germany in a couple of monthstime

7892852 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7892853 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7892854 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7892855 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7892856 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7892857 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7892858 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7892859 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

7892861 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

7892870 once the cookie was stuffed on the users computer by one or more of the defendants any future revenue actions initiated by that user when the user later visited ebay intentionally and not as a result of any advertisement places by defendants appeared to be eligible for commissions payable to one of the defendants
7892871 despite knowing about the many legal troubles of pay by touchs founder chairman and one time ceo john rogers ubs and the executive defendants conspired to withhold this material information from plaintiff investors in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme the intent of the scheme was to induce plaintiffs to rely on the misrepresentations and omissions and to invest in pay by touch rogers had such a detailed history of criminal and civil misconduct and tax evasion prior to his involvement with pay by touch that any knowledge of this would have warned investors
7892872 defendant also conspired to misrepresent and withhold from plaintiffs the findings of a federal deposit insurance corporation report after investigating pay by touchs payment processing facility the fdic concluded that pay by touchs management had allowed serious problems to persist yet despite knowing about the fdics findings defendants participated in a scheme to hide the fdics investigation from investors and instead to suggest that no such investigation had occurred
7892873 based on defendants hype about pay by touch and its management

7892877 defendants do not provide such legal services in connection with the marks
7892878 additionally defendants cannot provide such services because defendants are not licensed attorneys capable of providing legal services
7892879 defendants have not exercised the requisite quality control over the legal services offered by any of its clients necessary to establish trademark rights therefore defendants do not have legitimate trademark rights in the marks
7892880 plaintiff jennifer siebel was swindled out of 75 000 by defendants jay rothstein and his company china venture films llc based on false promises that they were producing and financing an independent film in china in which plaintiff would act and produce based on those false promises plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendants in which she invested 75 000 when soliciting her investment defendants never had any intention of fulfilling the agreement including repaying plaintiff the 75 000 that she invested and that defendant rothstein pursuant to the contract agreed to be personally liable for
7892881 is essentially the same film as the film in which plaintiff invested plaintiff was not invited to appear in this film was not offered the chance to take part in the production of the film and has not been offered any rights to this film

7893151 there is an episcopalian church in san francisco called st gregory of nyssan where the two senior ministers have created a service that
7893152 no one has been out here to fix any potholes
7893153 in the past they have sent people out to bandage the road however that does nothing because the fillings come right out
7893154 i know you have helped other community members with such problems and we the residents of mayfield road will appreciate any help you can provide for us we need action and action 4 news is always there to help
7893155 we were looking to build the culture of this team
7893156 to us the culture refers to how the guys act when the coaching staff is not around
7893157 how hard do they work are they encouraging their teammates to be committed to our work ethic have the leaders taken responsibility for the team
7893158 this program has always attracted quality people who were committed to success thats a credit to our university and former coach now were looking to sharpen that focus and build a culture where the standards are passed from upperclassmen to the younger players we are going to have 18 new guys coming into our program over the next two years and its important we have that culture set in place
7893159 the one thing we looked at last year is that we had to come out of the gates flying
7893160 this team had been through a tough year in 2006 and for our confidence we needed to come out strong we were able to do that but we were spent emotionally and physically later in the year
7893161 we think we can help joey with the quality of depth we have added
7893162 we will find moments of rest for him when we can its also a maturity issue for joey too its important that he not emotionally expend so much early in a game or in the first 10 minutes of a game so that he understands the game is a marathon not a sprint i think he just felt like he had to do so much but now we have so many tools in place that this isnt necessary
7893163 he is one of our leaders and what he brings to our team is very special
7893164 for us to be successful we need him to be in the middle of dangerous situations in front of the other teams net its a very important part of our attack having mike and joey on the attack wherever we position them is crucial
7893165 at times late in the year teams just geared up to stop mike
7893166 with his experience and the help he will have up front we think that will be more difficult to do this season
7893167 but he still has so much to offer us he has a great soccer iq and we can use his presence on the field there are so many intangibles in danny that would help us well just have to see how his health holds up
7893168 the biggest thing with brent is that he has a winning edge
7893169 hes a very tough aggressive hardnosed kid hes a great passer of the ball and will be a blue collar playmaker for us i expect him to work hard to get into spots where he can make plays brent plays with a little edge that will help us
7893170 we needed farris in the back last year but we like the idea of using him in the midfield
7893171 he is very steady and tuned in to what we are trying to accomplish as a team the fact he is a fifth year player and has bought into what we are doing will really help we look at him as a vital part of our midfield
7893172 he has a sense of when to move in from the midfield to attack and knows how to become a dangerous player in the box his ability to recognize moments when he can be a threat will help us
7893173 jake has a ton of athleticism and speed that we can use in spurts
7893174 eduardo and uche will both be in the mix there for us
7893175 how they handle the transition to college will be a key eduardo is a very technical player who understands the game uche is a very crafty midfielder with good feet who brings a physical presence in there we could use both of them to help us balance our attack
7893176 matts versatility is one of the reasons we recruited him
7893177 we can plug him into a lot of different spots he is going to make an impact we just dont know where yet
7893178 steve is a developmental player who had a great summer playing for fc west chester
7893179 he may be an option for us at one of the outside midfield positions the energy he brings would be an asset for us
7893180 will and tony really add to our strength up front
7893181 we need to give seamon and joey options up front and both of these young guys have shown the ability to create and capitalize on scoring chances they can make us a more dangerous offensive team in the scoring area
7893182 the experience he gained as a freshman last year will be invaluable to him throughout the spring his leadership ability and his knack for being in the right place at the right time were really evident he will be our mainstay back there
7893183 miles played on the left last year but hes a natural right outside back
7893184 we think hell feel more comfortable in that role and he adds a lot of experience to our back line throughout the spring he really stepped up into a leadership role
7893185 he played there in the spring and did a good job one of the things he can do is hit a 40 yard long ball that is certainly a major asset to our back line being a senior makes him a valuable asset to us
7893186 nick did a tremendous job for us at the end of the year and had a great spring too
7893187 kevin is a big kid at 6 2 and his playmaking ability out of the back is good defensively he is tuned in to what we are doing back there and is just an honest hard working type kid who has embraced being at villanova
7893188 he really gets what were trying to do here his parents are alums and he really wants to be at villanova the coaching staff appreciates how helpful he is to us and committed he is to this program
7893189 adam has been with us for two years and understands our priorities
7893190 brian brings versatility and a sense for how to play
7893191 when you have someone go down in the final spring game as dave sauerhoff did for us it presents other guys with an opportunity
7893192 we brought in a couple of freshmen who now have a chance to make an immediate impact on the program were going to need them to contribute right away
7893193 chris has very good hands is very athletic and technically sound his technique is very clean and that will allow him to be successful he has to work on his presence in the box and thats true of any freshman you have to see how quickly they adjust to the speed of play at this level
7893194 john is a great shot stopper and tough kid hes got a very big upside and is athletic he has a presence out there which can help us has put in the work and is an option too
7893195 we expect better results with that being said we are in a very tough conference that is incredibly deep the thing we want to be able to say is that we left everything out there on the field and that our commitment level was total if we can do that consistently we will have made progress
7893196 the action alleges that dhs is an unsafe agency for children in violation of the federal constitutional and statutory rights of abused neglected and dependent children to receive services from a safe and appropriate agency and not a dangerous one

7893241 this is painful to watch my son waste away like this the hospital says the doctors are on strike demanding high salaries and there is nothing i can do for my son as i have no money to take him to a private doctor
7893242 so i just have to take him back home and buy painkillers as the nurses have advised i do not know what he is suffering from this time and we needed a doctor to diagnose what the problem is this time
7893243 all this is a reflection of the political system we have in the country everyone is on strike at any given time and things will not improve unless and until there is new leadership that will address the doctors concerns and those of other professionals in the country
7893244 as it is my son will die a painful death unless i find money to take him to a private doctor
7893245 we are just giving them painkillers as these are the only drugs available at the hospital since the strike started we have registered deaths which doctors could have dealt with if they were not on strike
7893246 it is cheaper to visit the traditional healers and under the circumstances there is no choice as private doctors are very expensive

7893332 la decisi n que ha tomado el club seguro que va a ser para dar un pasito m s de cara a que los canteranos est n bien amarrados
7893333 un club como este con un modelo nico se tiene que consolidar para seguir creciendo si queremos que no vuelva a pasar que equipos como el liverpool o el tottenham vengan a quitarnos futbolistas con mucho futuro en relaci n a mikel san jos y yuri berchiche el club tiene que retenerlos haci ndoles contratos para que no salgan y eso lo tiene que hacer un club saneado
7893334 en el mundo del f tbol al final las cosas son como son el club tiene que gestionar sus recursos econ micos tienen que tomar decisiones desde el sentido de qu es lo mejor y como hombre de club creo que esta decisi n va a suponer dar un pasito m s para que canteranos est n bien amarrados
7893335 el f tbol es de los futbolistas y si un jugador dice que no se va no se va

7893340 yeah well no but i mean a plate will probably be around 15 and if you include a drink were probably looking at 30 per head i can feed myself and the cat for a week with that sort of money
7893341 yeah me too and some meat okay let me see how much they charge for steak amp eggs at ici 14 huh
7893342 ill pay the extra 2 also theres probably a reason why they charge a bit more you know good restaurants charge more because they use fresh and better ingredients

7893544 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had

7893569 a quick politico survey of stylists and hair transplant surgeons some of whom have followed bidens career path for years while others didnt know about him until yesterday found that there was little mystery
7893570 joe biden does bring one big constituency with him the hair club for men this man is a role model to millions of american men he beat a disease male pattern baldness
7893571 i like joe biden despite snide asides that hes been preparing a 500 000 word acceptance speech since iowa and the hair plug jokes
7893572 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs
7893573 sam donaldson and his hair walk by presumably to interview joe biden and his hair
7893574 with tragedy sprinkled throughout his life hes earned every white hair fill in your own hair plug joke
7893575 in fact everything about biden from his hair plugs and capped teeth to his working class irish catholic upbringing to his extremely long tenure in the nations most exclusive club screams vain old white guy
7893576 biden has taken ribbing over the years for his changing hairline theres been talk about hair plugs since his first run for president in 1987
7893577 p lus the widespread rumor that his hair is not his own
7893578 its going to be wall to wall hair plugs today a continuous stream of joe biden
7893579 joe biden senator barack obamas vice presidential running mate is a career politician who has taken big contributions from lobbyists been mocked for his hair transplants and admitted plagiarising speeches and exaggerating his academic record
7893580 but the juxtaposition between rich romney and biden who bears a common touch from his hair plugs to his loafers probably wouldnt help mccain much
7893581 hes tan rested and thanks to exquisite teeth and some excellent hair plugs camera ready
7893582 and that leads to the easy warning that ive been telling friends for years never trust a man who gets hairplugs
7893583 bidens hair look it doesnt really matter okay but it was distracting joe needs to tell his barber to take a little more off the back and sides
7893584 i have to say his inability to shut up drives me up the wall but theres also an appealing lack of guile to the man he wears his flaws like his hair plugs out and proud
7893585 and the dubious distinction of becoming the first national party nominee with known hair plugs
7893586 the problem is that whereas obama is a young lightweight biden is an old lightweight obama with a hair transplant
7893587 there is no doubt he had hair transplants the guy is wearing barbies hair
7893588 i s there anyone that thinks that biden brings much of anything to this ticket aside from hair plugs and an over inflated sense of self worth that is
7893589 the selection of joe biden the oldest functioning white liberal senator with a foreign policy background who is catholic with hair plugs in the democratic party
7893590 joe biden now has an unfair advantage in the game of politics with hair that is not where god intended it to be its just so unfair to dick cheney
7893591 m aybe its because john mccains comb over tells you everything you need to know about the man and its not pretty
7893592 american troops would join the polish military at least temporarily at the front lines facing east toward russia
7893593 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
7893594 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
7893595 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
7893596 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
7893597 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack by giving the usa permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
7893598 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
7893599 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
7893600 it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier us technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions
7893601 particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
7893602 the days of satellites and spheres of influence are behind us
7893603 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
7893604 the fighting which broke out over the weekend between russia and georgia has brought israels intensive involvement in the region into the limelight this involvement includes the sale of advanced weapons to georgia and the training of the georgian armys infantry forces

7893606 oh man the flag might be behind the wagon or it may be behind that well or there might be flags in both places ill have to walk over there and check
7893607 this is the most ridiculous waste of time ive ever seen
7893608 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7893609 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7893610 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7893611 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7893612 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7893613 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide
7893614 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
7893615 improved methods to detect molecules have been demonstrated and more people need to be using these methods to detect molecules given off from cancer we have developed laser based methods to detect molecules mid infrared lasers can measure suspected cancer biomarkers ethane formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
7893616 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area
7893617 the science supports it and the dogs tell us there is something there
7893618 this lidar will serve as a reference for future or existing systems especially since this kind of remote sensing is experiencing rapid development
7893619 the hopes in barack that he has and the hopes for the country are exactly the hopes that hes always carried in his heart
7893620 ted has been fighting for the things that barack obama has made priorities of the campaign
7893621 barack obama represents the kind of change president kennedy represented in his time
7893622 if at some point we get an individual assistance add on to this particular major disaster declaration we will then send out inspectors to everyone that calls into fema said fema coordinating officer tom davies

7893630 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7893631 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7893632 ceos tell people all the time that they value integrity a good way to walk the walk is have integrity on salaries
7893633 a major concern from a management perspective is that an employee goes from being unhappy to becoming a true villain
7893634 in a worst case scenario an employee may actually try and sabotage others by spreading rumors not sharing important work related information and engage in other problem behaviors
7893635 payscale takes it to the next level its very scientific
7893636 by working together to offer an inside look at companies we can open access and bring greater transparency to information in one of the most important parts of our lives our work
7893637 the best way for employees to handle a perceived inequity in salary is to gather market data on what similar positions make in other organizations and make a thoughtful and rational performance based argument on why they should be closer to or even exceed the salary of their peers
7893638 being a scot has made all the difference in my life
7893639 but as we were preparing the script we realised that it would be unworkable so we decided to make a book instead
7893640 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
7893641 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving its far too early to know how all these effects together will influence insurance claim costs

7893647 gl ckwunsch erstmal zur leistung der mannschaft dennoch hat es nicht zum ganz gro en sieg gereicht
7893648 ja gut hh da lief sicher noch nicht alles ganz optimal aber im gro en und ganzen sind wir mit unserer indoor soccer erfahrung bei catz sports in stapelfeld doch recht zufrieden
7893649 da wird jetzt wieder viel hochsterilisiert sicher ist es komisch auf blauem rasen zu spielen aber wir waren super vorbereitet wir haben eigentlich die ganze woche vorher blau gemacht
7893650 nein ich denke nicht aber da muss man schon mal fahrbereitschaft zeigen und auch mal lange wege gehen um hier in stapelfeld antreten zu k nnen
7893651 sicher kein europ isches top niveau weder in der players lounge noch bei den facilities aber f r den kreis storman durchaus angemessen
7893652 wirklich nur eine untergeordnete rolle 35 bis 50 f r pro court und stunde hallenfu ball sind okay

7893655 it was her claim and there came a point when he realised that he was helping in a fraudulent claim but by then he was in too deep
7893656 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
7893657 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
7893658 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
7893659 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
7893660 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
7893661 furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections
7893662 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
7893663 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
7893664 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
7893665 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
7893666 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
7893667 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
7893668 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air
7893669 the research found this noninvasive method of cardiac imaging will effectively detect stenosis a constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries which can lead to heart attacks and may require surgery to repair
7893670 this is good news for patients who in the past might have been forced to undergo a more expensive and invasive procedure to determine if they suffered from blockages in the arteries leading to their hearts
7893671 diagnostic performance of 64 multidetector row coronary computed tomographic angiography for evaluation of coronary artery stenosis in individuals without known coronary artery disease
7893672 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7893673 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7893674 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7893675 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7893676 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7893677 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7893678 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
7893679 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
7893680 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
7893681 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake

7893687 glad he got his job back for this incident try to give a kid a break using his discretion and this is what he gets
7893688 seems pretty logical to me considering all the bs he would have to do just to take a kid to jail for possession of one baggie
7893689 when it comes to drugs youth and innocence have little relation to one another hope the cop learned a lesson from this

7893695 theres nothing to see what is she not supposed to talk to guys theres nothing i can do but let guys be guys let girls be girls let jojo put his album out and let them live their life thats all i can do is raise them the best that i can and watch them operate in this world without cramping their style ive been blessed with kids that are smart and theyre not followers theyre leaders theyre not really caught up in the whole game like that they move around theyre basically good kids it doesnt guarantee anything but i did the best i could and i do the best i can
7893696 that siege the coast blockade and the overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population
7893697 that has been ignored despite overwhelming evidence of deteriorating mental and physical health that has reached crisis proportions
7893698 above all what is being tested is whether the imaginative engagement of dedicated private citizens can influence the struggle of a beleaguered people for basic human rights and whether their courage and commitment can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy

7893701 this has been in the making for a while said piercy who is a scorching 42 under par over the course of his last 216 holes and with other 08 two timers
7893702 i discovered what makes me tick on the golf course he said
7893703 i would have gotten mad with that front nine result in the past he said
7893704 but i really think ive matured as a person and a player
7893705 theyll have a hard time beating me when i do that consistently i think ive proved that the last few weeks
7893706 im really tired but so excited said piercy whose main claim to fame prior to the last three weeks was his victory in the ultimate game a made for television event that came with the biggest first place check 2 million ever awarded
7893707 ill be doing a lot of relaxing next week and it will be great to see the kids

7893728 because your childs symptoms will vary according to setting and interaction with specific individuals you have likely noticed this yourself around certain people or in specific settings your child may act like an angel and in other settings the telltale behavioral symptoms emerge with intensity this means that your childs differences are responsive to individuals and environments in short your child is reacting and resonding to what is going on

7893730 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7893731 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7893732 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

7893765 theyre saying were not going to buy these loans when their exposure is very narrow
7893766 we think that the law that was passed is beneficial not only to the borrower the one who holds the mortgage but also to the lender so in this case it would be fannie or freddie
7893767 we dont blame them based on the way the law was written its going to have a negative impact i dont think itll be a huge one until the market improves

7893841 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
7893842 we couldnt find a good credit card processing company that didnt want to charge us 15 percent
7893843 we didnt want to use any of the third party billers such as dmr or ibill who were the biggest at that time so we got our own merchant account with that we ran our adult sites successfully for a while then the company gateway that we used for our credit card processing decided they wanted to get out of the adult business we wound up buying the rights to their software and we took over all of their adult merchants which numbered about 100 at the time after we did that for about a year we decided to develop our own software it was a particular need of the webmasters because the adult internet was really starting to grow
7893844 we didnt have a ton of money at the time to get it rolling we had to borrow some money from family but we started well with the 100 clients we inherited and soon after that many of those clients started to take off in terms of the volume they were doing video streaming and live feeds were just starting to come around and that really helped the adult internet to grow
7893845 weve always stuck to our guns in terms of never doing third party processing
7893846 all of our merchants always have had their own merchant accounts
7893847 but i think our biggest advantage lies in the personalities of our employees we have several employees who have been with us for years and theyre on a first name basis with so many of our clients because of that we really provide a lot of one on one service that you wont get with other companies whether a merchant is moving to us from a third party company or whether theyre starting from scratch we have our hands in their entire business as far as processing goes from getting their merchant account to deciding which banks are best for them well help them establish a corporation well help them set up their payment forms well help them get their affiliate programs running from end to end we have so much contact with our merchants because we know their success depends on how well we take care of them this is one of the reasons why we dont have an automated demo of our administration area we want to be one on one with every client having 60 employees can be tough to manage so it is important to have the right ones and we are very fortunate to have such a dedicated crew of professionals as part of our team
7893848 weve had to deal with visa and mastercard cracking down on chargeback ratios they began with a 5 percent chargeback ratio and then they reduced it to a 2 5 percent ratio we had to diversify and expand our fraud scrubbing and help our merchants change the way they do business in order to comply with the new ratio and keep their customers happy we have a good success rate in helping merchants to keep their chargebacks low and facilitating their cross sells and cross promotions
7893849 the high points are the relationships weve built over the years
7893850 we go to dozens of shows every year and weve built some incredible friendships of course the increase of business is a high point too but having the relationships within the industry has been the best reward
7893851 one of the nice things that has changed over the years
7893852 is that running under someone elses merchant account via third party processing used to be a good umbrella under which the merchant could hide a guy with high chargebacks and offset him with a guy who has really low chargebacks
7893853 our clients are comfortable with netbilling because they know were not taking the risks on other merchant chargebacks outside of losing that merchants income this gives our clients confidence in us because over the years so many third party processors have gone out of business and often theyve walked away with the merchants money
7893854 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
7893855 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
7893856 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
7893857 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
7893858 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
7893859 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
7893860 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
7893861 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
7893862 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
7893863 it is very easy to construct buildings but it is very difficult to build a fortress culture like this
7893864 all of us driven by the simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7893865 he knows that the thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as a nation even when we disagree
7893866 yes there are some job losses yes there are some companies that are restructuring because its a tougher national and international environment
7893867 the fundamentals in our state are very good theyre the best anywhere in australia
7893868 they management deny it will have an impact on the masthead but theyre not justifying how
7893869 there seems to be a remarkable focus on editorial staff and you have to wonder whether some of the highly paid executives are entirely necessary if they can save money they will
7893870 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7893871 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites
7893872 the problem tim holding has here is he made the announcement without any consultation and clearly this has outraged a lot of people locally
7893873 tim holding has put all his eggs in the basket of a problem of an investment basis
7893874 there are a variety of details as yet unexplained about that investment and it would be useful if tim holding put all that information on the table too
7893875 the reason they call him hitler and zimbabwean dictator mugabe is because theyve likened it to what happened in those countries
7893876 there were many other actions he could have taken to discipline the board if he felt theyd done the wrong thing
7893877 the former board have let down the community of mildura by their poor decisions including an unlawful investment which forced the government to act
7893878 both are running at a loss so taxpayers there are actually paying for the service
7893879 the success of skybus shows that buses can deliver a high quality service to help meet melbournes public transport needs
7893880 brett carroll was a hard working decent australian he lost his life in a workplace accident that should never have happened
7893881 on behalf of the community i denounce paper australias offending
7893882 given its history i consider paper australia has only reasonable prospects of rehabilitation
7893883 brett was ecstatic about having a daughter and called her his finest achievement and me a perfect mother
7893884 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
7893885 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
7893886 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
7893887 looksmart has a strong online marketing brand and a long operating history while we did not want to change our trade name our new corporate identity reflects our commitment to quality search advertising products and services through the companys proven adcenter platform and tenacious delivery of results for search advertisers and web publishers on our search advertising networks
7893888 looksmarts business transition from a consumer web directory and search engine to a trusted independent search advertising network and technology solutions provider was not yet fully addressed looksmart has gone through a compelling evolution and needed a look that captures its leadership position today
7893889 it is great to see looksmarts brand identity reflect the great work the companys employees have been doing in growing our business in search advertising networks we have emerged as an essential complement to web publishers and search advertisers who seek to go beyond the major search engines to monetize their traffic and extend their advertising reach cost effectively
7893890 tonight we come to the end of sixteen glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7893891 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked
7893892 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7893913 i believe in the right to protest but i acted against my own principles
7893914 i actually didnt prepare for this operation anyway because i was just assuming it was going to be cancelled
7893915 it is so disappointing because life would be so much easier if this was done and we could live a normal life even go away from home and not worry about having to be close to hospital
7893916 that may include a further advertising campaign to try to attract nurses who have the qualifications back into the system
7893917 we may need to look at what we can do overseas
7893918 we may need also to provide more scholarships but that wont provide a short term response
7893919 no child should have to endure such cancellations no family should have to go through anything like this
7893920 for too long theres been a stalemate between the states and the federal government and thats hurt our health system
7893921 thats why the first thing we need to do is end the blame game and were doing exactly that
7893922 the theatre has been sitting idle for several hours after surgery was again cancelled today
7893923 the australian funding was provided to the hellenic red cross special emergency fund for victims of fire for the general purpose of helping with the relief effort
7893924 immediately after the fires the municipality asked us to use this money for construction of a town hall because it was the request of all the local representatives
7893925 i remember when i went to zaharo i was received warmly and made an honorary citizen
7893926 i was asked to do this and it is something i agreed to do
7893927 when we found out from the australian government something was not ok with the permits it was too late and the project had started
7893928 however i requested on 20 june 2008 from the municipality of zaharo that all work should be stopped on this project until the situation was cleared up
7893929 i declare categorically that the intent of the greek red cross was and is relief for the fire victims and if someone has acted illegally in this particular instance we reserve every legal right

7893941 oh she has a birthday perhaps we should send her something like a card or a present
7893942 is it for me is it for me for my birthday
7893943 obviously theres a difference between attracting and retaining it professionals
7893944 it is relatively clear that the pipeline of available adequately skilled people is not as strong as the demand for resources thats the nutshell
7893945 is executives remain concerned that theyre not getting the folks with proper skills to join their organization
7893946 it drives me nuts when people talk about it aligned with business and not with each other
7893947 business executives have laptops pdas and they can use them so they think they know everything about it
7893948 but it is more complicated than that it really should be the aim of cios to help educate business executive to understand and leverage it theres a frustration among it managers in assuring that it is being leverage in the business
7893949 we see which pieces of the puzzle is executives see as more important in their minds
7893950 i have to balance your lack of previous convictions with the effect on the remainder of these two persons lives and how they were affected by your conduct
7893951 i have come to the view that there is no option other than to send you to prison the period will be 21 months
7893952 right now publishers are on a crash course with e textbooks
7893953 they are expensive and impractical for a large portion of the student population
7893954 my overarching question is how does the availability of this new choice hurt students
7893955 the cost is totally dependent on which book theyre talking about the cost of printer cartridges and other things
7893956 a student who wants to print out a whole book should buy a whole book
7893957 once a student buys a textbook it should be theirs to keep and access wherever and whenever they want
7893958 anything less than complete access would make digital books impractical for large numbers of students with limited access to computers and or the internet
7893959 i know the work that goes into creating a textbook from the authorship to the infographics
7893960 i have done more in the last two months than people in my positions historically have done and i am going to keep doing it and we are committed to winning the white house and making barack president

7893965 nothing says change like someone whos been a senator since the nixon administration libraryben npr interview with ed rendell rendell likes biden pick
7893966 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7893967 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7893968 it makes bhps bid look better it was looking fine before but it looks even better now
7893969 its going to be hard for rio to make a concerted push from here to argue that they are undervalued

7894476 if the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia want to live independently then the leadership of the russian federation ought to respond and support their independence because a people has the right to define how and where its members want to live

7894478 it is not clear why the president of chechnya a republic

7894543 time warner today publicly offered to air badger football games on a pay per view basis
7894544 while proposals have recently been exchanged there is a wide gap between what time warner and its other competitors would seem to agree is reasonable and fair
7894545 time warner has already had more than 18 months to decide to offer the big ten network to its customers and in a statement wednesday said we are ready to carry the network fine then they should carry the network and at terms comparable to the networks other agreements or they should tell their customers they have decided not to either way badger fans deserve to know the truth
7894546 time warner cable and all parties worked through the weekend to complete this agreement in principle our company worked diligently to ensure a deal that was in the best interest of our customers

7894566 he was very conscious of being a role model not only for cricket for sport particularly through the depression he was a hero to everybody he was always extraordinarily aware of his responsibility and always endeavoured to do the right thing
7894567 he never grasped the interest in him and he found it very difficult to understand that he was remembered for so long after he finished playing cricket
7894568 he didnt like celebrations and he didnt like fuss and i think if he had known what was going to happen on his centenary he would have been quite grateful he got out in the 90s
7894569 he didnt want to be remembered for his cricketing achievements he wanted to be remembered for his integrity
7894570 he lived a life where he had a job from which he earned his income and he played cricket which he loved but there was really no connection between them

7894586 this is supposed to be the point in your life when everything comes together not when everything falls apart

7894598 our lord was pleased that i should have at times a vision of this kind i saw an angel close by me on my left side in bodily form this i am not accustomed to see unless very rarely though i have visions of angels frequently yet i see them only by an intellectual vision such as i have spoken of before it was our lords will that in this vision i should see the angel in this wise he was not large but small of stature and most beautiful his face burning as if he were one of the highest angels who seem to be all of fire they must be those whom we call cherubim their names they never tell me but i see very well that there is in heaven so great a difference between one angel and another and between these and the others that i cannot explain it i saw in his hand a long spear of gold and at the irons point there seemed to be a little fire he appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart and to pierce my very entrails when he drew it out he seemed to draw them out also and to leave me all on fire with a great love of god the pain was so great that it made me moan and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain that i could not wish to be rid of it the soul is satisfied now with nothing less than god the pain is not bodily but spiritual though the body has its share in it even a large one it is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and god that i pray god of his goodness to make him experience it who may think that i am lying during the days that this lasted i went about as if beside myself i wished to see or speak with no one but only to cherish my pain which was to me a greater bliss than all created things could give me i was in this state from time to time whenever it was our lords pleasure to throw me into those deep trances which i could not prevent even when i was in the company of others and which to my deep vexation came to be publicly known since then i do not feel that pain so much but only that which i spoke of before i do not remember the chapter which is in many ways very different from it and of greater worth on the other hand when this pain of which i am now speaking begins our lord seems to lay hold of the soul and to throw it into a trance so that there is no time for me to have any sense of pain or suffering because fruition ensues at once may he be blessed for ever who hath bestowed such great graces on one who has responded so ill to blessings so great

7894640 hard and fair is fine with me cloughie and alex ferguson were very hard with me but i have to say when i look back now generally they were fair with me as well and thats what i try to do with my own players
7894641 dont get me wrong we are all different it depends what time of day you might catch somebody you might catch somebody on a bad day
7894642 but i look back at brian clough particularly when he questioned a lot of my stuff i had one or two incidents with him and i look back now to when he sent me back from jersey for a drinking incident and he was spot on
7894643 he was just being fair with me i was no angel
7894644 i dont know i was young i was raw in my time at forest im not sure im not sure what he would have said to be honest
7894645 he would probably have thought i would be the last person to become a manager because my own off the field life wasnt exactly perfect
7894646 i have to say he was an absolute genius i meet other players who played under him and we have all got our own stories
7894647 but he was a genius an absolute genius and certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of a doubt
7894648 i just feel very lucky like other players who played under him to have had that opportunity

7894653 hay muchas situaciones en que esta informaci n podr a ser utilizada de modo muy provechoso
7894654 en un extremo podr a ser utilizada para informar las estrategias de planificaci n de emergencias y en el otro podr a resultar til para organizar el flujo de viandantes en reas congestionadas
7894655 todos nos hemos encontrado en situaciones en las que hemos sido arrastrados por la multitud
7894656 pero lo que resulta interesante acerca de esta investigaci n es que nuestros participantes terminaron llegando a una decisi n de consenso pese al hecho de que no se les permit a hablar o gesticular entre ellos en la mayor parte de los casos los participantes no fueron conscientes de haber sido dirigidos por otros
7894657 inicialmente comenzamos teniendo en cuenta la toma de decisiones por consenso por parte de los humanos porque est bamos interesados en la migraci n animal en particular la de los p jaros en la que puede resultar dif cil identificar a los l deres de la bandada
7894658 pero esto no hace m s que mostrar que existen fuertes paralelismos entre el comportamiento grupal de los animales y el de las multitudes humanas
7894659 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7894681 we are fortunate here in scotland to have airwaves to spare and it is vital the uk regulator responds to public demands for local tv in scotland to be made available for all
7894682 digital switchover offers a once in a life time opportunity for scotland to have local television coverage we expect ofcom to ensure the allocation of these airwaves in the most efficient way and for local television to deliver local public purpose by involving local people in broadcasting in ways that bigger media has proved unable to do
7894683 the fife and tayside local tv working group is one of many representing all areas of scotland and calls upon ofcom to allocate scotlands spectrum to allow for a seventh multiplex of channels this seventh mux would be able to carry five additional channels suitable for local tv as well as support a new scottish channel if this were required
7894684 there are serious concerns the regulator has made commitment ahead of the consultation closing decisions that would remove from scotland five separate digital tv channels channels that offer tremendous capacity for a variety of new services that can be made more relevant to scottish audiences and local areas than many of the channels emanating from london

7894695 the data here clearly show as they did in a national study we conducted earlier this year that a site based on information from a local mls will give consumers a more accurate picture of whats available in a local market in comparison to idx powered web sites like roost or the mls listings in dallas miami or san diego sites like google yahoo trulia and zillow are still struggling to collect a comparable comprehensive data set of accurate listings

7894712 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7894713 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7894714 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7894715 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7894716 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7894717 some destinations will have great airfares some will have reasonable airfares and some youll just want to avoid
7894718 its easy in the short run to say wow this situation is never going to change but it always does

7894720 and i said to myself something is going on here
7894721 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7894722 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7894723 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7894724 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7894725 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise

7894751 if helmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7894752 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7894753 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together
7894754 afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and the latest food crisis has made farmers even more vulnerable opium is a seasonal plant it may be gone today but back again tomorrow
7894755 this must be done now while farmers are deciding whether or not to plant opium for the 2008 09 harvest timely and targeted international assistance is vital
7894756 corrupt officials landowners warlords and criminals must feel the full force of the law otherwise the opium economy will continue to operate with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it

7894801 for its part the bush administration has essentially dropped its democratization campaign in the region
7894802 israel it was revealed today has allowed egypt to transfer an enormous quantity of weapons to fatah
7894803 and so in a move of astonishing obtuseness israel has once again overseen the arming of its foes incredibly according to media reports the shipment of weapons was actually escorted across the egypt gaza border by israeli military police
7894804 whining about human rights and all the rest of this crap

7894824 we have a legitimate right to direct our guns against israeli occupation
7894825 weve made a lot of progress over recent years in particular because of the hard work of president abbas

7894851 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7894852 the budget we have for academies nationally is targeted as our most immediate priority which is the transformation of under performing secondary schools
7894853 what is being masqueraded as financial capability is confined to a couple of hours of recognising notes and coins and simple calculations using money
7894854 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7894855 hes consistently made plays in practice as well as both scrimmages
7894856 in this last week he certainly solidified his position as a starter
7894857 theyve had a good three weeks of practice certainly well have a lot to learn as far as understanding the speed of the game and how fast its going to go
7894858 theres a tremendous amount of pride in that conference right now
7894859 i know because i was in that conference and i had a lot of pride i know what we felt like when we went on the road and played in the sec we took a tremendous amount of pride in making sure that when we left the field they knew that theyd been in a game and hopefully you had a chance to win in the fourth quarter ulm has gone one step further theyve won one in the fourth quarter on the road the warhawks are coming in here and they believe that theyre going to win
7894860 i expect him to get some time in there i dont think our timing would be 100 percent but it can pick up pretty quickly because weve been throwing it and catching it a lot the past couple of years later down the line it will get better he looks pretty good but he doesnt want to push it too hard in practice it doesnt matter what were doing hes not getting any contact
7894861 caleb looked pretty good today i wouldnt have known that he had any problem before today
7894862 recruiting is going well finally after two back to back bowl wins and if we can make it three years in a row to the post season then i think national prominence is possible we need to build continuity in the program and recruit well but we also have to win games now its just a matter of whether were going to move forward and if the new faces will make their own names or whether theyll slide and not be as productive as i anticipate we can be
7894863 because for a while i was like man i am too short then you realize im not going to grow anymore nothing really i can do about the height you learn to work with it and do the best that you can with it and when people say it you try to just laugh at it and keep on going
7894864 we have a plan for this game for anybodys who on that depth chart
7894865 taylors had a little bit better preseason practice he had a good summer going to workouts and mike did too
7894866 mike will be in early though hes ready to play
7894867 hes just a big physical presence in the middle there
7894868 when he tackles you they go down he could definitely impact our football team and im hopeful that it all works out

7894905 whenever theres a sense of a lessening of our economic welfare whether real or perceived the consumer starts to become a little more frugal and promotions do seem to have a slightly greater effect
7894906 the people who already use coupons probably look a little bit more diligently but our trend research shows that its additional people using coupons more frequently as well
7894907 the demographic thats more impacted by a recession are the ones that are thinking about using coupons even more
7894908 its the mid to lower incomes the demographics that i think are first impacted by a recession in terms of the average working person and working family
7894909 i think there might be a bit of a perception of i have to use coupons now because were making less money or it costs me more to fill my tank each week
7894910 once you develop a habit its no longer an inconvenience
7894911 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7894912 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7894913 the campaigns aggressive tactics could draw more attention to a subject the campaign wants to go away on tuesday the university of illinois at chicago will make available records of obamas service on the board of the chicago annenberg challenge the group was set up to improve the citys schools the documents could shed further light on whether obama and ayers had a relationship
7894914 theyve in some sense lost a year of their life theyre going to graduate college at 23 and 22 there doesnt seem to be much benefit
7894915 the problem is now people are maybe pushing it a little far and you can imagine people continuing to push it until you have eight year old kindergartners and it sort of doesnt matter how smart he actually is
7894916 if youre basically holding a kid out of school early on if the cost of that is you have to work more later that really resonates with people
7894917 the youngest kids are getting diagnosed with adhd theyre getting medicated and that i think is really scary to a lot of people
7894918 i think theres this notion that disorders like that are somewhat more subjective than other things
7894919 if youre at an age where you havent matured yet and being compared then obviously theres going to be an appearance of adhd which might go away in six months
7894920 i cant see people holding their child back though without a reason i know when we moved to new brunswick from prince edward island people were astounded we would hold him back a year
7894921 it came to a point where he was saying hi my name is parker im 5 and i dont go to school

7894943 in some way complicate the already complex terrain that people in their 20s and 30s must navigate
7894944 this is supposed to be the point in your life when everything comes together not when everything falls apart
7894945 if you really love someone that much how could you ask that person to go through all of this
7894946 thinking of your life stresses me out i cant do this
7894947 no matter what we do or how good we are at being patients
7894948 who wants to be labeled as the sick one especially when the leap from sick to not as productive or unreliable isnt too difficult to make for people who dont understand the nature of chronic illness
7894949 i would love if this book got people talking on a larger scale

7895014 i promise you i will be on that senate floor on january 5
7895015 it is a fact that millions of americans voted for mrs clinton this year
7895016 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7895017 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7895018 each of us comes here also by way of our own improbable journey
7895019 after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7895020 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7895021 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7895022 now you know why i asked her out so many times you want a persistent president
7895023 people just need to understand whats going to animate him why he is going to run through that wall for the middle class in this country because he has a keen understanding of what theyre going through
7895024 i think he has to overcome that he has to persuade the american public he can be thoughtful and can still be one of them and he can do that because his roots are legitimate as are michelles
7895025 has got to talk more working stiff and less harvard
7895026 i still think barack obama can win comfortably especially if he makes the connection that should have been easier than it was but is still eluding him which is the working stiffs
7895027 father from kenya mother from kansas and a funny name
7895028 needs to explain that his story while seemingly different is really in fact very common his father was an immigrant his mother was a single mom he was raised by grandparents he pulled himself up by his bootstraps he has a wife he has two children hes the american success story

7895030 a legitimate business never asks for passwords or personal information over the internet
7895031 you have to be very aware of what youre doing on the computer
7895032 these are rampant throughout the industry we get spurts of them now and again
7895033 you have to be careful when opening these things you never know when they can contain a virus
7895034 we encourage people not to open these or respond by e mail or by calling the numbers
7895035 we believe that mr zardari is the right candidate for this office because he truly represented the unity of federations
7895036 an independent judiciary forms the backbone of the democratic system in the country and god willing if i win this will be my first priority
7895037 stance is that the candidate should be a symbol of federation not disintegration
7895038 i have challenged mr zardari to come forward and present his vision before the nation
7895039 the worst part in this complete mess unleashed by the break up of coalition is that the hydra of militancy and terrorism may well be relegated further down the governments list of priorities since it will be fighting not for the survival of its citizens but for its own

7895178 se termin el acopio con un volumen superior a los 35 millones de kilos estamos haciendo un trabajo muy intenso en el poder legislativo nacional este es un acuerdo que hemos hecho con aptm gobiernos provinciales de las provincias tabacaleras la secretaria de agricultura y las empresas para incrementar la al cuota que data del a o 1989 que fue la ltima vez que tuvo actualizaci n
7895179 la posici n de ahora es incrementarla significativamente y a partir de eso generar un mecanismo de actualizaci n porcentual en funci n del valor del paquete de cigarrillo y adem s de eso una imposici n m nima del tabaco equivalente al 75 por ciento del valor de las marcas mas vendidas esto significa que va a generar un incremento significativo y va a pasar a componer en parte impuestos o tributos a las arcas del estado nacional otra parte va a ser destinado al fondo especial del tabaco donde el 80 es destinado a precios para productores para reconversi n de reas tabacaleras
7895180 no puede haber acuerdos en las condiciones que hoy estamos y si surge es porque otra vez van a existir muchas razones de por medio y van a claudicar los principios muchos de los representantes de los sectores que van a tomar decisiones personalistas y arbitrarias

7895183 nosotros tenemos un costo hecho por las nueve entidades del sector de la producci n las cuales claudicaron todos los principios el costo del a o pasado que votaron las nueve entidades era de 0 86 centavos eso era el costo que ten an que llevar luego de eso nuestros representantes votaron 0 52 centavos tomando una decisi n arbitraria y totalmente personalista que hoy est n en vigencia pero que no se cumplen
7895184 podemos llegar a un acuerdo discutir y conversar pero creo que hoy por hoy la discusi n pasar a la secretar a de agricultura y de esa forma le dar amos m s trabajo a cheppi carlos cheppi secretario de agricultura de la naci n ya que tan bien se lleva con guillermo moreno secretario de comercio interior y que ellos nos definan a nosotros como debemos cobrar vestir comer y vivir
7895185 hace unos meses atr s dec amos que nos est bamos acercando al sector nacional y a las entidades nacionales as fue y hoy seguimos acerc ndonos y creo que fue una apertura interesante para los productores de la provincia de misiones ya que ac las voces se escuchan muy poco aunque all en buenos aires tambi n nos dan poco lugar creo que esto del campo hizo que los marcos de discusi n sean de nivel m s elevados para la provincia

7895187 if the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia want to live independently then the leadership of the russian federation ought to respond and support their independence because a people has the right to define how and where its members want to live

7895200 quanto sia forte la curiosit e la voglia di conoscere la vita di andreas hofer da parte soprattutto dei cittadini del quartiere di cittadella a mantova luogo in cui fu fucilato leroe tirolese il 20 febbraio del 1810 lintenzione della compagnia mantovana condivisa dallamministrazione locale quella di organizzare iniziative rivolte sia ai residenti che alle scuole

7895202 ancora una volta ci troviamo di fronte a un attacco contro le comunit cristiane lennesimo episodio di una persecuzione che sembra non avere fine la libert religiosa costituisce la cartina tornasole per il rispetto di tutte le altre libert e diritti delluomo
7895203 la persecuzione dei cristiani nel mondo rappresenta infatti una delle pi feroci sfide contemporanee alla dignit della persona ha aggiunto mauro alla promozione dei nostri ideali di libert e di giustizia deve diventare sempre pi il marchio dellunione europea contro chi si rifugia nellideologia per il suo progetto di potere

7895208 i think that is far too simplistic an interpretation of my appointment
7895209 i dont think it was necessarily my experience as a dealmaker but rather my 17 years in the financial services sector and my knowledge of the sector that management thought would be useful in the cfo role
7895210 if a split were to occur and such support for the investment bank no longer existed we believe a substantial capital injection would be required into the investment bank
7895211 at the end of the day it is an investment bank and more or less anyone who gets promoted into a top job is going to have some sort of dealmaking background because thats what they do

7895213 the immediate task is to get the firm back on the road to profitability and success my job now is to use my experience working with financial services companies to assist in ensuring that our three autonomous business divisions run profitably and that our funding framework is appropriate for each division

7895231 in one years time our communication with each other will fluctuate we will be struggling with our own problems separately sometimes too ashamed to admit to each other all of the mistakes weve made i know it seems like we can make it through all of this now but we are really going to question that in a year do you believe me
7895232 in one years time surprisingly we will be almost exactly where we are now at least in some ways our chemistry together is unfailing we will still be able to look at each other right in the eyes and induce laughter that other people look suspiciously at but while were looking each other in the eyes in about a year we will both know that there is a pain in there that neither of us have the ability to heal for each other do you believe me
7895233 in one years time you will be pregnant i will be so excited for you i will be so proud of the life you have put together for yourself i will feel so silly knowing that its a life i will never have in a year from now you will have had countless conversations with me where you could barely understand what i was saying where you constantly asked me what are you on right now where i ran from your questions where i ran from you because we will have become very different people do you believe me
7895234 in one years time you will still be one of my most faithful friends you will have worried for me probably more than you let me know i will crawl to you with the admittance that i fucked up again you will ask me if im going to stop this time in a year you will still encourage me to write just like you used to in high school you will still be the person i go to when i need to laugh the most and you usually wont know it do you believe me
7895235 in one years time i will be avoiding your calls mr debt collector i will be skipping your appointments doctor i will be scaring the shit out of you mom dad and brothers i will become even more estranged from you sister in a year i will surprise you all so much do you believe me

7895288 nothing is more urgent or of greater significance to the american people than solving our energy crisis the good news is this bipartisan group truly understands that folks across this country are suffering under high gas prices and are bringing forth real common sense solutions

7895290 we felt confident when we formed this bipartisan group that wed quickly receive support from our colleagues
7895291 i am so pleased to have senator coleman as a member of our bipartisan effort he indeed understands that congress needs to take action immediately so that people in minnesota and all across this country will have the relief they deserve from high energy costs we look forward to his leadership and input as we move forward with senator coleman as a member of our group the people of minnesota can be certain they have a seat at the table as we move forward in addressing the current energy crisis

7895329 la roma riuscita a ribaltare una situazione difficile nel finale di gara e poi ha avuto la possibilit di chiudere i conti nel supplementare usciamo a testa alta anche considerando i calci di rigore li abbiamo battuti tutti bene nessuno andato fuori
7895330 nel primo tempo linter ci ha tolto spazio e forse noi abbiamo sbagliato qualcosa ho visto una buona inter anche a livello fisico una squadra molto attenta in fase difensiva molto compatta se siamo arrivati davanti alla loro porta anche nei supplementari vuol dire che abbiamo fatto qualcosa di buono comunque non ho visto differenze tra le due squadre inter e roma volevano vincere e ci hanno provato fino alla fine
7895331 hanno dato il loro contributo anche totti dopo l infortunio ha dato quello che mi aspettavo il mercato dobbiamo concentrare la nostra attenzione su giocatori che possibile prendere senza fare un nome preciso ma siamo tranquilli anche con gli elementi a disposizione
7895332 mourinho lha sostituito e non c stato nessuno che in conferenza gli abbia chiesto perch avesse tolto mancini mentre qui tutti lo chiedevano
7895333 non lha scossa sempre la testa e se pure lavesse scossa si dovr tenere conto anche della sua prestazione lui dopo essere stato sostituito da mourinho gli ha dato il cinque l sta alla scelta del giornalista se dare attenzione al comportamento fine a se stesso o al contributo che ha dato alla squadra
7895334 non ci ho ancora parlato anche l dipende dal taglio che si vuol dare alla cosa ho letto che spalletti vuole fare il duro ma ho solo fatto il mio lavoro non ho litigato con nessuno n stimolato nessuno come qualcuno ha riportato perch gli fa comodo e chiaro che se un giocatore dice che se non gioca va via lallenatore non pu far altro che allontanarlo

7895354 the midori incubation developed under eric rudder and thats basically taking the concepts of singularity which is a totally managed net collected os and investigating ways to make the operating system really scalable across different nodes and asynchronous responsive and theyve got this asynchronous programming model theyre building on top of that
7895355 as far as the future of windows and windows being something not based on what windows is today im working in windows im not working in midori im not working in some other incubation so i think that kind of answers the question right there about what i think will happen to windows and that is that the future will be windows of some kind
7895356 it just doesnt make sense to me what amazes me is that people just say lets throw everything away and start over because theres so much thats been invested in things that are in windows
7895357 if you look at how much work has been put into the kernel the windows kernel is in my opinion and the numbers back this up the most scalable kernel the one that supports the most drivers of any kernel hardware devices than any kernel on the planet if you just focus on the pc hardware and server class hardware
7895358 and thats just a huge investment a huge asset that weve got and i dont think that it makes sense to just toss that it does a great job and its not perfect and theres no kernel thats perfect or os thats perfect but thats probably million of man years of work thats gone into tuning it and designing it and implementing it

7895557 few writers have summed up as concisely or intelligently the fundamentals of classical music the interdependence of harmony rhythm volume and speed or applied them so persuasively to the most intractable political issue of the postmodern world
7895558 barenboim describes brilliantly the way music works and the way in which its intricacies and logic justify his faith that everything is connected

7895698 it would be enormously presumptuous to say were going to be the basel of asia but the standards that were trying to push here and emulate are those of the armory or basel on a smaller scale
7895699 all the international art world knows that asia is beginning to be a major player and will be even more so
7895700 galleries artists museums want to be in this part of the world but they dont know it so for us its a perfect opportunity to work with them to be their outpost
7895701 there are a lot of opportunities here from a business point of view but there is also a real interest for everyone to get together more importantly the art world has started to globalize
7895702 were no longer talking about china as a separate market or indonesia as a separate market and no artist wishes to be referred to as an asian artist they just want to be part of the international art community
7895703 the freeport is a huge asset to the development of the art market here
7895704 there will be huge secure warehouses with no duty or taxes paid a place for people to park their art safely for as long as they want and in total confidentiality

7895706 sometimes the debate had the tenor of a late night conversation in a college dormitory during that precious window of time after the pot has been smoked but before the pizza has arrived
7895707 many of the unkind clich s about british dental care
7895708 learning about cricket in middle age is like studying mandarin an effort best left to scholars optimists and members of the foreign service
7895709 the conversation was so much better than it would have been in new york there was no chatter on the topics of my therapeutic epiphany for instance or my hamptons traffic nightmare no one was bragging about his accomplishments or being earnest about her problems they were dropping the sort of witty offhand remarks that make listening to britons in full humorous mode one of lifes great pleasures
7895710 if aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7895711 two people living with her are also refusing food the international communitys immediate action is necessary
7895712 there have been rumours like this before which have turned out not to be true but given the way gambari seems to favour the regime one could imagine that she is feeling very frustrated
7895713 gambari does not have the respect of the military regime and is seen as biased by the democracy movement it is hard to see how he can carry on as un envoy
7895714 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7895715 offering local friendly and technically competent advice to our customers has always been our fundamental strength
7895716 with the launch of many new and exciting modules in the fourth generation of the medusa product suite especially in the area of plant and installation design and the success of stheno pro as a valuable tool for non associative drafting among pro engineer users value added resellers all over the world are jumping aboard
7895717 this month we are pleased to welcome nihon medsystem corporation which provides best in class solutions to engineers throughout japan
7895718 no matter which corner of the globe you visit design engineers have much in common they need competent advice backed by reliable efficient integrated tools that work the way engineers do freeing rather than restricting creativity
7895719 we are very pleased to extend our relationship with the riverdogs organization and the city of charleston for an additional four years
7895720 the outstanding commitment from the charleston riverdogs to the development of our young players is imperative to generating the next class of yankee greats
7895721 we are both pleased and excited to renew the relationship between the charleston riverdogs and new york yankees
7895722 the yankees are a first class organization all the way through and if the next four years are as successful as the past four this will be another win win situation for us and the yankees
7895723 i knew several years ago at hudson valleys hot stove banquet when brian cashman was the speaker that we wanted to build a relationship with the yankees
7895724 brian stayed afterwards took pictures and signed autographs for hundreds of fans and it was clear right then that with that kind of class demonstrated by a general manager of a major league organization it was the right thing to partner with the yankees
7895725 it has been a great relationship thus far and i expect that the next four years will be even better
7895726 the entire material leaves a bitter taste in the mouth about the goings on in the bmw case there is no manner of doubt whatsoever that there was complicity between mr khan and mr anand there can be absolutely no doubt that mr khan and mr anand were somehow or the other more than mixed up in the bmw case
7895727 mr anand and mr khan are prohibited from appearing in this court delhi high court or courts subordinate to it for four months from today however they are free to discharge their professional duties in terms of consultation advice conferences opinions etc
7895728 the unshakeable truth is that mr anand is guilty of criminal contempt of court
7895729 mr anand has held many prestigious elective positions in the legal fraternity including the bar council of delhi he has also been a member of the rajya sabha
7895730 perhaps the reason why he was appointed special public prosecutor in the bmw case
7895731 betrayed the trust that prosecution reposed in him what he did was perhaps beyond the realm of contemplation of the prosecuting agency
7895732 we are not dealing with a young lawyer who driven by ambition and desire transgresses the limits or unwittingly or unknowingly commits criminal contempt we are dealing with senior advocates who are expected to conduct themselves as gentlemen and role models for younger members of the bar
7895733 some influential persons were trying to shift the focus on her to save the real accused
7895734 let any agency prove that i talked to sanjeev bansal on phone either on that day or any day in the past one month
7895735 i am ready to face all consequences if this allegation is found true i have had no dealings with bansal i have not received any money from bansal or any of his associates i am sure i will get justice
7895736 cant a judge buy legal property let the police or any other investigating agency prove that the money for the deal was provided by bansal or singh
7895737 cant a judge buy legal property let the police or any other investigating agency prove that the money for the deal was provided by sanjeev bansal or ravinder singh
7895738 bansal failed to give a detailed account of the cash he produced some papers pertaining to some property in panchkula but that did not carry any weight our investigations caught him on the wrong foot and therefore we booked him along with two others under the prevention of corruption act and criminal conspiracy
7895739 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7895740 we have higher non performing loans against those property related portfolios because they are carrying more risk
7895741 were likely to slow lending to new property developments because in the current environment i think that feasibility cases wont stack up
7895742 while suncorp management acknowledged that the credit environment was likely to worsen it doesnt look like they have provided for this in advance
7895743 non performing loans will continue to go up as will losses
7895744 by the little with which the human spirit is satisfied we can judge the extent of its loss
7895745 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
7895746 thanks to the powerful impulse given to thought by the french revolution hegel anticipated the general movement of science but because it was only an anticipation although by a genius it received from hegel an idealistic character hegel operated with ideological shadows as the ultimate reality marx demonstrated that the movement of these ideological shadows reflected nothing but the movement of material bodies
7895747 my dialectic method is not only different from the hegelian but is its direct opposite to hegel the life process of the human brain i e the process of thinking which under the name of the idea he even transforms into an independent subject is the demiurgos of the real world and the real world is only the external phenomenal form of the idea with me on the contrary the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought
7895748 all three are developed by hegel in his idealist fashion as mere laws of thought the first in the first part of his logic in the doctrine of being the second fills the whole of the second and by far the most important part of his logic the doctrine of essence finally the third figures as the fundamental law for the construction of the whole system the mistake lies in the fact that these laws are foisted on nature and history as laws of thought and not deduced from them this is the source of the whole forced and often outrageous treatment the universe willy nilly is made out to be arranged in accordance with a system of thought which itself is only the product of a definite stage of evolution of human thought if we turn the thing round then everything becomes simple and the dialectical laws that look so extremely mysterious in idealist philosophy at once become simple and clear as noonday
7895749 requires the concurrence of 4 starting of course with heinz dieterich himself
7895750 in fact a strange intellectual fashion has gripped much of the global thinking class and the leaders of the left which makes them swing with cheerful frivolity between the positions of a crude 19th century empiricism and the recent fallacies of postmodernism enriched with old quasi anarchistic formulas and a false pose of agnostic scepticism
7895751 the second pole of the alleged contradiction the prescription of not falling into grandiose long term global prophecies has made us suddenly regress to the ideology of metanarratives and the grand narratives of bourgeois postmodernism which with its complete lack of substance does not merit further discursive consideration
7895752 you hang out a sheeps head and sell dogs meat
7895753 dont be so vulgar we are still looking for the new ideas and if we never find them it doesnt matter since ideology is only a false consciousness
7895754 it might look as though we were denying consciousness any decisive role in the process of history it is true that the conscious reflexes of the different stages of economic growth remain historical facts of great importance it is true that while dialectical materialism is itself the product of this process it does not deny that men perform their historical deeds themselves and that they do so consciously but as engels emphasizes in a letter to mehring this consciousness is false however the dialectical method does not permit us simply to proclaim the falseness of this consciousness and to persist in an inflexible confrontation of true and false on the contrary it requires us to investigate this false consciousness concretely as an aspect of the historical totality and as a stage in the historical process
7895755 all is lost and in a few days the communists will be in power
7895756 unfortunately there is no karl marx or friedrich engels in sight who would have the genius to conceive in hardly three months the critical route to postcapitalist society as they did in the communist manifesto in 1847
7895757 neither is there an albert einstein who in the same space of time in 1905 established the foundations of the postnewtonian world with his papers on quantum theory march and on the theory of relativity june
7895758 lacking these extraordinary thinkers who in a time of record management resolved unknown fundamentals of a virtual reality the anti system future which the rest of the scientists had not even posed we the mortals have to lay our hands on the world spirit hegels famous creature we are not of course speaking of theologized or esoteric phantoms but of the collective spirit of humanity in its empiric concreteness
7895759 but how do we use the recourse to the world spirit in practice how do we lay hands on it and what is the functional scientific equivalent of the mystical divine communions of the catholic prayer and the eucharist in this mission of evolving the socialist theory of the 21st century
7895760 marx said that humanity only poses tasks which are in a condition to be solved this affirmation is correct because hidden in the conscience or pre conscience which permits the question we will find the answer
7895761 in the social production of their existence men inevitably enter into definite relations which are independent of their will namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production
7895762 in studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production which can be determined with the precision of natural science and the legal political religious artistic or philosophic in short ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out
7895763 mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation
7895764 only poses tasks which are in a condition to be solved
7895765 the mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social political and intellectual life it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their consciousness
7895766 is intimately linked to the present problem of cuban transition
7895767 it constitutes together with the cybernetic problem of party state one of their two deeper roots
7895768 the reason for this mediocrity it shares with latin american philosophy both are born of the mystification of the historical truth they are in marxs sense ideology that is objectively false consciousness
7895769 is the daughter of the foundation myth of the creole elite which is based on three great historic lies a the discovery by the europeans b the homo novo produced by the mestizo culture c the evangelising mission of the catholic church
7895770 smoke rises the mist is spreading weep my friends and know that by their deeds we have lost our history
7895771 i stayed in europe for more than twenty years i worked in an industrial chemistry laboratory attended some secret socialist oriented meetings studied a little literature learned languages and directed a reading and writing school in a small russian town
7895772 1 the universe has only two modes of existence as substance matter and as energy
7895773 the discussions on idealism and realism or materialism more and more acquire the character of academic extravagances before the evidences elaborated by science before the wonderful discovery of the big bang about the origin of the macrocosm made up of visible and invisible matter dark matter crossed by gravitation waves einstein with stellar constant times of expansion hubble and black holes the microcosmic deciphering of the plans of construction of biological systems written in the chemical language of four characters a t c g of dna the logic of the chaotic behaviour of the individual gas molecule that nevertheless coexists perfectly well with the macroscopic laws of perfect gases the logic of the behaviour of human social systems that resembles the quantum logic of the behaviour of microcosmic phenomena to a great extent the cylindrical form of the universe and the interaction between space time gravitation discovered by einstein the visibility of an atom under the electron microscope and the observation by means of techniques of crystallography of an aids virus attacking a cell of the human organism the imagenology imagenolog a of mental processes and the passage of qualitative or conceptual analyses of mental states like joy anger humour depression etc towards quantitative biochemical analysis and remedies the calculation of time by means of clocks that register the cesium atoms that vibrate 9 2 billion times per second in short before the accumulation of that objective knowledge of reality the insistence of the old discussions of the philosophers only can seem nonsense
7895774 retreated in quest of fashionable reactionary philosophical doctrines captivated by the tinsel of the so called last word in european science and unable to discern beneath this tinsel some variety of servility to the bourgeoisie to bourgeois prejudice and bourgeois reaction
7895775 for our attitude towards this phenomenon to be a politically conscious one it must be realised that no natural science and no materialism can hold its own in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of the bourgeois world outlook unless it stands on solid philosophical ground in order to hold his own in this struggle and carry it to a victorious finish the natural scientist must be a modern materialist a conscious adherent of the materialism represented by marx i e he must be a dialectical materialist
7895776 the discussions on idealism and realism or materialism are academic extravagances
7895777 it is in fact the wish for rational insight not the ambition to amass a mere heap of acquisitions that should be presupposed in every case as possessing the mind of the learner in the study of science
7895778 modern natural scientists if they know how to seek and if we learn to help them will find in the hegelian dialectics materialistically interpreted a series of answers to the philosophical problems which are being raised by the revolution in natural science and which make the intellectual admirers of bourgeois fashion
7895779 unless it sets itself such a task and systematically fulfils it materialism cannot be militant materialism it will be not so much the fighter as the fought to use an expression of shchedrins without this eminent natural scientists will as often as hitherto be helpless in making their philosophical deductions and generalizations for natural science is progressing so fast and is undergoing such a profound revolutionary upheaval in all spheres that it cannot possibly dispense with philosophical deductions
7895780 with the paradigm of the big bang that explains and dates the existence of the universe in the region of 16 billion years with this set of knowledge the insistence on the priority of the idea in the behaviour of the universe or as a quality ontologically separated sic from the substance is simply infantile in scientific terms god is a placebo produced by the existential anguish of the human being and in no way different from other forms of autosuggestion and mental projection of homo sapiens that this placebo has become good business for the theological bureaucracies who live on it or also for many philosophers who live on mysticism does not change the situation at all
7895781 it was indeed the rejection of marx and engels of the application of newtonian determinism that is suitable for the description and explanation of mechanical motion which is the simplest of all changes but not for explaining a complex dynamic system sdc like society which allowed them to develop a political scientific perspective sui generis which was the only one possible to obtain their extraordinary striving after a new historical project of the majorities of their time
7895782 the motion of matter is not merely crude mechanical motion mere change of place it is heat and light electric and magnetic tension chemical combination and dissociation life and finally consciousness
7895783 newtonian attraction and centrifugal force an example of metaphysical thinking the problem not solved but only posed and this preached as the solution
7895784 newtonian gravitation the best that can be said of it is that it does not explain but pictures the present state of planetary motion the motion is given ditto the force of attraction of the sun with these data how is the motion to be explained by the parallelogram of forces by a tangential force which now becomes a necessary postulate that we must accept that is to say assuming the eternal character of the existing state we need a first impulse god but neither is the existing planetary state eternal nor is the motion originally compound but simple rotation and the parallelogram of forces applied here is wrong because it did not merely make evident the unknown magnitude the x that had still to be found that is to say in so far as newton claimed not merely to put the question but to solve it
7895785 indeed the 19th century produced a brilliant expos from a source that will no doubt surprise most readers frederick engels
7895786 engels considers three essential features of human evolution speech a large brain and upright posture he argues that the first step must have been a descent from the trees with subsequent evolution to upright posture by our ground dwelling ancestors these apes when moving on level ground began to drop the habit of using their hands and to adopt a more and more erect gait this was the decisive step in the transition from ape to man upright posture freed the hand for using tools labour in engels terminology increased intelligence and speech came later
7895787 deeply rooted bias of western thought predisposes us to look for continuity and gradual change
7895788 in the first place it is necessary to distinguish between limited statements of regional and temporary scope decimon nicos and universal statements in addition to that evaluation in space and time it is necessary to take into account secondly that new objective realities exist that either did not exist in the days of marx and engels or were relatively unimportant e g ecology and that therefore must be integrated into the new historical project of the majorities thirdly the advance of the sciences and their epistemology allows us to determine the correct methodology of the analysis of marx and engels without violating the structural elements of the procedures of the most advanced contemporary science and not from the scientific interpretations of the reality of the 19th century that marx and engels had at their disposal fourthly it is necessary to develop a new discourse un nuevo discurso not only as far as content is concerned but with respect to its forms finally it will be necessary to integrate the arts aesthetics et cetera in the transforming of the new historical project of the majorities of the 21st century
7895789 striving after a new historical project of the majorities of their time
7895790 violating the structural elements of the procedures of the most advanced contemporary science
7895791 related to this problem of the abolition or trivialization of the great questions of philosophy this problem of the complexity of the great paradigms of the natural sciences that makes their adequate philosophical interpretation practically impossible for people who do not have a deep and solid formation in the physical mathematical sciences and increasingly of molecular biology it is obvious that to be able to infer on sic the not strictly scientific implications of knowledge such as the cylindrical form of the universe the concept of space time the curvature of space time by fields of gravitation et cetera one has first to dominate the respective scientific disciplines
7895792 only on the base of a solid knowledge of this type is it possible to try to transpose the logics sic concepts and interpretative methods used as it were in theoretical physics to other fields of investigation like for example the sciences of society not to dominate the complex physical mathematical paradigms and to give nevertheless lessons and lectures on its implicit meaning for politics aesthetics and ethics means simply to want to take the second step before taking the first a procedure that can only finish in the quackery of nebulous speech senseless analogies and a pretence of precision where the pseudo knowledge reigns
7895793 the historical attempts to build fairer societies have been in a sense attempts against common sense
7895794 there was not of course any another way possible faced with ignorance about human nature good intentions and religious and metaphysical speculations and in methodology the advance through trial and error had to take the place of the firmer basis of a conscious and planned evolution of society despite this stick and string way of progressing limited to the wisdom of empirical experience and just one step ahead of the thinking of a savage the last millennia have seen considerable progress in many aspects of human existence today however the task can be addressed more efficiently with more realism and optimism than at any time in the past because we have begun to systematically understand the two key elements of the human enigma its genome and its neural system
7895795 the two key elements of the human enigma its genome and its neural system

7895801 las acciones de rusia en semanas recientes ponen en duda el compromiso de rusia con la paz y la seguridad en el c ucaso
7895802 no contribuye a crear las condiciones necesarias para la soluci n del conflicto
7895803 lamento la decisi n del presidente ruso dimitri medv dev ha dicho el ministro de exteriores frank walter steinmeier en declaraciones que publica ma ana el diario
7895804 es un paso que lesiona la integridad de un pa s soberano y para nosotros no es aceptable
7895805 reafirma la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia
7895806 esto es contrario a las obligaciones contra das reiteradamente por rusia en las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu esto no ayuda a mejorar las perspectivas de paz en el c ucaso
7895807 todas las resoluciones previas del consejo de seguridad de la onu han apoyado la integridad territorial y la plena soberan a de georgia esta ha sido y sigue siendo nuestra posici n
7895808 desproporcionada y contraria con su papel de mantenimiento de la paz

7895812 one of the assumptions that people make is that if they buy virus protecting software that will protect them from all known viruses
7895813 that may well be true but theres an awful lot out there that we dont know about
7895814 so designing more effective systems and designing security models to ensure that we dont have these problems is what the course is based around
7895815 in the industry we refer to people with white hats and black hats which comes from the old westerns
7895816 but realistically were very careful about the people we take onto the program
7895817 el resultado me deja profundamente satisfecho porque el primer objetivo que me plante era no hacer una pel cula de turista que le faltara el respeto a colombia ese era el reto m s grande
7895818 la pel cula trasciende su propia an cdota no se queda en colombia no s lo por su calidad t cnica y art stica sino por su propuesta muy aterrizada en la psicolog a del secuestrado los hechos m s fuertes ocurren en el interior del personaje
7895819 no m s basta ya del secuestro y de la guerra no nada m s en colombia sino en el mundo entero
7895820 conoc a desmovilizados a reinsertados entren militarmente casi tres meses con el ej rcito para lograr el personaje estuve en zona de conflicto muy cerca de gente afectada por el secuestro
7895821 retratar una realidad as para cualquier sociedad es impactante y puede servir como un catalizador para que las cosas tomen un rumbo diferente
7895822 rafa lara conoc a a aterciopelados desde m xico seg n nos cont le encantaba el grupo le gustaba mucho el sonido y pens en nosotros
7895823 lo conectaron con nosotros nos reunimos nos mostr la pel cula le contamos que ten amos una canci n que todav a no hab a sido editada que iba a estar en el pr ximo disco que la ve amos perfecta para la pel cula l la puso de prueba hablamos con la disquera y ya
7895824 vemos cambios en el sonido de aterciopelados en las estructuras de las canciones y eso est ch vere andrea canta de otras maneras y eso nos gusta mucho
7895825 tecos ha venido jugando bien sobre todo fuera de su casa a eso hay que ponerle mucha atenci n porque tienen jugadores muy buenos aunque en general se desempe an de buena manera y nosotros debemos estar atentos en todas las l neas
7895826 que lo tomen como ellos quieran para nosotros es un partido m s ante un adversario que es del mismo grupo
7895827 esperemos seguir ganando y por el mismo camino debemos tener calma y esperando jugar como ante chivas por lo que estamos tranquilos en ese sentido
7895828 the price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or american heritage as a negative is i collect your fucking head
7895829 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
7895830 we looked at it through our nmr machine and were amazed by what we saw fluid rushed calcium out of the bioglass and then into the new bones it seems perhaps a glass of milk a day really is what the doctor ordered
7895831 por lo que no puede faltar la figura del diablo que con sus travesuras viene a dar pie a la presentaci n de la guaranducha al tiempo que act a como narrador de la misma
7895832 it is clear that the nsidc graph is correct and that 2008 arctic ice is barely 10 above last year just as nsidc had stated
7895833 becoming ever more apparent that reality is throwing a bucket of cold water on the idea of anthropogenic global warming
7895834 the blessed algore may someday he gain some intelligence bought all those carbon credits from himself
7895835 if you repeat something long enough it eventually becomes true
7895836 we want to make a strong statement with these vans that they are reliable great value and very cool rather than trying to grab attention with offensive pictures and slogans the only thing wicked about these chubbys is the price
7895837 we know that backpackers want to explore in something that they can tell their mates back home about and show off in photos so we developed some pretty unique body decals for these vans add to this the fact that the chubbys are basically brand new extremely comfortable and just about the cheapest budget van on the road and there is no real reason to rent something that looks smells and drives a lot worse
7895838 these things are like a private room on wheels and they actually cost less than a private room in a hostel its taken a long time to build up our reputation within the backpacker industry and adding high quality great value products to our fleet sits perfectly with our image the backpacker campervan industry has suffered some bad press lately but we are determined not to be tarred with the same brush
7895839 the presentation by professor thompson is expected to report data from the completed phase 1 clinical trial as well as providing an update on the current phase 2 study
7895840 professor thompson is one of the worlds foremost authorities on melanoma treatment and the global lead investigator for our pv 10 clinical trials
7895841 we announced recently that the first twenty five percent 20 of 80 of melanoma subjects have been treated in the phase 2 study with enrollment continuing at centers in brisbane and sydney australia and at the m d anderson cancer center in houston tx we expect to announce additional sites in australia and the u s in the coming months

7895844 riordan was banned for a year after an altercation outside berlin that was increased to two years after he tried to get into espionage
7895845 riordan managed to get into the club at about 11pm but one of the bar staff saw him and knew he was banned
7895846 our door stewards approached him to ask him to leave and they got a mouthful of abuse
7895847 he was going on about how they thought they were
7895848 it went on for a few minutes but he left before he had to be ejected we dont want him in espionage
7895849 we stick very strictly to the unight scheme for the protection of our staff and customers its a great scheme
7895850 i could be wrong as grandmothers only hear the good stuff but thats not like him
7895851 hes a quiet lad and not a fighter ive not heard anything about this
7895852 you always hear about trouble in nightclubs but he wouldnt be part of that
7895853 polands veno automotive has released images of its yet to be named supercar but it may as well be called the lamborghini reventon ii veno claims that its supercar has a unique design and surprise surprise was inspired by fighter jets just as the reventon was
7895854 oleme olukorras kus demokraatlikel riikidel lasub vastutus teha iged otsused mis suurendaksid meie k igi turvalisust

7895860 no one has yet to put together an end to end persistent search offering that enables consumer friendly comprehensive real time automatic updates across multiple distribution channels at a viable cost
7895861 generating a personal view of the web for each and every person is computationally expensive and thus does not scale at all
7895862 this is why you dont have personalized google results we just dont have the cpu cycles to care about you
7895863 they are in plague and nuisance proportions sitting in trees and the paths are literally covered with slimy bird droppings and affecting public use of grounds
7895864 the most effective way to manage the problem was to remove the lower limbs of trees to deter the birds from nesting
7895865 allegations council staff wrung the necks of birds in an unauthorised cull is absolutely untrue
7895866 the cmc as a governing body would be looking at issues of official misconduct or if the internal disciplinary action was deemed appropriate
7895867 for 160 years weve had a physical response to every issue this will give members of the public the option of making a complaint over the phone without a crew being deployed
7895868 things like vandalising a letterbox stealing items from cars there are many hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be handled over the phone
7895869 keeping in mind that the majority of pensioners are single and living by themselves they would feel a lot more comfortable and secure knowing their complaint would not be handled by a call centre
7895870 i believe that the report clearly shows the expenditure has been kept as low as possible while ensuring that staff do receive the pay rises that they are entitled to
7895871 if we dont act now were going to be in a crisis situation
7895872 i dont think they should be hiding the figures it would be irresponsible to be running an unsafe system i hope that is not happening he said
7895873 if it got out that the system was unsafe people would be leaving public transportation in droves and the highways would become even more crowded
7895874 its just a matter of pumping money into the service it can be done
7895875 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7895876 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7895877 it makes bhps bid look better it was looking fine before but it looks even better now
7895878 its going to be hard for rio to make a concerted push from here to argue that they are undervalued
7895879 and the divisions that did the best relatively speaking were iron ore and coal particularly in australia where they have a good affinity with bhps assets

7895888 we are honored that lilly ledbetter will address the democratic convention
7895889 the fact that women are paid less than their male coworkers for doing the same job is unacceptable in the 21st century and counter to both the progress weve made and our shared values as americans lilly ledbetters case before the supreme court has once again awakened the nation to this discrimination and its time we join together to right this wrong and pay women equal pay for equal work
7895890 the theme of tuesday nights program is renewing americas promise and there is no more critical promise that we can keep to american women than to ensure pay equity
7895891 there is a clear difference between the parties when it comes to pay equity and this election could not be more critical when it comes to garnering support for reversing the supreme courts recent 5 4 decision in the ledbetter v goodyear case as american women are called upon to do more and more for their families with less and less resources coming in the least we can do is to ensure pay equity
7895892 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7895893 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7895894 we invested in a lot of crummy companies with no business models

7895900 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7895901 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behaviour
7895902 the north south direction facilitates the running of the magnetic currents of the poles through your body
7895903 from head to toe and toe to head the way your bodys current runs rather than across your body as when your bed is situated east west
7895904 at the moment i am trying to write something finish something i cant seem to muster the passion and im not the biggest fan of my writing right now nor of myself im filled with doubt and questions concerning a need for honesty what seems honest one day seems pretense the next it is a confusion of great distraction i am between two worlds and without footing in either perhaps this is where it ends without knowledge without truth only the intentional decisions we make from word to word from moment to moment
7895905 much of what i wrote early in my career has proved to be the seeds and reminders of futures to come i have been repeating myself since i can remember and learning to say it in so very many ways until i too could hear it and move on
7895906 i will remember you with every gentle breeze and with every drop of rain
7895907 its not really what i was expecting i thought it would be more like a conference and more formal but it was like a sporting event the crowd was so hyped
7895908 he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be and he said that all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations

7895910 in 10 years if the motorsport industry as a whole hasnt engaged in zero or low emission principles it probably wont be around

7895927 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief

7895944 liberal theology creeps across episcopal dioceses for the american family news christian network writes
7895945 episcopal and anglican friends of mine tell me whats happening in the u s is this strong support for the normalization of homosexuality and other strange stuff has been on a diocese by diocese basis
7895946 so there are moderate dioceses out there who say yeah its going on in the church but its not in my diocese and i dont have to worry about it and increasingly its encroaching from one diocese to the next particularly as those who are conservative continue to walk out the door
7895947 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
7895948 in den jahren vor der finanzkrise war es kontinuierlich m glich neue anleihen zu platzieren derzeit sind transaktionen dagegen st rker von einer g nstigen nachrichtenlage abh ngig
7895949 die zeitfenster in denen man anleihen platzieren kann sind k rzer und seltener geworden
7895950 es muss im zweifel schnell gehen eine lange vorlaufzeit mit vierw chiger roadshow und anschlie ender emission wagt derzeit niemand
7895951 wenn sich unternehmen mit aussprechbaren namen und stabilen mittelzufl ssen zu renditen zwischen sechs und acht prozent am markt zeigen dann sind das im moment kaufkurse
7895952 gro e hochzins oder hybridanleiheemissionen wird es vorerst sicherlich nicht geben
7895953 die mehrzahl der neuen bonds haben derzeit laufzeiten zwischen drei und f nf jahren das spricht f r eine gewisse risikoscheu
7895954 der august ist traditionell ein ruhiger monat doch die unternehmen formieren sich bereits f r die zeit nach der sommerpause
7895955 wenn man die renditeaufschl ge neuer anleihen in den usa betrachtet dann kann man schon davon ausgehen dass ein anstieg der transaktionen auch in europa zu h heren renditeaufschl gen f hren wird

7895983 wer die wogen der ver ffentlichten diskussion um das thema verfolgt hat ist m glicherweise berrascht von der gro en akzeptanz die sendungssponsoring de facto bei den fernsehzuschauern hat aber das publikum wurde hierzu bisher auch noch nicht geh rt
7895984 die berschaubar wenigen und kurzen spon sorhinweise im abendprogramm von ard und zdf und die allgegenw rtig keit von werbung und sponsoring im t glichen leben lassen bei den zu schauern kein st rgef hl aufkommen
7895985 wir finden eindeu tige belege dass sponsoring von den fernsehzuschauern weitgehend als integraler und normaler bestandteil des programms wahrgenommen wird und das gilt auch f r zuschauer die bevorzugt ard und zdf sehen
7895986 letztlich sind es die fernsehzu schauer die derartige sponsorhinweise anschauen und die wir befragen m ssen
7895987 jetzt haben wir auch nachvollziehbares und umfangreiches zah lenmaterial dass sich unsere zuschauer nicht von sponsoringhinweisen ge st rt f hlen

7895990 the report shows a 19 percent decrease in opium cultivation to 157 000 hectares down from a record harvest of 193 000 in 2007

7896136 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it

7896154 results to date for the 2009 financial year have remained solid and tracking well ahead of last year
7896155 based on current trading conditions the outlook for the full year is for strong earnings and cashflow generation to continue across the business
7896156 there is some evidence of some slowing in the discretionary consumer expenditure part of the market but to date that hasnt had a serious impact on our volumes

7896160 theyve taken a leaf out of the book of rural press which is renowned for being hard on costs
7896161 fairfax has said the staff cuts are a response to structural changes in the industry rather than cyclical suggesting that declining print advertising revenue is behind the cuts at the newspapers
7896162 it is all very well to say what savings the company expects to make but earnings guidance for the 2009 financial year should also be given
7896163 i think with hindsight now any transaction done last year would be viewed as expensive

7896171 some of the technologies required to meet the 20 per cent reduction targets by 2020 require a large change in the base plate that produces energy for victoria and australia
7896172 some of the technology is not there at the moment and i think it would take another five or seven years before its at the commercial stage
7896173 at that point we know that a base plate plant takes around seven years to construct and become operational
7896174 while the industry is embracing clean coal technology the amount of money required is much much greater than what weve already seen

7896239 the name macarenses comes from the book utopia by thomas more published in 1516 macarenses is a land not far from utopia itself and is translated as happiland from makar meaning happy of course i have used this name as a pun on our present state of affairs
7896240 the website is not just my artwork but it is a storehouse of inspirations packed from floor to ceiling with words and images ranging from found items to collectable objects there are book lists web links information on artists and much much more
7896241 they were all so skinny they were all the same
7896242 it is the humanitarian communitys obligation to see that the humanitarian needs are fulfilled
7896243 the humanitarian community has not been able to fully support what was jointly established
7896244 it was a very short sighted strategy because they did not have the reserves to respond
7896245 in follow up inspections since the accident the steel inside some of the jersey walls has corroded we have found voids and corrosion of steel elements
7896246 this is not a game about a cool hero for details please calmly refer to the information inside
7896247 given the companys recent performance the board concluded that shopnbc needs a different kind of leadership and vision todays actions are in the best interests of the company its shareholders customers employees and vendors
7896248 a loan is nonperforming when payments of interest and principal are past due by 90 days or more or at least 90 days of interest payments have been capitalized refinanced or delayed by agreement or payments are less than 90 days overdue but there are other good reasons to doubt that payments will be made in full
7896249 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7896250 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7896251 i find madonnas attempt to compare john mccain with hitler beyond the pale and an insult to all americans democrats as well as republicans
7896252 there ought to be no place in the political and social discourse of american culture for such deliberate distortions and lies sure to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of young people around the world
7896253 comparisons to hitler have no place in a music concert or in the presidential campaign
7896254 whatever madonnas political or personal views it is outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy or to make a comment on american political leadership
7896255 doing so trivializes the history of the holocaust and is an insult to the memories of the victims and their families
7896256 when many minnesotans cant afford to go on vacation because of high gas prices congressman walz shouldnt vote to give himself one minnesotans deserve to have a government that works with industry and the people to move our economy forward like the majority of americans and in contrast to congressman walz i strongly support offshore drilling and drilling in alaska it makes no sense that canada and mexico are open for offshore drilling and we close the majority of our shores to responsible development congressman walz could have cast a bipartisan vote to get the job done and stay in washington to pass needed energy legislation instead he chooses time and time again to deny a floor debate on this important issue minnesotans deserve better
7896257 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7896258 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7896259 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7896260 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7896261 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7896262 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7896263 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7896264 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7896265 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7896266 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7896267 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7896268 you are vintersorg you think you are a badass but you are really a pretentious twit
7896269 it was a very snappy practice very well organized there was a lot of spirit a lot of camaraderie make no mistake everyone on the field knew where coach pelini was at all times and from what i can tell the players really identify with him
7896270 bob was a fiery irishman and you can just tell that bo is somewhat tempermental too
7896271 whenever referees made questionable calls or non calls in his view coach devaney defended his players he supported us in almost all areas whether we were dealing with sportswriters professors or critical fans he did not hesitate to give constructive criticism when he thought we deserved it but when any of us were criticized by others outside the program he was always there to defend us i think coach pelini appears like coach devaney in that regard in my view so far coach pelini has the same general overt loyalty and support for his players that coach devaney provided for us
7896272 when devaney and his staff came here in 62 nebraska hadnt won a conference football championship since 1940
7896273 there were great expectations for a coach and a staff from a state that really didnt know what big red football was all about yet but that staff won big eight titles in 1963 64 65 and 66 i was there from 62 through 66 and yes devaney had a staff that he allowed to run the program because he trusted them yet he always knew what each coach was doing whether he came into a group session or decided to observe different drills i think devaney will be smiling this week as the new era opens and nebraska football gets back on track
7896274 there was incredible loyalty between bob and his coaching staff and bob and his players
7896275 i havent seen enough to know for sure thats whats going to happen between bo and his staff and between him and his players but everything you see hear and read seems to point to that
7896276 devaney always believed you win with defense and by controlling the football
7896277 i think thats what youre going to see with pelini too even though were going to run the spread offense and i think run it very well coach pelini spent a lot of time with the offense during the practice we watched id love to hear some of his brainstorms with sean watson
7896278 when you insult anyone on this team you likely insult everyone
7896279 i dont think youre going to see any 70 something to 30 something games this year
7896280 i remember being on the scout team in 1967 wayne meylan nebraskas two time all american middle guard in 1966 67 was the leader of our blackshirts and they would knock us around when wed run the other teams plays they were expected to dominate those drills in fact if we ran a successful play during a drill theyd have us run the same play again so the black shirts knew how to stop it
7896281 i love seeing barney cotton and marvin sanders and jeff jamrog guys who played here back on that coaching staff
7896282 i love seeing ron brown on the field bringing that incredible passion back that wed lost everyone on that coaching staff knows the new basic mission to create a great college football program again a program based on discipline trust and a faith in each other every day all year long
7896283 out of state players will come here to fight for a job and become part of one of the greatest traditions in all of college football
7896284 and guess what when that time comes to be a pro theyll be better prepared for the nfl than they would be almost anywhere else
7896285 injuries are taking their toll on nfl players from the 1950s 60s and 70s
7896286 were seeing post concussion syndromes joint replacement surgeries and arthritic conditions that we pro football players never anticipated at the time we were playing
7896287 it never gets publicized but weve had research that shows almost 80 percent of players are either divorced or bankrupt two years after they leave the nfl
7896288 its often the result of a hedonistic lifestyle many players choose they played a very violent game where every play was like a car wreck and they seem to take that same fatalistic attitude into their lives outside of football they do things they shouldnt they take business risks they shouldnt sometimes they end up with no funds whatsoever and theyre too proud to ask anyone for help
7896289 that explains the inordinately high number of poor health conditions and financial hardships ex nfl players now face
7896290 even when i played for coach devaney and coach osborne the program was designed to make you a better person
7896291 the priority was to make you a better student and a better athlete coach devaney and coach osborne always supported players who had the ability to play professionally but in my view their primary goal was not to develop pro players they wanted you to develop as a student athlete so you would be successful regardless of what career you selected after football
7896292 theres a lot of focus on winning and championships and money and thats all part of college athletics
7896293 but essentially if your student athletes dont grow and become better people i think its primarily for naught youve simply created people who are great athletes but are totally self serving and you havent really accomplished much
7896294 coach osborne exemplified all the simple important virtues that i just took for granted at the time honesty integrity discipline compassion judgment forgiveness even a wry sense of humor
7896295 after playing in the nfl and following coach osbornes career for all those years i realized that the types of virtues he taught and more importantly practiced throughout his life were often lacking in the other coaches and people ive met over the 43 years that i have now known coach osborne i can say that he has had a more positive impact on my life than any other person more importantly i know he has had an even more positive impact on so many other players coaches and even fans by being such an exemplary role model for others he lives his life and practices his faith as an unpretentious and humble follower of christ but he has never been overbearing about it to anyone
7896296 but i did not make a lot more mistakes or yield to many more temptations not because im virtuous but because i tried to never have coach osborne be embarrassed by my behavior
7896297 i may not have completely succeeded in my goal but i know i could have erred much more if i hadnt tried to follow his example
7896298 but you will be on the scout team throughout the fall it will be no bed of roses but if you work hard well see what you can do
7896299 id stayed out late catching balls after practice that night and i was the only player who hadnt showered
7896300 i was just sitting there holding my head in my hands and asking myself why i keep hitting my head against the wall every day like this i was sitting there thinking i need to quit and quit soon
7896301 as i was staring at the floor i glanced up to see coach devaney walking by my locker we caught each others eye
7896302 he kept going and i thought to myself i bet he doesnt even remember who i am
7896303 you know jim mcfarland ive been watching you in practice if you stick with it and keep working hard youre going to play a lot of football for us next year
7896304 it gave me a real boost because it confirmed everything coach osborne had been telling me
7896305 i think coach devaney identified with me he wasnt a great football player himself at a small college in michigan he knew how hard it was to see the playing field when he saw me slumped over staring at the floor i think he knew exactly what i was thinking
7896306 from that moment forward i knew it didnt matter that i wasnt on scholarship i knew it didnt matter that i was still on the scout team in my third year i was finally on the radar and i was going to put forth every ounce of energy i had in me to validate the talent i had
7896307 coach osborne stressed a total approach to learning the game plan
7896308 we practiced our assignments on the field and we had written tests every friday before the saturday games to make sure that we understood our assignments i always felt when i took the field that no matter what happened during the game i had with coach osbornes teaching and coaching prepared myself as best that i could to play the game
7896309 that applies both to blocking particularly downfield and to running every pass route as if the ball is going to be thrown to you on that particular play even though you might not be the primary receiver
7896310 i know that while america may not be perfect our union can always be perfected
7896311 there are a couple of levels to turning an innocent child into a terrorist
7896312 the first one is pumping him up with hatred the second one is training him with weaponry so that he will feel empowered you put that together with the weaponry and when he grows older he will be a terrorist
7896313 zionists we will strike you anywhere kill you and defeat you until you leave our land
7896314 i began learning how to make bombs and resist the jews when i was 14 years now i am able to make hand grenades and land mines
7896315 now we manufacture a local grenade it is a plastic tube we fill it to the top with tnt and wrap it up with tape and here is the result
7896316 we dont play like other kids because we are a part of
7896317 and it is made by our people here is the ammo clips with bullets in it it can fire here is a sound grenade and this one is an explosive grenade and here is the safety valve
7896318 he feels like he is in control he knows how the weapons work it makes him feel way way beyond his age making him feel like hes going to be a fighter hes going to kill with it
7896319 i always tell people take off your cultural glasses and put on the glasses of the other culture
7896320 you wake up in the morning and you rush to the newspaper to see how your baseball team did last night and these people get up in the morning and theyre praying for the destruction of the christian and jewish worlds replaced by islam that we shall finally win the crusader wars its a different world view

7896322 like so many of you i have a daughter in college and a son not far behind
7896323 i love my job and i have worked hard to get where i am
7896324 if i was the one serving as governor nobody would be asking david he would quit his job
7896325 tighter credit conditions and relatively high inventory levels led to some sharp price declines in the second quarter
7896326 however the majority of metropolitan statistical areas msas posted positive four quarter growth
7896327 the most overbuilt areas of the country including california nevada arizona and florida contrast greatly with most other states where prices are declining more moderately or even increasing
7896328 nationally the substantial declines in the weakest markets have driven seasonally adjusted prices down to late 2005 levels
7896329 there are strong reasons why judges should treat public disobedients more leniently than ordinary offenders and not only when their objections to law or policy are well founded
7896330 unlike radical protesters or ordinary offenders public disobedients are conscientiously motivated
7896331 often their protests serve the interests of society by forcing a necessary reexamination of moral boundaries
7896332 when breakdowns in the mechanisms for citizen engagement in the decision making process occur public disobedience offers one way to rectify these democratic deficits by focusing attention on a neglected issue
7896333 i hope to show that principled or public motivations generally lessen the seriousness of a breach of law even when the cause championed through the disobedience is poorly founded
7896334 i will not leave this program now that i am platinum

7896343 the upcoming wave of expected retirements may be a tsunami as some predict or it may have the erosive effect of a constant crashing of smaller waves upon the beach
7896344 filming of big budget movies has ground to a virtual halt across the city and much of the county a slowdown partly driven by scheduling decisions studios made a year ago to prepare for a possible actors strike

7896441 the adtas new offices are in the chinese capital beijing and the countrys largest and third largest most populous cities shanghai and guangzhou
7896442 a number of factors led us to prioritise china in our five year overseas promotion strategy including the sheer size of the outbound chinese market the propensity of the chinese tourist for culture and substantial air links between beijing and abu dhabi
7896443 chinese government figures prove the republic is now the largest outbound market in asia with chinese travelers accounting for 40 95 million overseas trips last year which was an 18 6 per cent rise on the previous year
7896444 this is estimated to rise to a staggering 100 million international trips by 2020 when abu dhabi will be counted among one of the worlds leading cultural destinations
7896445 we have to get into this vast market now build destination awareness and prepare our audience well before the opening of some of the worlds leading cultural institutions in abu dhabi
7896446 through familiarisation trips and regular trade workshops and by working closely with the uae embassy in china we hope to facilitate the start of group leisure travel from china

7896455 there were three or four hundred people on the sidewalk perfectly within their rights to be on the sidewalk we were illegally detained and we may bring suit against the city

7896457 we had minors in there we had older people in there they were scared and i dont blame them and there was no reason for this no reason in the world

7896461 the authors concluded that in combination with standard treatments consumption of omega 3 fatty acids may provide a nontoxic means to improve cancer treatment outcomes and may slow or prevent recurrence of cancer they added omega 3 supplementation may constitute a useful alternative therapy for patients who are not candidates for standards toxic cancer therapies
7896462 the scientists concluded omega 3 supplement use is associated with better cognitive aging if associations with omega 3 content are causal optimization of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acid intakes could improve retention of cognitive function in old age

7896489 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7896490 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7896491 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently

7896494 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm but she has every right in fact an obligation to engage secular authority and to challenge those wielding it to live the demands of justice in this sense the catholic church cannot stay has never stayed and never will stay out of politics politics involves the exercise of power the use of power has moral content and human consequences and the well being and destiny of the human person is very much the concern and the special competence of the christian community

7896497 last year the world got hit by a heroin tsunami almost 700 tonnes this year the opium flood waters have started to recede
7896498 if helmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7896499 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7896500 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together
7896501 the problem with whats happened over the past few decades is that you have a whole generation of kids who have no brand loyalty theyve grown up on honda hyundai kia and toyota to lure them to the american brand youve got to give them something exciting something bold something different america does technology well and i think this is how the companies will bring those buyers back i think cars like the chevy volt which is entirely battery powered or hydrogen cars from chrysler ford and g m will take off
7896502 in matters of religion as of art there are no
7896503 im not repeat not saying social context is the most important value

7896505 i listen to a lot of pop and classical music
7896506 what is and is not in accordance with the score
7896507 on any given night what allows me to get to that higher ground is the audience i look for an audience thats as serious about the experience as we are which after all these years continues to be pretty serious
7896508 daarom zijn we hard aan de slag gegaan om het fundament onder onze family of stations te verstevigen
7896509 met onze krachtige programmering voor het najaar bouwen we stevig verder aan onze profielen en marktaandelen en willen we onze positie in de adverteerdersmarkt verstevigen

7896514 nokia nseries is commited voip services as part of its offering that is why we have included sip stack and improved the developer voip offering in s60 3rd edition feature pack 2 by enhancing the voip apis to improve the call quality as an example
7896515 a nokia voip client is not included with the nokia n78 and the nokia n96 and voip solutions based on this particular client such as gizmo will not work however forum nokia will cooperate with third party developers to support them in porting their applications from s60 3 0 3 1 releases to s60 3 2 one example is fring whose popular application will be offered via nokias download service for the nokia n96
7896516 from truphones perspective nokia has removed the voip client from all the n series phones for the planned future we are putting in a replacement client functionality so that existing customers are not orphaned
7896517 it would seem to me that nokia is bowing to some pressure from the carriers as there is seldom a reason to remove abilities that you already have this probably wont surprise many but it caught me unawares as i thought nokia was above carrier pressure
7896518 a great story is true not necessarily because its factual but because its consistent and authentic consumers are too good at sniffing out inconsistencies for a marketer to get away with a story thats just slapped on
7896519 that is severely impacting our business and is a large factor in terms of where our results are both this quarter and last quarter
7896520 if they are there then that is what the plan would be
7896521 i just feel like the community is not in support of the present board and the election will bear that out
7896522 we do not want to create a superintendent revolving door a district with a record like that always looks like a problem
7896523 we run the risk we would be looked over given the circumstances this school board has been through this past year
7896524 in our case it is particularly troublesome to a new candidate
7896525 we understand the issues and the concerns facing the community this search should go forward
7896526 they may not know how to be a board member let alone the issue im not comfortable with that
7896527 i know i wouldnt have been ready to pick a superintendent a year ago
7896528 ive watched that parade go by ever since i was 5 years old
7896529 now to have this honor is pretty unique it was pretty thrilling when i was a kid seeing the crowd in town for the parade now this one event draws hundreds every year to herscher
7896530 many local festivals have changed over the years but this one has remained the same
7896531 we will be splitting our time between herscher and florida
7896532 while economic development is alive and well throughout kankakee county i am a bit perplexed by the fact that many of the contractors and workers are coming from outside the area
7896533 we need local jobs for local people who get paid area standards with good benefits only then does economic development benefit the entire community and county and not a select few
7896534 i will say that to you and to anyone who comes into this village
7896535 i put them on the pool team and they took it from there
7896536 it was amazing for them even getting through the chicago competition
7896537 dad played for a living for years then he quit and opened up his barbershop and pool hall
7896538 he taught us all how to play and he taught us all to be barbers and how to run the business there was no running the streets for us
7896539 sen ted kennedy stole the show he unified the party and was the defining moment of the convention
7896540 i was really excited to hear michelle obama especially after all the controversy about her
7896541 but i was really excited to see kennedy speak at the convention despite his battle with brain cancer
7896542 i know how hard it was for me to deal with the radiation treatments
7896543 i know how hard it was for me to deal with five weeks of radiation
7896544 i enjoyed it mostly because of sen kennedys dedication and the speech he delivered
7896545 i was very surprised to see him make it to the convention i thought the democrats did a good job getting their message out
7896546 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7896547 what i saw was an audience that responded to michelle obamas appeal to women
7896548 i thought the speakers all did a tremendous job in terms of acquainting barack obama to the public
7896549 i think people now have more insight into what he is about
7896550 i would say this was the beginning of getting their message out
7896551 this probably tilled the soil now they will go about the business of planting and fertilizing
7896552 he obama is no one to be afraid of he will get things done
7896553 having spoken with obama i believe he is the right man for the job and that he is here at the right time for our country
7896554 i cant wait to see what will happen tonight with hillary i dont know what she will say i hope they the obama and clinton factions have made peace true peace with themselves that is sincere
7896555 michelle was very vulnerable last night very open and sincere
7896556 this is a middle class black family that you really dont see too often she really reminded me of my own family
7896557 its small things you might think were garbage but whether its a ball point pen or a 300 dollar item its property we can link to him
7896558 these people may or may not know these are proceeds from a burglary
7896559 if rod blagojevich really agrees with what this bill is trying to do he ought to sign it not veto it the house and senate have negotiated for months to come up with an ethics bill they can agree on and now hes trying to kill it off by making changes they wont accept but he wont succeed well override his veto
7896560 when the legislature passed this bill they were targeting blagojevich
7896561 it would appear that the governor has perfected pay to play politics in illinois the voters are smart enough to see right through this veto they know what is wrong with state government
7896562 its a word that begins with b and is long and a hard word to pronounce
7896563 gov blagojevich is the only statewide officeholder accepting money from state contractors under his control
7896564 he has become dependent on millions of dollars from state contractors and he is not going to give that up without a fight if taxpayers want fairness in government and want to stop pay to play politics were going to have to fight for an override of this veto
7896565 by vetoing this reform legislation gov blagojevich will be protecting business as usual in state government because blagojevichs campaign committee has targeted state contractors for big contributions too many of them believe they have to pay to play or risk losing their contracts and too many citizens are convinced state contracting is rigged to benefit campaign contributors
7896566 many previous governors including one serving time in a federal prison used similar fundraising practices and gov blagojevich does not want to change
7896567 this has nothing to do with public policy and everything to do with making headlines
7896568 but our numbers are going to go up across the board theyre the traffic unit focusing on all traffic violations in addition to truck enforcement
7896569 just from observation i see a very high compliance rate
7896570 the injuries we used to see involving kids are fewer now

7896572 i do not consider a sale complete until goods are worn out and the customer still satisfied l l bean 1916
7896573 i like a lot of african music where the music is the body is the performance and i just dont feel like i see that at orchestra concerts
7896574 our traffic monitoring network shows the start of a change in driving patterns and behaviour over the past six to 12 months
7896575 average motorway speeds have reduced as has congestion this indicates a reduction in the volume of vehicles especially hgvs travelling on the roads
7896576 one obvious explanation for this is that rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
7896577 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds it really is a case where less haste can mean more speed
7896578 the fall in congestion is good news in an otherwise bleak picture for uk motorists and shows that motorists are moving journeys out of peak hours where possible
7896579 in scholarship on the history of modern and ancient philosophy the interpenetration of scholarly cultures among the anglophone german french and italian philosophical communities is now essentially complete
7896580 t his brute sociological fact about contemporary philosophy about hierarchies of prestige and influence is what makes rankings of philosophy departments and information about job placement so essential to those entering the field
7896581 i only think this because the the contingent events that brought me to study with so and so not because it is actually true
7896582 masochistic metatheory that philosophical issues are the ones that nobody else cares about
7896583 our non conference schedule will be very competitive and extremely beneficial in helping our young team prepare for big 12 competition
7896584 there is a great opportunity for our team to get a taste of life on the road against four quality opponents in hawaii northern iowa iowa and houston dates against pac 10 member oregon state and ncaa qualifier drake will be two outstanding pre conference games in hilton coliseum
7896585 the big 12 conference as always will be one of the nations best
7896586 kansas oklahoma and baylor will likely be three of the best teams in the league and we will get a chance to play them in hilton coliseum
7896587 not ready 08 presser with other gop leaders to counter message the dems in denver colorado
7896588 i certainly think there is a huge amount of risk involved in this now
7896589 were talking a matter of weeks the whole situation has very much swung in the opposite direction
7896590 we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing cooperation between russia and india in the energy sector
7896591 no it was just really great to meet him and people that you usually see on tv like rafael nadal and roger federer to me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7896592 i dont know if it follows them as much as they chase it
7896593 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
7896594 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7896595 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7896596 began a weeklong effort to present her husband and his entire family as embodiments of the american dream
7896597 despite republican attempts to paint her as a liberal elitist she said in her speech that she knows from her familys struggles and successes that the american dream endures
7896598 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7896599 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7896600 consumer spending online is an indicator for consumer preferences attitudes and offline trends in society
7896601 the index results show a significant shift in consumer behavior especially among female consumers we have noticed that as compared to men a higher percentage of women are concerned with fraud identity theft and the economy in fact 38 of women said that they would purchase more online if they could control their finances and pay using cash
7896602 we thought it was most important to bring this critical information to the retail industry and give online retailers a projection of consumer spending for the upcoming quarter and an opportunity to gain critical insight on customer behavior
7896603 we look forward to releasing this data quarterly to provide a snapshot of consumer online shopping activity and track the various trends that will be uncovered
7896604 corporate blogging is so popular because it allows organizations to connect with their raving fans on a deeper level than previously available
7896605 passionate companies now have a platform to publish their news information and opinions independently and create a continued two way dialogue with the world
7896606 as a very large population in the quick service industry is 16 to 22 blogging will become a great way to engage them their ideas concerns and suggestions
7896607 blogging and social networking are an integral part of the dna of the new generation entering the work force
7896608 one that regularly shares fresh perspectives offers the reader a glimpse inside the true culture fabric of the corporation and provides relevant links
7896609 are you trying to create buzz around a new menu item
7896610 you really have to be clear about your purpose before you embark otherwise you wont make the necessary investment of time effort and resources to do it right
7896611 see if your customers are in a demographic that is active in the blogging or internet community
7896612 most quick serve industry interaction is monologue let me tell you what were doing or here is yet another guest satisfaction survey
7896613 why not engage them in a true dialogue and offer a coupon for each valuable response
7896614 you have to ask yourself if opening up the floodgates of conversation about you is something you desire
7896615 the person blogging for your company should embody the brand essence of your business
7896616 they should be professional well written and a people person understanding the blogosphere is a plus but understanding your business and how to communicate it to the world is even more important
7896617 the worst blogs are the dead ones that havent been updated regularly and comments are disabled
7896618 its part of the quirkiness of the league and part of the history we did it in the past and we will deal with it again
7896619 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
7896620 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7896621 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7896622 considering were just five days away and that its the last day in pads we did move up practice to try and beat the weather forecast it rained pretty hard for 10 15 minutes and i guess the guys thought that any minute practice was going to be over and it wasnt i can only hope thats the reason why we lost our edge which is sad to say
7896623 its not his moreno choice to wear the green jersey and he probably wouldnt have worn it as much as we made him wear it but thats not his call
7896624 but hes out of the green now and thats good
7896625 well have a personnel meeting tonight monday or tomorrow first thing whatever fits best for everybody
7896626 i was trying to get it off earlier but they made me keep wearing it just to make sure i was 100 percent
7896627 it was just a tweak but they trainers wanted me to strengthen it up so it wouldnt get worse later in the season
7896628 by not being out there of course i was losing ground but nobody knows what the depth chart is right now
7896629 its been kind of frustrating not knowing exactly whats going on there but it keeps you on your ps and qs
7896630 this fall i probably got more reps with the number one offense so i do feel more comfortable with those guys and i have a good feeling of what theyre going to do before the play and i think they have the same feeling about what im going to do before the play
7896631 any time you can return so many guys and youre out there with the same unit obviously youre going to have a sense of comfort
7896632 youve been out in the huddle with those guys youve seen how they react to big games being together with them a whole year and coming back it definitely adds some comfort
7896633 i feel like my arm has gotten stronger since last year i feel like im able to put a little more zip on the ball and its coming along really well right now
7896634 dejuan is really tall and lanky and athletic and he can get some balls that you throw up there you think ehh maybe but then hell go up there and get it
7896635 jameel is just a really solid football player he runs good routes and hes got great hands and he just has a knack for finding space and making plays i feel very comfortable if those guy are going to be out there throwing them the ball
7896636 sometimes youre supposed to run a slant and i end up staying outside and sam throws it there
7896637 i dont know how to explain it but its kind of like were in each others head you can feel what he feels sometimes and knowing where to go i think that just comes along with being with him every day and throwing with him every day in the summer time
7896638 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7896639 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7896640 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7896641 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7896642 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7896643 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7896644 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7896645 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7896646 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7896647 more recently the term boondoggle has come to refer to a government or corporate project involving large numbers of people and usually heavy expenditure where at some point the key operators have realized that the project is never going to work but are reluctant to bring this to the attention of their superiors
7896648 not exactly the foot that most canadians would want to see put forward
7896649 conservatives are supposed to be pro business this is business its a 5 billion industry and given that that industry particularly in toronto is at deaths door right now youd think that the federal government would be doing everything it could to help

7896690 secretary of state condoleeza rice in jerusalem to help israeli and palestinian leaders make progress in their negotiations said when asked about the report that she had told israeli officials that such building did not advance the cause of peace
7896691 peace now opposes israeli building on land captured in the 1967 war such as the west bank and favors facilitating the creation of a palestinian state there it is nevertheless considered a reliable source of settlement information
7896692 israeli leaders have argued that ultimately a deal with the palestinians will allow it to hold onto several settlement blocs and neighborhoods in east jerusalem in exchange for land swaps therefore they say their building in east jerusalem and close in settlements on their side of the barrier should not be cause for concern over ill will

7896694 we will use the vat proceeds to close the lrt mrt loop seeking foreign loans may take too much time and anyway we have the money to spend
7896695 the president decided to use the vat funds because when we borrow money we would have to pay interest through this project we can see the advantages of the vat this project will be locally funded and is indeed a fruit of vat
7896696 this is superior to xstratas offer of a 1 28 per share

7896699 the three cases which are known as the marshall trilogy are johnson v
7896700 supreme court chief justice marshall stated in the establishment of these relations between europeans and indians the rights of the original inhabitants were in no instance entirely disregarded
7896701 cherokee nation v georgia 1831 ruled that indian tribes were a distinct political society separated from others capable of managing their own affairs and governing themselves getches et al 1979 162
7896702 the indians acknowledged no obedience or allegiance or subordination to any foreign sovereign whatsoever and as far as they have possessed the means they have ever since asserted this plenary right of dominion and yielded it up only when lost by the superior force of conquest or transferred by a voluntary cession in other words the indian nations were free and independent when they made treaties with the united states
7896703 2 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations such territorial jurisdictions and geographic areas being the natural wealth and patrimony represent the social cultural and political identity and pride of all the bangsamoro people ownership of the homeland is vested exclusively in them by virtue of their prior rights of occupation that had inhered in them as sizeable bodies of people delimited by their ancestors since time immemorial and being the first politically organized dominant occupants
7896704 amid all the talk of casinos people keep referring to tribes as sovereign nations but what exactly this means is the subject of constant debate
7896705 while stumping for her tribes controversial casino san pablo development last week lytton band of pomo indians chairwoman margie mejia described sovereign nations this way were little countries living within a big country thats somewhat accurate but doesnt tell the whole story
7896706 at its simplest sovereign means independent and self ruled a completely sovereign nation is an equal to all other sovereign nations in all respects from foreign policy powers to economic self sufficiency to citizenship
7896707 tribes do have executive legislative and judicial governmental power over all their internal affairs including the power to make and enforce laws for their benefit and protection this power is considered inherent meaning it wasnt granted to them by anyone
7896708 tribes maintain unique nation to nation relationships with the us government congress and the federal courts have some power to limit tribal jurisdiction but case law has established that tribes reserve any rights they havent expressly given away

7896720 i would anticipate that there will be serious bidding for the rights to future olympics
7896721 its very difficult to anticipate what the media landscape is going to be in 2014 or 2016 you really need a crystal ball to figure out what the value is
7896722 the more people who are interested in broadcasting the olympics all that does is raise the ante for broadcast rights fees which will then be passed along to advertisers
7896723 you really have to be almost a nostradamus how well will broadband be adopted by then will content be streamed on cellphones how do you sell it how do you project revenue
7896724 some of this is unpredictable you dont know next time if youre going to get a michael phelps youre going to get a china thing but after something like this the value could shoot through the roof

7896799 ceos tell people all the time that they value integrity a good way to walk the walk is have integrity on salaries
7896800 a major concern from a management perspective is that an employee goes from being unhappy to becoming a true villain
7896801 in a worst case scenario an employee may actually try and sabotage others by spreading rumors not sharing important work related information and engage in other problem behaviors
7896802 payscale takes it to the next level its very scientific
7896803 by working together to offer an inside look at companies we can open access and bring greater transparency to information in one of the most important parts of our lives our work
7896804 the best way for employees to handle a perceived inequity in salary is to gather market data on what similar positions make in other organizations and make a thoughtful and rational performance based argument on why they should be closer to or even exceed the salary of their peers

7896822 it was the heart and soul of summerside right from the beginning really
7896823 the overall focus was that it was probably the greatest asset that we had in the downtown core that could contribute to some revitalization
7896824 there were some people that were of the mind that it should be torn down and build a new building and there were others and i think others were the majority who wanted it retained and it brought back to life
7896825 we looked at the reports and felt that the building didnt have any huge surprises
7896826 in that respect it was almost like working with a new building
7896827 weve just tried to retain as much of the heritage characteristics of this building as we possibly could
7896828 aesthetically its quite appealing for people they like the warehouse environment

7896920 this work has led to an important discovery about the source of nitrogen that fuels the productivity of tropical ocean waters especially those into which large rivers flow
7896921 these organisms are regulated by the biogeochemistry of the river and are sensitive to land use alterations and climate change activities such as dam construction and changing agricultural practices will alter the magnitude of this draw down
7896922 the important places are probably not the high latitudes but rather the low latitude areas where nitrogen fixation is a predominant process

7896929 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7896930 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7896931 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7896932 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention

7896937 the decision of russian authorities to recognise the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is causing serious worry
7896938 bulgaria once again re iterates its unconditional support for the independence sovereignty and internationally recognised borders
7896939 this point has been repeatedly made by foreign minister ivailo kalfin and is shared by all nato and eropean union member states which have called on russia to withdraw its troops from georgia immediately and have committed themselves to helping the local population
7896940 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7896941 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7896942 an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7896943 we consider this is a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7896944 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7896945 russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7896946 who say that taking away consumers right to sue would also take away a strong incentive for the fda and the pharmaceutical industry to be open about a drugs potential for causing harm

7896956 they will then crawl under the desk find that they forgot to plug it in or plugged it into the wrong port blow out the dust plug it in and reply um yeah that fixed it thanks
7896957 just to make sure that the software writes out its settings
7896958 if youre a barber and you cut a germans hair does that make you a collaborator
7896959 what kind of collaborator was john mccain the admitted war criminal who will hate his alleged torturers for the rest of his life
7896960 i have witnessed incidents where he has used profanity at colleagues he would disagree about something and then explode
7896961 irrational behavior weve all had incidents where we have gotten angry but ive never seen anyone act like that
7896962 i am a black criminal and i have performed the deeds of an air pirate i almost died and the vietnamese people saved my life thanks to the doctors
7896963 my only contention with the mccain deal is that while he was at the plantation to the best of my knowledge and teds knowledge he was not physically abused in any way no one was in that camp it was the camp that people were released from
7896964 ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
7896965 highly classified information the most important of which was the package routes which were routes used to bomb north vietnam he gave in detail the altitude they were flying the direction if they made a turn he gave them what primary targets the united states was interested in
7896966 called off the bombing of north vietnam because of the information mccain had given to them
7896967 the story reported that mccain collaborated in psywar offensives aimed at american servicemen
7896968 the broadcast was beamed to american servicemen in south vietnam as a part of a propaganda series attempting to counter charges by u s defense secretary melvin laird that american prisoners are being mistreated in north vietnam
7896969 i had dreaded just such a discovery by my father
7896970 i only recently learned that the tape i dreamed i heard playing over the loudspeaker in my cell had been real it had been broadcast outside the prison and had come to the attention of my father
7896971 if i had known at the time my father had heard about my confession i would have been distressed beyond imagination and might not have recovered from the experience as quickly as i did
7896972 lamented in the interview that if i hadnt been shot down i would have become an admiral at a younger age than my father
7896973 barral said mccain boasted that he was the best pilot in the navy and that he wanted to be an astronaut
7896974 he felt superior to the vietnamese up there in his plane with all his training
7896975 nobody believes these idiots theyre a bunch of jerks forget them

7897041 the author ghost writers and publishers of this book have agreed in court that the book contained a very large number 11 serious falsehoods which theyve admitted were complete lies
7897042 and the court has so ruled that these 11 statements were defamatory and untruthful

7897045 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers

7897047 i hope that maybe this device of the declaration of falsity is another way of pursuing these matters
7897048 instead of going for the megabucks you simply go to court for the important thing which is to establish whats true and whats not

7897066 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7897067 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7897068 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7897069 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7897070 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown

7897129 it played very well in all of my living rooms
7897130 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again
7897131 a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7897132 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7897133 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7897134 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7897135 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7897136 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7897137 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7897138 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing

7897149 sharepoint is the most installed piece of software in the whole world thats not being used properly people dont really understand what theyve got
7897150 a lot of users assumed sharepoint was one of those microsoft applications that would help you figure out how to use it
7897151 we proposed a portal for the analytics team at a major client when they learned we were proposing sharepoint they nearly canceled the project sharepoint had simply been pushed out to them in the past had seen some small use and then became a dumping ground the business decision maker considered it an organizational disaster because of the confusion that resulted
7897152 in the early days the user frustration that sometimes resulted from early adopter departments experimenting with sharepoint was really the flip side of the hunger for features and functions that were simply not available out of the box
7897153 at some point and not too far away being adept at interacting with sharepoint workspaces will be as necessary to an individual users skill set as knowing how to use ms office
7897154 sharepoint is going to be the glue that holds so many other things together
7897155 we find that about 50 of our customers have had some experience with sharepoint most of it is very rudimentary they built some basic workspaces but theyre not full featured enough to address the full business need
7897156 a significant number of the calls we get is from companies just waking up to the fact that they need professional help to take things farther
7897157 sharepoint right out of the box is missing some things that a lot of business users really need
7897158 too many users assume that sharepoint is self contained and it isnt the sharepoint they first experience should be thought of as a 1 0 version other parts and services are needed to turn it into a solution
7897159 we used to get calls from it groups who had hit a snag in production and needed help working around a shortcoming or finding a more robust way to bring legacy data into a sharepoint project site
7897160 now the bulk of the calls we get tend to occur higher in the process where plans are being laid some of these result in custom web parts or solution accelerator bundles its a much more disciplined process aiming at bigger goals
7897161 big companies and small ones you never know when the buzz is going to take hold we were at a client the other day who was certain they had one sharepoint workspace because they had just posted a demo site of the sharepoint tools a brief audit uncovered nine sharepoint workspaces and several more being worked on it freaked at the speed at which users were putting up their own sites and how few basic controls there were for managing any of this
7897162 we quickly learned that some of the most valuable webparts we could provide were those that simplified administration and oversight not just for the business users but for the it administrators who were facing a proliferation of sharepoint workspaces
7897163 ill bet money that companies who discover all these rogue sharepoint sites are finding mostly failed experiments
7897164 expectations tend to be all over the place assumptions guiding activity more than understanding resulting in waning activity over time as they keep having to branch out to accomplish some task that sharepoint doesnt yet accommodate
7897165 weve seen some sharepoint sites go the way all user enabled tech goes sometimes which is straight from experiment to production just look at excel sharepoint is more susceptible to this than many other technologies because it has so many more pieces which appear to be so much more accessible imagine what would happen if database tools were just as user inviting and made openly available luckily you have to be pretty technical to set up a database whereas you dont with sharepoint
7897166 this is exactly why we dont recommend that companies start with wss see if it resonates with users then apply the lessons learned to a business case for moss
7897167 the very thing most needed to ensure successful implementation is the very thing missing from such an approach integration into the broader it infrastructure security scalable capacity dedicated support active directory backup even database structure if sharepoint really takes off it is in major reactive mode to gather all this up develop a strategy and assign a budget
7897168 every technology has always stressed the importance of regular dialog between the business user and it but with sharepoint the absence of such a dialog is very obvious it results in sprawl or users doing highly unsound things with sensitive data or elaborate workarounds long after the third party providers have solved the root problem with new web parts
7897169 unless the company has made a real conscious commitment to sharepoint at a strategic level about all the governance we see is occasionally at the user department level
7897170 the life of its own implementations that are really changing the ways departments work invariably comes from those departments whose teams and management have decided what they will use it for and how they will keep it organized but that hardly answers the larger issues of security and conformity to the companys compliance policies the issue is not one of control it is one of mutual empowerment for the creation of high value solutions
7897171 we helped one client put a small server farm in place strictly for sharepoint
7897172 along with a simple request process for user groups to request server space for putting up new workspaces not only did this put some structure around what had been an ad hoc process but it reinforced with every new site that sharepoint done well was a deep collaboration between users and it the process didnt communicate control nearly as much as thoughtful resource allocation and enablement
7897173 sharepoint really grays the lines between it and the business sharepoint is such a colossal tool really a swiss army knife of a platform
7897174 it can accommodate almost anything instead of organizing information on a webpage were now organizing workflow functions on a webpage that once were available only as point solutions organizations trying to fit sharepoint governance into some rigid framework of traditional it management are in for a bumpy ride
7897175 a huge one but it doesnt contain everything every possible use might require additional parts are needed and basic services to get the most out of it in short some resource is required to turn the toolbox into solutions whether that is an internal it group or an outside specialist firm with something as deep and broad as sharepoint solutions dont just happen they are constructed
7897176 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7897197 teamwork in one form or another is something most of us have to engage in everyday on our jobs for the greater good of the company unfortunately when it comes to politics working together and seeking compromise too frequently prove to be stumbling blocks
7897198 too often partisanship drives our political process to the point where winning the next election by any means is more important than being able to govern effectively if elected this turns off voters and makes it very difficult to solve problems and achieve real progress once in office
7897199 while todays bipartisanship letter is the final message in the series in many ways it also marks the start of this effort for us
7897200 we intend to keep these polices top of mind for the candidates and the public right up to the election and into the next legislative session the upcoming gubernatorial debates in merrillville jasper and bloomington will offer the perfect opportunity for the candidates to address these and other policy topics
7897201 while i had tremendous opportunities as a student the students today have even many more
7897202 as a student it seemed like there were many options but now really the options are endless for students who are looking to get into any of our majors
7897203 these days it seems like many students who you meet are doing two or even three majors and a minor on top of it its neat to see that they have those opportunities to combine all of their interests rather than having to choose just one thing that will help prepare them for their career
7897204 its very rare to meet a student who doesnt know where he or she is going after graduation
7897205 all of us who have worked with kathleen know that she brings a high level of energy and creativity to her assignments
7897206 she has led innovative programs to help attract top students to our school including overseeing the direct admission program and coordinating the young womens institute having received her undergraduate degree here will give her a special perspective on the undergraduate experience
7897207 for example there are many more global opportunities such as our taking students to india or our emerging markets trips over spring break
7897208 none of those opportunities were there our students benefit so much from trips like that as well as the classroom learning that accompanies those types of programs
7897209 weve really become a forerunner on the international front and were talking about forming partnerships with other universities beyond the traditional studies abroad programs
7897210 nows the time to go beyond that whether its more of these short term experiences or helping students find an internship abroad and take that area of interest to the next level
7897211 kathleen with her enthusiasm tireless effort and kind disposition will enhance student experiences outside of the classrooms and in the professional development dimension combination of world class staff and her leadership will usher in an era of innovation in student services at the kelley school of business

7897237 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements

7897244 i was hired in december 2000 to take tahoe and office web server into the datacenter and make it hostable in microsoft global production datacenters the operations and engineering work id do would set both the product and the product teams up to provide sharepoint as a service at microsoft we built a very tight relationship between microsoft it and the sharepoint product team that would be envied by other product teams from ops analyst and engineer id become the ops manager over the global collaboration operations team we ran the operations and engineering service for the global sharepoint environments for both wss 2 0 and sps 2003 the largest deployments of their kind in the world as a result of our success and or peers in exchange microsoft decided it needed to take our excellence on the road with a hosted sharepoint service and microsoft managed solutions was born my designs with the help of mike watson would grow into a dedicated sharepoint hosting platform for enterprises the first deployment of which was energizer a customer i was able to see planned architected and deployed from end to end in our 1 0 offering after years of sharing my experience at various around the globe and a successful blog i really got a bug for taking my experiences and lessons to a broader audience through technical evangelism with the sharepoint technical product management team it was here i would fight even more for the it experience both in the box and post launch with information on the web through various channels and sites through whitepapers technet content webcasts dvds and ar pr discussions and reviews
7897245 i continue to be a multi faceted sharepoint geek speaker writer blogger consultant teacher designer and evangelist i continue to spread the sharepoint message and help out those whom i can help the most my blog at http www sharepointjoel com is my conduit and successful sharepoint deployment and adoption for it is my message im doing technical evanglism and product management for nintex teaching for the ted pattison group dont miss sharepoint admin survival summer camp and working on some secret tools to make the sharepoint admins life easier if you plan to go to tech ed you could see me presenting at 5 techeds around the globe this year
7897246 the sharepoint team definitely follows what it preaches development lifecycle is truly what happens the project managers are really responsible for working with the product planners product planning begins way before the previous version ships in fact you can find people talking about the next 2 3 versions as they plan what will be in the next version a variety of roles and responsibilities make up the team the main core engineering team is made up of pms devs and testers as well youll find support release managers product planners product managers make up the broader team to support it through its life cycle after rtm and often even before many of the project managers are already working on the next version of the product and teams shift focus to supportability and scope is locked the thing that might surprise most people is the adds cuts meetings customers often think why didnt they do this or that obvious feature believe me that feature was likely discussed over and over and someone fought for it and unfortunately the scope had to be locked in order to meet the goals to ship
7897247 i believe the real features that hook the end users and easy to adopt are the collaboration features the simplicity and scalability of the base platform and site provisioning are the most powerful
7897248 this could get me in trouble if not explained well

7897262 the current government aims to revive the culture of the early years of the revolution and make the culture of the koran and mosques a priority
7897263 i just feel that robotic nurses and robotic doctors are completely contrary to what medicine is about
7897264 i hate the idea of the surgeon being removed from the patients
7897265 our engineers have been working on it overnight but in order to carry out a full repair and find out where the problem is coming from they have to open up the road
7897266 most experts agree that the government will need to replace at least a half million federal employees in the near future
7897267 the upcoming wave of expected retirements may be a tsunami as some predict or it may have the erosive effect of a constant crashing of smaller waves upon the beach
7897268 despite the nations grim job forecast the federal government is on a hiring spree
7897269 according to the organizations research uncle sam needs to fill 193 000 mission critical jobs by september 2009 there are federal jobs available in practically every interest and skill area in all 50 states and around the world
7897270 how can i do what you do but on a bigger scale and not worry about potholes
7897271 as recently as three years ago people thought we had a natural gas shortage in this country and that we were perilously close to being in a situation where we were going to have to import
7897272 now were trying to figure out what to do with all this
7897273 the auto companies also did a lousy job marketing them
7897274 they thought these things were going to sell themselves federal fleets state fleets municipal fleets are going to have to buy them
7897275 nokia sailed through first half of the year with little changes in its phone portfolio now the portfolio renewal has started and this should boost profitability
7897276 all manufacturers are trying to sustain or extend their high tier device portfolios because of the higher margins they offer
7897277 furthermore in saturated markets in western europe and north america replacement sales depend on offering consumers something compelling over and above voice and text
7897278 in terms of the cost of the conflict the impact on the economy is negligible
7897279 were not expecting to take a negative action with regards to russias rating the main potential impact on russia is through an impact on capital flows into the country affecting foreign investment
7897280 given that russia has 580 billion in foreign exchange reserves it has the ability to ride out weekly changes
7897281 there are a significant number of corporates who are very dependent on international capital markets
7897282 there could be an impact on the russian banking system as well
7897283 we dont see any immediate impact its more a potential impact if russia decides to take more aggressive action in due course
7897284 that the russian government leadership now has chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
7897285 the decision represents a russian choice of path that will have sweeping consequences for a long time to come
7897286 the decision represents a breach of international law and basic principles of stability in europe which is as obvious as it is intentional
7897287 the balkanization of the caucasus on an ethnic basis is a serious danger for everyone
7897288 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7897289 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in united nations security council resolutions
7897290 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7897291 there will scarcely be a neighbor of russias that wont judge this negatively
7897292 russia will face accusations of breaching international law by europe and much of the rest of the world hardly any other state will follow this recognition russia will stand relatively alone with this step in contrast to the recognition of kosovo
7897293 europe is standing relatively helplessly as regards an effective response to this russian statement
7897294 russia knows that there are very different views among europeans about sanctions and that they have limited capacity to impose sanctions economic sanctions boomerang back on those who impose them and diplomatically you cant break off all diplomatic contact if you still hope to exert some influence on russia
7897295 we could expect it because the regions were de facto independent and especially in the last two three years russia has invested large money into both republics especially after the conflict in south ossetia it was just a question of time before they would recognize them officially
7897296 the russians are saying there is a kosovo precedent but this situation is completely different in each of the republics
7897297 i dont think there could be a return to fighting because basically they achieved all their goals except maybe the removal of georgian president mikheil saakashvili on the other hand his position is now quite weak
7897298 its likely capital outflow will continue and probably even intensify on the back of a possible escalation of the conflict and possible economic sanctions against russia
7897299 capital outflow is likely to add to the weakening of the rouble which we have been witnessing recently
7897300 the whirlwind crescendo of bad news seems never ending but the lower this market goes the more attractive it becomes for fundamental based investors who have a longer term horizon
7897301 were in a very very thin market right now the second half of august is the peak of the vacation season its almost dysfunctional right now
7897302 this is one of the worst corrections weve seen in a decade its bigger than the one in 2004 bigger than the one in 2006
7897303 across the board the valuations speak for themselves but and its a big but no one wants to be the first to stick their foot back into the market
7897304 its self fulfilling the fewer people buy the worse the prices get what you need is an indisputable catalyst for the domestic market at this point the only thing we can think of is some kind of announcement on the oil tax regime that would be indisputably linked to the major part of the market have an immediate bottom line impact and draw some people in
7897305 if you look at the rtsi futures they dropped about 25 points on the news russia had recognized abkhazia and south ossetia i think what investors have been hoping in the last couple of weeks is for the government to take active steps to minimize the conflict and the recognition of these two entities is clearly a step in the wrong direction from the stock markets point of view
7897306 this is a symptom of the poor sentiment toward russia on the international public level on the domestic political level and oil prices are at a new low in recent days and weeks it is very hard to see any positives for the russian market at the current time
7897307 however every single stock on micex at this point is in the red and well in the red you are seeing a host of technical indicators that are telling you this market is grossly oversold it is hard for me to see how the news gets worse unless oil dips below 105
7897308 because criminals are becoming more sophisticated and rendering traditional security obsolete we focused on digging more deeply and broadly to stop attacks that by pass other security products
7897309 were making javascript disappear as far as performance is concerned
7897310 one example is to use the browser as a very simple photoshop
7897311 editing an image requires things that for each step takes the better part of a second thats not a great user experience but with tracemonkey now you have something that comes close to interactive performance
7897312 we are planning for it to be there in firefox 3 1
7897313 it wont have all the capabilities theres more than a couple of months of work left but we are targeting 3 1
7897314 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7897315 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs
7897316 theres no theoretical reason why it cant be as sharp and approach native code speeds in two to four years
7897317 all browsers have improved their javascript speed we focused on our tests
7897318 an end to end virtualisation solution that spans servers applications and desktops
7897319 when its streamed down to me i dont have to worry about installing it or anything i always have the latest greatest version of it
7897320 not only does it start up quickly but should anything go wrong with the application i can just re stream it
7897321 rather than run it on your own desktop youre running it on a server virtualizing the presentation layer and distributing it over the network
7897322 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7897323 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7897324 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7897325 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7897326 they are clearly trying to empty southern ossetia from georgians which i dont think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations
7897327 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year declines in the present situation index both in terms of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating
7897328 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7897329 the most overbuilt areas of the country including california nevada arizona and florida contrast greatly with most other states where prices are declining more moderately or even increasing
7897330 this blog is also not intended for the catty women of a certain message board here on a witch hunt
7897331 oh how dare you do this to your daughter you are horrible parents she will be damaged forever by this
7897332 tackling child poverty must be a top priority for the government and while i recognise the difficulties in targeting those most in need this does not mean that everything must come to a standstill
7897333 as an intermediary measure i would suggest that the government introduce a school meals programme and a system to deliver free school books to all children this would help to alleviate the pressures faced by many parents who are struggling to meet the rising costs of educating their children
7897334 if the government is genuinely serious about tackling child poverty then it must re look at its current childcare policy with a view to reversing the current trend which has seen many community based childcare providers close down
7897335 the new government policy has led to a situation where those on low and middle incomes are pulling their children out of childcare facilities as they cannot afford the payments without government assistance
7897336 i am georgiana i am not diana the film is not about diana
7897337 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7897338 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7897339 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash
7897340 do not do something to people you would not want them to do to you
7897341 and i cant stand situations where someone does something wrong complaining whining being mean being annoying and yet blows a gasket when somebody else put them into the same situation you have to
7897342 absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate
7897343 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards meters
7897344 some methed up yahoos high on drugs talking out of their heads
7897345 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
7897346 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
7897347 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7897348 ciao guarda che questo weekend vado da sola in montagna con tizio
7897349 abbiamo saputo reagire dopo un primo tempo in cui abbiamo sbagliato troppo mentre nella ripresa invece abbiamo fatto di piu rispetto a loro siamo stati anche bravi a riprendere la partita in mano e abbiamo avuto pure loccasione di chiuderla alla fine del supplementare e ai rigori chiaro che se guardiamo al risultato finale ne usciamo male ma il mio giudizio non si puo limitare a un rigore fuori o dentro
7897350 secondo me bisogna concentrare gli sforzi su quello che e possibile e comunque non e un giocatore in piu o in meno che fa la differenza ma come ci si allena e io non dimentico di avere gia degli ottimi giocatori
7897351 ho notato che nessuno ha messo in evidenza il fatto che mourinho abbia sostitutio mancini mentre qui ogni volta ci si andava a chiedere il perche io lavessi sostituito e non ci limitava al giudizio che lui aveva espresso in campo
7897352 ha evidenziato di avere ancora qualche problema ma io non mi aspettavo niente di piu da lui perche poverino e ancora passato troppo poco tempo dallinfortunio
7897353 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from vaginal delivery when compared with clinicians
7897354 this indicates that experiencing labor and attempting a normal birth are two very important priorities in womens decision making
7897355 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong
7897356 if theyve seen a traumatic birth or been involved in a tragedy there is no debriefing for them
7897357 it can mean they are more judgemental about the risks involved
7897358 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
7897359 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
7897360 the surge has succeeded in reducing violence dramatically for the moment
7897361 the sunni awakening councils also known as sons of iraq who turned the war around when they abandoned the insurgency and agreed to be funded by the u s
7897362 it can be best described as a terrible shameful waste of lives and resources
7897363 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal side michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
7897364 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
7897365 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7897366 if moms not happy nobody is happy if dads not happy who cares
7897367 the last time us refineries exported as much gasoline outside our borders was wwii when we were helping to refuel allied nations devastated by the war
7897368 the quality is the same the gas they bring it from el paso its the same i havent seen any difference in the function of the car
7897369 i guess a real critic would say thats not very patriotic
7897370 i dont know if its premature to come down and order recycling bins but the ordinances second reading will be in september and well be good to go
7897371 fixing the rate of taxation for the year 2008 on all tangible property subject to tax trust and insurance companies public service companies and levying said tax for city purposes
7897372 unless saudi islamofascists have rammed a few jumbo jets into new york city skyscrapers or the pentagon dont bother me
7897373 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units
7897374 they do the food history so they would make the linkages
7897375 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7897376 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7897377 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7897378 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things
7897379 ceos tell people all the time that they value integrity a good way to walk the walk is have integrity on salaries
7897380 a major concern from a management perspective is that an employee goes from being unhappy to becoming a true villain
7897381 in a worst case scenario an employee may actually try and sabotage others by spreading rumors not sharing important work related information and engage in other problem behaviors
7897382 payscale takes it to the next level its very scientific
7897383 by working together to offer an inside look at companies we can open access and bring greater transparency to information in one of the most important parts of our lives our work
7897384 the best way for employees to handle a perceived inequity in salary is to gather market data on what similar positions make in other organizations and make a thoughtful and rational performance based argument on why they should be closer to or even exceed the salary of their peers

7897410 im prepared to fight to get more money for the public transit that the city is now looking at
7897411 it s really hard at this point because of the strong currents this has turned into a recovery mission at this point and the search is not going to be aggressively going on

7897413 we dont know at this point whether theres a common thread or not but its something that we are looking into
7897414 a collage of footage from various hollywood movies from mid 90s and on where internet is portrayed what is shown is obviously not the real internet but rather a meta internet fabricated to work in favor of a certain plot or narrative the imagery isnt necessarily very authentic yet we have no difficulty interpreting this imaginary aesthetic
7897415 the spike in oil prices means oil companies are receiving unearned windfall profits that are damaging society not least because the prices rises are fuelling inflation
7897416 of course there are costs involved in the extractive infrastructure but oil companies can operate profitably at price levels way way below where we are at the moment
7897417 it is unarguable i believe that we need this on a recurring basis
7897418 to be effective a windfall tax has to create the expectation that it is not going to be repeated
7897419 first we made a kind of platform of branches for the trunk pieces then we got up there and took down the tree from the top by sections the pieces fell you know with a thud but the platform keeps the pathways from getting cracked or the grass to get a hole in
7897420 one of the ladies who you know had protested about the trees she came over and said you all were right
7897421 to take down only those three but weve done some serious pruning on at least 20 other trees right down the center of the park from end to end

7897461 it can present serious difficulties for the decennial census program
7897462 our cyclical budget needs to serially increase in the years leading up to the decennial censuses and difficulties most often come up in years ending in nine and zero
7897463 a continuing resolution that freezes our budget would make it very difficult for the census bureau
7897464 were under a presidential mandate to get those agents hired
7897465 and were confident we can get it done in 2007 we operated under a continuing resolution for a while and we still managed to hire at a high rate

7897526 the announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region
7897527 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7897528 the announcement by president medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
7897529 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements
7897530 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories

7897763 the council presidency sincerely today tuesday to reward informers law based on what was adopted by parliament in accordance with the provisions of article 61 i of the constitution and before the legal limit constitutionally enshrined article 138 v f
7897764 to encourage those who make news or information leading to the recovery of assets and funds owned by the state and the public sector and the arrest of the perpetrator and take legal action against him as well as the promotion of information on cases make financial and administrative corruption

7897768 the iraqi state enjoys full sovereignty under un resolution no 1456 which was issued in 2004 and has a legal right to establish bilateral agreements with any country
7897769 the iraqi government seeks to avoid points that may be against the interests of iraq in the security agreement including with respect to the immunity of foreign troops in the event the commission of any crimes or accused of committing violations against iraqis and accountability to eliminate iraq
7897770 but this point is still in dispute between the iraqi and american sides and still demands the u
7897771 iraq will benefit from this convention is not just the security aspect but in the area of economic cooperation and other issues
7897772 the iraqi state from the perspective of international law are not willing to sign a security agreement of this size with the united states with evidence that public international law and in accordance with the geneva convention and the signing of agreements that the state must not be free from any kind of will
7897773 the iraqi government has the right to conduct negotiations on an international convention but right ratification is the prerogative of the house and not from the iraqi government the right to sign any reason
7897774 is difficult to predict about the future of this convention because there is considerable pressure for not concluded and if they have been signed this convention and i doubt it it must be passed through several stages of the first stage is the stage of signing and ratifying a second is the prerogative house of representatives and the third stage is the stage of ratification by the president and the fourth phase is the deployment phase
7897775 end this moment there is no justification for signing such an agreement iraqs survival under chapter vii may have mercy of this convention if they passed through force coercion and lack of balance between the american and iraqi side
7897776 the convention was not only the law and approval requires approval by a majority of deputies present in parliament and a majority of those present realized when the quorum of parliament meaning that a quorum is achieved more than fifty percent of the number of members of the house
7897777 the convention are legally treated as any other law under the iraqi constitution and the presidential approval or veto the convention
7897778 take into account the provisions of cassation approved by the council presidency and issued its decisions by simple majority and if revoked the presidential council convention and was returned to parliament it must be the approval of 60 of the number of members of the house of any of at least 165 members of parliament are a large majority

7897781 there is no commitment to introduce the convention on the referendum except the three cases mentioned but that does not prevent the house of parliament to introduce a law on referendum and then must be approved by more than 50 of the number of people voting iraq

7897797 i actually didnt prepare for this operation anyway because i was just assuming it was going to be cancelled
7897798 it is so disappointing because life would be so much easier if this was done and we could live a normal life even go away from home and not worry about having to be close to hospital
7897799 that may include a further advertising campaign to try to attract nurses who have the qualifications back into the system
7897800 we may need to look at what we can do overseas
7897801 we may need also to provide more scholarships but that wont provide a short term response
7897802 no child should have to endure such cancellations no family should have to go through anything like this
7897803 for too long theres been a stalemate between the states and the federal government and thats hurt our health system
7897804 thats why the first thing we need to do is end the blame game and were doing exactly that
7897805 the theatre has been sitting idle for several hours after surgery was again cancelled today
7897806 im honoured to be connected to sir donald bradman in some way even if it did land me in trouble at school 60 years ago
7897807 there were two pictures taken one on the saturday which was featured on front of the herald that night and the other on the tuesday which also made the front page
7897808 when i eventually got back to school the sports teacher said beer i hope you havent got a note to say you are ill
7897809 i said no sir i was at the cricket he said youre lucky the headmaster doesnt read the herald
7897810 we were all hoping mccool would drop it so the don could get a ton
7897811 the story goes that mccool had it well covered but because of the occasion fumbled the catch before kicking it away so bradman could run three
7897812 i had arrived at the ground around 7am waiting for the gates to open before charging to a spot on the fence where i knew bradman would be coming out
7897813 eight hours later he emerged and around 5 30pm got his 100
7897814 it was worth the wait he remains the greatest sportsperson ive seen
7897815 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature

7897819 you dont like to think about what could happen but you cant stop your mind from going there
7897820 when the phone rings between five in the afternoon and 5 15 i know without picking it up its the hospital telling us not to bother coming in the next morning
7897821 im not blaming the hospital id never do that because the nurses and the doctors theyre wonderful and just as frustrated as we are
7897822 but someone has to do something take responsibility i mean for getting this situation fixed
7897823 we have to live here even though the rent is pretty steep because its just 10 minutes to the hospital
7897824 the best doctors and the best nurses weve got those
7897825 what we also have are the worst governments in the world for letting this situation drag on and on
7897826 differences in educational achievement to age 25 may be explained by gender related differences in classroom behaviour with higher rates of disruptive and anti social classroom behaviour in males leading to poorer educational outcomes
7897827 part of the behaviour can be tied to the program boys can be more active
7897828 boys can also have a shorter attention span and some are more outspoken and openly challenge the authority of the teacher
7897829 was not the exclusive province of boys but proportionally more boys are disruptive or disengaged
7897830 i believe in the right to protest but i acted against my own principles
7897831 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature

7897853 the downtown building is too big for the present and future operations
7897854 in 2001 when a petition was submitted the ministry came back and said they wouldnt install the left turn lane because it would cost too much there was no mention of safety issues then
7897855 that is why we are suspicious of their reasoning now
7897856 this had been looked at a number of times before first in 1971 then in 1976 1987 2001 and 2004
7897857 with the latest request the ministry agreed to have an independent firm do a whole new study they were probably aware of the past studies but these are experts in traffic operations eba engineering consultants and they did their own new study and they concluded it would bring about a huge increase in crashes and they would be very severe crashes the ministry clearly feels at this point that we have all these studies to give us all the information we need to clearly determine that we will not be installing a left turn lane there for those safety reasons
7897858 when they build that centre median the ministry has effectively offloaded all that traffic trying to get into the residential areas and those businesses and sent them into the city owned side streets
7897859 police advised him he was under arrest and the male attempted to flee from police the male suspect was apprehended and a physical confrontation occurred
7897860 as the arrest was being made a 48 year old female exited the home with a high powered rifle and attempted to stop the arrest
7897861 the female did not respond to police commands and locked her truck doors
7897862 this required police to approach the vehicle and physically remove her from it
7897863 this may mean that we will see new cases of this outbreak strain appear over the next few weeks
7897864 thinking about sovereign wealth funds as institutional investors exposes a striking tax policy discrepancy on the one hand sovereign wealth funds expect to be treated like private financial investors for purposes of corporate law banking law and national security law they promise to invest for purely financial purposes on the other hand for tax purposes we unilaterally treat them as sovereigns acting to further political diplomatic or humanitarian agendas and we therefore exempt them from taxation as if it were a matter of international comity it is hardly obvious that we should allow sovereign wealth funds to enjoy the best of both regulatory worlds as sovereign wealth funds become powerful players in the capital markets the more logical presumption is that they should pay tax like other financial institutions there is no compelling reason to favor state controlled investment over private capitalism
7897865 theres going to be an independent were dedicated to that
7897866 in our statement we recorded our fundamental position that the unilateral declaration of independence by contradicts resolution 1244 russia india and china encourage belgrade and to resume talks within the framework of international law and hope they reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory

7897879 a dog that races only does it once every five to seven days
7897880 non so se in questo momento si possa parlare di fondamentalismo anticlericale o anticattolico in europa ma certo che questi fenomeni riguardanti la presenza della comunit cristiana nella societ civile si sono verificati qua e l anche in italia
7897881 il tentativo di chiudere la chiesa nelle sagrestie o nel privato ramificato subdolo e incessante assistiamo a un costante sistematico e ottuso rifiuto da parte della cultura laicista oggi dominante di aprire con i cristiani un dialogo autentico i laicisti hanno messo a punto uno strumento teoreticamente rudimentale ma obiettivamente efficace bollano come cattolici senza analizzarne le argomentazioni tutti coloro che non condividono le loro pretese libertarie e li esortano a difendere i loro valori esclusivamente allinterno delle loro comunit confessionali

7897909 i am honored to follow in the footsteps of joos horsten a serial entrepreneur who was a key figure in the development of the western pharmaceutical industry in china
7897910 as a result of joos leadership and foresight rhei pharmaceuticals is uniquely positioned to accelerate the availability of already approved western medicines in the chinese market and i am fortunate to be working with the world class team that joos had assembled in order to pursue its growth strategy
7897911 with one potential launch this year followed by three in 2009 including asacard r and an additional product launch planned each year thereafter until 2012 rhei pharmaceuticals is expected to achieve very rapid growth it is our goal to become the partner of choice for western companies that want to tap into the fast growing chinese health care market as well as for those chinese companies that are interested in distributing western drugs domestically

7897923 imagine if hunter was blackmailing edwards for money or for more money since she was already being paid a monthly stipend and if she were pressuring him by leaking information to the national enquirer and if she tipped off the enquirer to the july meeting including such details as the number of rooms rented and who was in them
7897924 this is a picture of john edwards and rielle hunter together it may be the only photograph it was taken at a dallas book signing in 2006

7897927 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
7897928 we clearly have a long way to go what is lacking is that businesses are failing to investigate the wider opportunities that legislation presents its not all doom and gloom companies can work smarter but only if they know what they are dealing with and what to look for

7897958 at the moment he does not get the games here and so now he can play somewhere and remains in a top level club we have johan djourou we have kolo toure we have senderos we have alex song william gallas and mikael silvestre now who can play centre back so we have a congestion there we want him to play without losing him
7897959 we have been chasing him for a while but obviously the finances involved along with a couple of other things did not make it possible until now
7897960 he is a player i have full admiration for i remember him at aberdeen where he was held in such high esteem that sunderland eventually paid 1million for his services
7897961 unfortunately he had no sooner signed than he picked up an injury and obviously he ended up finding it hard to get back into roy keanes side
7897962 the partisan divide the mccain and obama plans for u s health care reform
7897963 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
7897964 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
7897965 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
7897966 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
7897967 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
7897968 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
7897969 the stock democratic health reform solution before bill clinton changed it was a play or pay employer mandate and thats exactly what barack obama has
7897970 and in 1992 the favorite gop solution was tax credits to buy private health insurance so a lot of things have happened in 16 years the health care system is much worse than it was but we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had

7897974 as a couple with two young children we were becoming increasingly concerned about our impact on the environment and we started to look actively at how we could reduce our own carbon footprint like many families up and down the country we realised there are no easy answers and you cant suddenly become green overnight the philosophy we adopted was to think big and act small both my wife and i work in an office environment and we noticed that we are always using search engines and thats where the idea for click4carbon came from
7897975 the principle behind click4carbon is to offer users one simple means of reducing their footprint through an everyday activity that they already do we are not trying to reinvent the wheel google is by far the most popular search engine in the world all that we want to do is provide users with that same experience but with a different goal in mind click4carbon is our way of trying to make a difference

7897997 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7897998 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7897999 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7898000 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7898132 the index results show a significant shift in consumer behavior especially among female consumers

7898185 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7898186 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified

7898195 the spike in oil prices means oil companies are receiving unearned windfall profits that are damaging society not least because the prices rises are fuelling inflation
7898196 of course there are costs involved in the extractive infrastructure but oil companies can operate profitably at price levels way way below where we are at the moment

7898209 infosys proposed take over of axon group may be a tad expensive and not exactly be a value buy but it is a better investment than making cash sit idle in your balance sheet this should essentially take the pressure off the management and give them the elbow room to now look at better fitting plays something that they had been avoiding so far
7898210 infosys values axon at nearly 2 times cy07 revenues and about 20 times cy07 earnings which is fair in our view axons revenues and pat have grown by 43 and 68 cagr respectively over the past 5 years albeit partly due to acquisitions

7898236 that is why top graduate schools study intuit and you should too
7898237 how the makers of quicken beat microsoft and revolutionized an entire industry inside intuit is a tale of missionaries not mercenaries
7898238 revolutionize how people manage their financial lives many companies say their most important job is satisfying the customer we dont we believe that satisfying the customer is simply the minimum requirement for staying in business therefore we dont seek merely to satisfy our customers we seek to wow them integrity without compromise never approaching what could be considered questionable behavior do right by all our customers treat each other our business partners and our shareholders with the same care and respect with which we treat our customers customers define quality intuit has triumphed in part because we actively solicit input and invent new ways to solicit that input from our customers
7898239 afterward what about results things like market share growing our revenue profits we barely mention them in our values dont we care about results we do market share is a measure of how well we are serving customers do we have to sacrifice our operating values to meet financial goals by no means simply put living and working by our operating values will create customer wow and shareholder value

7898383 anytime you can get rid of something like the cowardly cone of uncertainty thats a good thing and a cause voters can really get behind
7898384 its a hard pill to swallow because right now were never wrong even when we say theres going to be a foot of snow theres always that safety net where we can talk about a 30 percent chance of nothing at all

7898387 i think romney is a fine man and hes always been decent to me but i have a very serious concern and i think the people of massachusetts had about his engagement in the job of governor of massachusetts he spent what was it almost 300 days of the last year of his office out of state and it was indicative of how little attention he was paying to us and weve got some serious challenges

7898411 with millions of americans currently smoking menthol cigarettes the question needs to be answered quickly
7898412 some scientists who think it may enhance the harm caused by other toxic ingredients in tobacco smoke or may encourage smokers to inhale more deeply increasing their exposure to carcinogens
7898413 simply the latest example of a sophisticated campaign by paternalistic moralists to take away a smokers choice to smoke menthol cigarettes or to smoke at all without regard for the facts or for sound science

7898432 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of united nations security council resolutions to which it is party
7898433 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
7898434 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity

7898461 in the beginning we had three buses doing the whole city and that included one day a week to the hart highway area we had no radios in the buses until a year after b c transit took the service over
7898462 we had no heat in the buses and operated with manual steering when it was cold you couldnt turn them
7898463 our hours of service are being increased by 2 400 per year
7898464 i know how important bus service is to many people in prince george and more frequent and expanded services help to make their lives much easier
7898465 what i used in this film is my own emotions
7898466 i went back to experiences i enjoyed as a child and they were what i used as reflections the first scene in the movie where the girl encounters the fox happened exactly like that
7898467 most of us live in cities now far from nature i wanted us to move closer to remake the link between nature and humans
7898468 it was a film i really wanted to do now because im the father of two little girls and i think its time to talk about the environment and also to say its good to be able to marvel at nature
7898469 i am trained as a biologist to walk in nature to enjoy it appreciate it without destroying it
7898470 i wanted to have real quality in the technical aspects so as to capture the beauty of the surroundings and i needed a different crew for the wildlife so it would be truthful to that aspect of nature to really capture nature as it is
7898471 it was even harder than that we had animals children and natural lighting
7898472 and we also had to direct animals so that was very hard we wanted them as close to how the animal would behave in their natural environment as possible it was a really intense shoot but we had moments we couldnt have dreamed of
7898473 we never knew what to expect and we could never say what we were going to do everything was unpredictable
7898474 foxes are difficult to train on some days the foxes looked happy like they were in a good mood and ready to work and on other days they were sulking so we knew it would be impossible because if the fox didnt want to do anything we would have to wait for the next day
7898475 still the fox can be tamed very well and the relationship you make with him can be very moving
7898476 we were lucky to find titus a 12 year old fox who is very comfortable with contact from children so bertille worked most of the time with titus and created a relationship and that relationship was very strong bertille was very happy she would visit the fox in the morning and now she still goes back to see the fox and the fox is always happy to see her too
7898477 it has a bad reputation in france however at the same time it is also a strong figure and image in literature legends and tales it is the companion of men but for some reason wehave a love hate relationship with it
7898478 sadly we heard that two bears had been poisoned in the mountains recently
7898479 formerly man lived there in harmony with nature and as a human being i think thats a disaster because that was one of the last sanctuaries where man and animal coexisted i think the film would not have interested anybody if i made it 50 years ago because then people were still surrounded by nature still peasants but now 80 per cent of the population lives in cities and i think itsreally important to remind us that nature is there
7898480 you hear the childs name only once when her father calls her i didnt want to give her a name she is just a child a symbol of the relationship between animal and man and yes it is the girl meeting the fox but it is also about the fox encountering the girl its about what each of them think of each other i wanted to show nature as something that is close to us and accessible to children
7898481 i think there is a consciousness of ecology that is developing little by little im just afraid that the decisions that we need now will take too much time and will be too late
7898482 oh yeah this is just right i want to live here
7898483 the songs are prepared and ready to be recorded i am only expecting that the money be available to start the work fans may wait for soon they will have a surprise from me i willdo my best to satisfy all those that like the angolan music

7898485 bob barrs presidential campaign has recently learned of an action by the mccain campaign and the pennsylvania republican party to have barr removed from the states ballot this despite mccains promise in the 2000 election that he would
7898486 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
7898487 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
7898488 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
7898489 this is america where people have a right to run for office and a right to compete for the chance to lead the people of this nation
7898490 i look forward to the chance to compete fairly against senator mccain for votes in pennsylvania and every other state
7898491 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take

7898544 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7898545 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7898546 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7898547 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7898548 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7898549 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7898550 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7898551 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7898552 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7898553 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7898554 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

7898557 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7898558 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7898559 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7898560 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7898561 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

7898563 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7898564 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7898565 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

7898567 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7898568 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7898569 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something

7898586 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7898587 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7898588 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7898589 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7898590 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7898591 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7898592 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7898593 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

7898596 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7898597 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7898598 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7898599 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7898600 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

7898603 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7898604 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7898605 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

7898607 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7898608 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

7898641 i was beginning to figure that he had a low spell so i went up to the policeman
7898642 i thought they were going to tell me that his blood sugar had gotten too low and that he was in the hospital

7898652 im hoping that im burn proof with having all those flame retardants in me but the truth is its amazing that those things still are out there
7898653 when you look at the studies that have been done they all point out this is a risky business to mess with
7898654 thirty years ago when a firefighter went into a house the stuff that was burning was just ordinary wood
7898655 all those chemicals add to that exposure that we have
7898656 we wear air packs but it goes through your skin

7898678 as we age what happens is that our sleep gets more fragmented
7898679 the partisan divide the mccain and obama plans for u s health care reform
7898680 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
7898681 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
7898682 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
7898683 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
7898684 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
7898685 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
7898686 the stock democratic health reform solution before bill clinton changed it was a play or pay employer mandate and thats exactly what barack obama has
7898687 and in 1992 the favorite gop solution was tax credits to buy private health insurance so a lot of things have happened in 16 years the health care system is much worse than it was but we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had

7898901 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7898902 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of these times

7898914 also tax is included in the price you pay at the market whereas at safeway youre taxed on your entire purchase
7898915 the quality of the products at the farmers market is really high which is nicer than a lot of other farmers markets

7898927 she didnt want to look too blinged up she didnt want to be too bright i thought she was very simple very understated which might be a good idea because in this era of attack ads the mccain people are saying hey the obamas are elitist theyre caught up in celebrity if she came out in a real fancy dress that would just be more fodder for them

7899075 of their goods take alms so that thou mightiest purify and sanctify them
7899076 trade with the money of the orphan lest it is eaten up by zakaat
7899077 whoever is entrusted with money of an orphan should trade with it and should not leave it sitting to be used up by charity
7899078 what should be considered is the existence of nisaab at the beginning and the end of the zakaat year set by the payer
7899079 but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered
7899080 he who acquires property is not liable for zakaat on it till a year passes
7899081 and in their wealth and possessions was remembered the right of the needy he who asks and he who for some reason was prevented from asking
7899082 so establish regular prayer and give regular alms and obey the messenger that you may receive mercy
7899083 establish regular prayer and give regular alms and loan to allah a beautiful loan
7899084 and they have been commanded no more than this to worship allah offering him sincere devotion being true in faith to establish regular prayer and to practice regular charity and that is the religion right and straight

7899086 o you who believe give of the good things which you have honorably earned and of the fruits of the earth which we have produced for you
7899087 but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered
7899088 and there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah announce unto them a most grievous penalty on the day when heat will be produced out of that wealth in the fire of hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs this is the treasure which you buried for yourselves taste you then the treasures you buried
7899089 for the owner or possessor of gold and silver who does not fulfill its obligation on the day of resurrection it will be cast into sheets of fire and be branded on his forehead side and back whenever it cools it is to be repeated for him in a day whose length is the length of fifty thousand years until the judgement is rendered among the people
7899090 no possessor of a treasure who does not give its zakaat
7899091 would it please you that allah will encircle you with two bracelets of fire
7899092 the messenger entered into my house and saw in my hand a huge ring made of silver so he asked what is this
7899093 no zakaat on you is due until it reaches 20 dinaar
7899094 alms are for the poor and the needy and those employed to administer the funds for those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to truth for those in bondage and in debt in the cause of allah and for the wayfarer thus is it ordained by allah and allah is full of knowledge and wisdom
7899095 a man keeps on asking others for something till he comes on the day of resurrection without any piece of flesh on his face
7899096 whoever asks people for their money so as to get rich he is asking for flames of fire it is up to him to ask for more or less he should beware
7899097 this money is green and sweet he who receives it from people with a cheerful heart allah will bless him in it he who receives it with an avaricious mind would not be blessed in it he will be like the person who eats without being satisfied and the upper hand is better than the lower hand
7899098 if you want i will give you but you should know that the wealthy or an able person who can work has no share in zakaat
7899099 a trustworthy muslim executor is the one who executes completely what has been entrusted to him of zakaat money in good faith
7899100 wait until we receive charity so we will command that it be given to you
7899101 o qubaysah begging is not permitted except for one of three categories of people a man who has incurred debt as guarantor to reconcile blood wit for him begging is permissible till he pays that off after which he must stop it a man whose property has been destroyed by calamity which has smitten him for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support life or will provide him reasonable subsistence and a man who has been smitten by poverty the genuineness of which should be confirmed by three knowledgeable members of his people for him begging is permissible till he gets what will support him or will provide him subsistence besides these three qubaysah begging is forbidden for every other persons and one who engages in such consumes that which is forbidden
7899102 o messenger of allah you commanded us to give zakaat and i have jewelry that i wanted to assess for zakaat but my husband abdullah bin mas ud claimed that his son deserves it more than anyone
7899103 charity to the poor is only charity but charity to the rest of kind is charity and maintenance of relations sillah
7899104 allah has mandated on you zakaat to be taken from the wealthy and to be given to the poor

7899273 en la ma ana de hoy en una rueda de prensa el presidente lvaro uribe la ha emprendido contra mi gobierno haciendo acusaciones temerarias sin fundamento nunca probadas ni denunciadas ante la justicia en lo que tiene que ver con mi actuaci n o la de mis ministros siempre he respondido por todas mis actuaciones mas parece un mecanismo de distracci n que un asunto relevante para el ex men de los problemas colombianos de hoy a los ciudadanos les consta que he sido respetuoso del jefe del estado y he tratado de ser objetivo y ponderado lamento el lenguaje grosero intemperante y agresivo del presidente uribe l puede estar seguro que no va a acallar mi voz con ese lenguaje as como esperamos no logre amilanar a la corte suprema de justicia ni a los dem s poderes del estado ha hecho mucho por deslegitimar sus actuaciones ojal que no logre sacrificar la libertad de prensa con sus acusaciones intimidantes el presidente debe dedicarse a colaborar con la fiscal a por las manipulaciones que desde palacio se han montado contra la corte suprema en connivencia con los paramilitares y deber a actuar con la compostura y el equilibrio que le eviten al pa s una investigaci n formal practicada por la corte penal internacional a nuestras autoridades por las obstrucciones a las acciones de nuestra justicia por delitos de lesa humanidad le quiero recordar al presidente que nuestros senadores y representantes son libres de expresar sus opiniones en relaci n con el acontecer pol tico y que eso va a ser as mientras en colombia haya estado de derecho el cual esta puesto en grave peligro por un presidente que quiere silenciar y subordinar a cada uno de sus contradictores a los periodistas y a los otros poderes

7899280 i am compelled by the insensitivity which the dead ends of wtf official channels have offered to plead for justice and my fears about the deleterious effect of such deadness on the future of our taekwondo sport to make this protest to you
7899281 the object of this petition is the poor officiating in the mens over 80kg quarter final tournament between nigeria chika chukwumerije and greece alexandro nicholaidias on august 23 in 2008 olympic games in beijing beijing science and technology university gymnasium
7899282 my locus standi what you may ask is my rightful interest in this matter i am a member of the taekwondo family a senior black belt a promoter of taekwondo in nigeria and the father of the short changed player in this disputed contest chika chukwumerije
7899283 in the second round of the contest alexandro held chika by his chest protector and attempted an ass kick on the head apparently in a desperate bid to wipe off chikas two point lead holding an opponent while kicking is a punishable offence by taekwondo rules the referees overlooked the infraction no point was deducted from alexandro
7899284 the attempted ass kick by alexandro totally missed chika who successfully ducked but the referees inexplicably awarded two marks to alexandro and he levelled up with chikas two point lead
7899285 we were told that the protest would be considered and a review was under way the next shock which hit us was a display on the television screen announcing a tournament for a third position and listing chika chukwumerije as a contestant this meant that our protest received merely a nominal nod but was never treated unlike the protest by britain in an earlier bout
7899286 from this account the following observations are noteworthy first by fair officiating this tournament should have ended 3 0 in favour of chika chukwumerije
7899287 on three occasions the referees stopped the fight and consulted among themselves thereby giving a strong impression that they were unsure of their readings of the contest please compare the stoppages in this fight with referee interventions in all the other taekwondo fights in this olympic games
7899288 the international image of taekwondo may be soiled and its standing in the comity of world sports lowered by a growing impression of subjective and unpredictable commitment of our referees to the rules of the game
7899289 the insensitivity of the taekwondo supervisory board to genuine protests against provable acts of poor officiating in accordance with the rules encourages anti compliance behaviour among practitioners compare the responses of the supervisory board to two protests britains and nigerias in an earlier bout womens under 57kg quarter finals the british coach angrily shot up from his seat like thunder bolt and protested in a loud voice against a case of poor officiating he aggressively followed up after the contest with a strong protest to the board the supervisory board reviewed the case played back the tape in full view of the audience and reversed the verdict of the judges in nigerias case the nigerian coach quietly waited like a law abiding practitioner till the end of the bout to make his protest nigeria avoided violence of fist or body language the supervisory board ignored our appeal and the review of the disputed contest did not take place we gathered from the grapevine that the supervisory council was afraid that a second reversal of an unjustified verdict would be one too many and could deal embarrassing damage to the image of world taekwondo federation

7899291 ive been watching the democratic convention for something like three hours now and i think claire mccaskill who just finished was the first speaker who actually took some time to make an argument against john mccain i understand that the theory of the day is that democrats want to introduce people to barack obama but it seems to me that its hardly impossible to work a few digs at the other guy into a talk thats mostly about the virtues of your candidate

7899347 bob barrs presidential campaign has recently learned of an action by the mccain campaign and the pennsylvania republican party to have barr removed from the states ballot this despite mccains promise in the 2000 election that he would
7899348 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
7899349 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
7899350 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
7899351 this is america where people have a right to run for office and a right to compete for the chance to lead the people of this nation

7899353 kimberly clark is working to bring you that world one box of kleenex and one forest at a time
7899354 we landed on the one that we think is best for our brand our business our customers and our associates
7899355 any time a function like marketing wants to spend money against an association and property whether its other sports or nascar you need to have the right rationale
7899356 in our case we can show why this makes sense for the home depot we fell very good about our participation in the sport
7899357 we think it helps us better connect with our customers and we know it inspires and excites our associates
7899358 we always take into consideration competitive factors but that wasnt an overwhelming consideration
7899359 we were trying to do what we felt was best for our brand and business and customers thats what drove our decision also based on the success weve had in this sport
7899360 was it a consideration that our competitors were in the sport yeah but not a controlling one or driving one by any stretch of the imagination
7899361 as the awareness builds and hes competitive youll take the fan that has a propensity to want to follow the home depot and shop in our stores were convinced the loyalty will be there and will grow over time
7899362 we totally acknowledge that when you look at the nascar fan base that point of consumer passion is the driver
7899363 they certainly acknowledge the race team but at the same time they really connect with the driver tony has his followings without a doubt but at the same time were totally convinced and excited about what joey represents and we feel he is going to appeal to a broad swath of our customer base 18 to 54 we dont see any downside to that
7899364 i dont like the notion of joey as the kid
7899365 i think what we see in joey is a mature young man who has the values the work ethic and the competence if you look at what joeys done already behind the wheel of a car it gives us comfort going forward
7899366 well be looking at all of that and were not ready to make any announcements
7899367 well put it against everything else that we do not within nascar as much as all the other things we try to do in the marketplace

7899387 im not sure you can say what the right amount is but what we do know is that there is some really worthy promising research thats not being funded right now because funds are limited

7899485 solange die gashebel nach vorne gelegt sind l sst sich der hebel berhaupt nicht bewegen
7899486 bei der ungl cksmaschine vom typ md 82 befinden sich die triebwerke am heck ziemlich nahe an der l ngsachse des flugzeugs bei einer schubumkehr auf einer seite d rfte die abweichung vom kurs deshalb eher gering ausfallen

7899507 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7899508 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7899509 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7899510 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top celebrity icon however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers

7899527 in the most ordinary of situations capital cases require more time to prepare and litigate and this kind of deadline would be impossible to meet adequately given the salience of torture in these cases as well as the due process national security and logistical restrictions on lawyers they are anything but ordinary
7899528 from the beginning the guant namo military commission system has been weighted in favor of the prosecution and the imposition of unreasonable deadlines for defense counsel is just another side of a fundamentally flawed system rushing through these proceedings in the blink of an eye and without even a semblance of fairness is unacceptable and makes a mockery of our justice system
7899529 proceedings that are conducted in such a biased way can offer no true sense of justice having been achieved all americans including the victims of 9 11 deserve better than an unfair system that results in an illegitimate outcome

7899551 they recognize that the shows in europe whether its in leipzig cologne or london we can do the announcements wherever
7899552 the midori incubation developed under eric rudder and thats basically taking the concepts of singularity which is a totally managed net collected os and investigating ways to make the operating system really scalable across different nodes and asynchronous responsive and theyve got this asynchronous programing model theyre building on top of that
7899553 as far as the future of windows and windows being something not based on what widows is today im working in windows im not working in midori im not working in some other incubation so i think that kind of answers the question right there about what i think will happen to windows and that is that the future will be windows of some kind
7899554 it just doesnt make sense to me what amazes me is that people just say lets throw everything away and start over because theres so much thats been invested in things that are in windows
7899555 if you look at how much work has been put into the kernel the windows kernel is in my opinion and the numbers back this up the most scalable kernel the one that supports the most drivers of any kernel hardware devices than any kernel on the planet if you just focus on the pc hardware and server class hardware
7899556 and thats just a huge investment a huge asset that weve got and i dont think that it makes sense to just toss that it does a great job and its not perfect and theres no kernel thats perfect or os thats perfect but thats probably million of man years of work thats gone into tunning it and designing it and implementing it

7899576 i thought that if the christian religion were true i could not be forgiven and therefore was expecting and almost at times wishing to know the worst
7899577 our very last victuals were boiling in the pot before we had been there two hours the wind began to blow with great violence if we had continued at sea that night in our shattered enfeebled condition we would to all human appearance have gone to the bottom about this time i began to know that there is a god who hears every prayer though i can see no reason why the lord singled me out for mercy
7899578 i believe for some years i never was an hour in any company without attempting to corrupt them
7899579 a ship that ranked lowest in the maritime world a ship engaged in the slave trade
7899580 rather pitied than scorned by the meanest lowest of her slaves
7899581 during the time i was engaged in the slave trade
7899582 i never had the least scruple as to its lawfulness
7899583 very few slave ships made it to the americas without losing many of the slaves to sickness suicide or mutiny
7899584 on one of his voyages john newton did not lose a single slave he was one of the few slave ship captains in history to do so
7899585 i resigned the command the day before she sailed and thus i was unexpectedly called from that service and freed from a share of the future consequences of that voyage which proved extremely calamitous the person who went in my room most of the officers and many of the crew died and the vessel was brought home with great difficulty
7899586 i had often prayed that the lord in his own time would be pleased to place me in a more humane calling
7899587 i longed to be freed from these long separations from home which were often hard to bear my prayers were now answered though in a way i little expected
7899588 ignorantly considering it as the line of life which divine providence had allotted me
7899589 i was once an active instrument in a business at which my heart now shudders
7899590 a blessing both as a christian and as a statesman

7899691 iranian gulf consultations have not stopped and the latest was amir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalifah al thanis visit to tehran last week and the meeting of the joint iranian omani military committee in muscat yesterday
7899692 kuwait was not consulted or expressed an opinion on this question it did not receive any request or desire to possibly invite the iranian president to the upcoming gcc summit
7899693 the sultanate of oman will be sending the invitations to the summit because it will be chairing it therefore it remains a sovereign right concerning the sultanate alone as for us we have not received anything about this matter
7899694 the iranian presence at the recent summit in doha caused much embarrassment especially for the uae side in addition to the iranian officials statements about closing the straits of hormuz and the opening of iranian officials in the occupied uae islands this signals that the gulf countries will not accept the iranian presence even if some parties invited president ahmadinejad to attend it
7899695 gcc foreign ministers who will attend their 108th meeting which is scheduled to be held on tuesday in jeddah under qatars chairmanship might discuss such a request if it was presented officially amid speculations that it will not be officially submitted to the conferees since three months separate us from the summit and the issue still remains under discussion but if it was submitted unofficially then we would voice our opinion of it but would not make any decision before it is officially submitted
7899696 such a question concerns the host country and it is one of its affairs

7899701 la tasa nacional de homicidios en 2008 muestra una reducci n del 10 por ciento con 2007 lo que muestra que hoy tenemos 1 041 muertes violentas menos que el a o pasado en medell n y antioquia el hecho de que en 2008 han habido m s homicidios que en 2007 y se interprete como un fracaso en la seguridad ciudadana es un error porque las regresiones presentan ciclos es importante reconocer de d nde venimos y a d nde vamos para que esfuerzos como los que acumula medell n no se desvanezcan por la coyuntura no quiere decir que estemos tranquilos y sabemos que hay un gran reto
7899702 cerca de 48 000 desmovilizados de las auc y la guerrilla se han reintegrado voluntariamente a la sociedad ese n mero es todo un reto para una sociedad cuando uno valora el n mero de asesinatos de desmovilizados estamos llegando de marzo de 2006 a la fecha a casi mil creemos que esa cifra es injustificable algunos desmovilizados han seguido delinquiendo el proceso de delaci n y sometimiento a la justicia ha llevado a algunos miembros de esos grupos a asesinar a subalternos y ha habido homicidios que se presentan en el marco de la violencia social

7899708 le quiero decir a los habitantes de medell n y antioquia que una vez conocidos por los medios de comunicaci n estos hechos el general pedreros solicit a la fiscal a general de la naci n a trav s de un derecho de petici n que se le informara si estaba siendo investigado o no

7899808 sometimes the residents give us some food but sometimes we sleep hungry
7899809 one reason for the urban food crisis is the huge gap between demand and supply
7899810 the demand is increasing beyond expectation while the supply is less
7899811 increases in staple food prices are coming at a time of already high and extreme levels of food insecurity in some regions
7899812 at the same time livestock prices and labour rates have increased only minimally further reducing the overall purchasing power of poor and very poor households
7899813 when local production fails to feed the people one looks at global markets
7899814 but despite ethiopias move to import food from the international market the prices are still not affordable to urban dwellers
7899815 the global situation has affected the response not the problem
7899816 the problem remains the increasing population and poor farming methods there has to be emphasis on helping people to recover
7899817 previously farmers brought their products and sold to wholesalers without prefixed price

7899826 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia and un agencies in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance

7899877 this the missile shield deal will certainly not make the negotiations any easier
7899878 in the event that russia uses its oil supplies to put pressure on poland it will provide a test case for the eu as to how far it will go to support poland

7899901 payscale takes it to the next level its very scientific
7899902 by working together to offer an inside look at companies we can open access and bring greater transparency to information in one of the most important parts of our lives our work

7899908 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
7899909 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
7899910 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
7899911 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas

7899913 they started to get together immediately as a result they had a plan that got approved in june they created a system theyre proud of

7899924 of all the systems of religion that ever were invented there is no more derogatory to the almighty more unedifying to man more repugnant to reason and more contradictory in itself than this thing called christianity
7899925 during almost 15 centuries has the legal establishment of christianity been on trial what have been its fruits more or less in all places pride and indolence in the clergy ignorance and servility in laity in both superstition bigotry and persecution
7899926 my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for thinking i shall ever change them
