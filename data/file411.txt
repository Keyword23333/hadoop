4110001 im gonna shake you off cause the lovin aint the same and you keep on playing games when you know im here to stay
4110002 this is a reflection of their mugabe insincerity they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans
4110003 the fun part about animation especially in the clone wars in particular is that were allowed to go and do stories about clones we get to know them and find out what they do for recreation and what jabba the huts family is all about do all kinds of things that dont have anything to do with the main character the film itself the series itself the epic itself is basically about one man so its very very narrow you pass through a lot of things and you look whats that over there but you never get to look at it so this allows us to go and look at all that stuff which means were not encumbered by this mythological uberstory of the psychological underpinnings of why somebody turns to be a bad person
4110004 gee its too bad because theres a great its like world war ii its a huge canvas there to be mined
4110005 we decided we would do a little five minute animation series for cartoon network using anime and manga and those kind of ideas that ive always wanted to work in that sort of got me going and saying
4110006 well its challenging art is a technological medium all art is so a lot of it has to do with engineering trying to figure out how to create what you imagine it is also a medium that is dictated primarily by any amount of resources you have available to you if youre a pharaoh you can build pyramids if youre a shaman you really only have a few pieces of chalk and a wall of a cave and you have to work within that probably the most daunting thing we were trying to do because we wanted to really push the limits and make what just started out as a tv show that was really beyond anything youve ever seen on television to take feature animation which costs 20 30 times what tv animation costs and do that for television something that actually looked like feature animation for television that was a challenge given enough time and money anybody can create anything but given a very very restricted budget and very very restricted resources its a challenge so we had to build studios we had to build a studio from scratch train people from scratch artists develop new techniques we did not make this in the normal way you make an animated feature
4110007 you need people available every week and you cant really afford multimillion dollar actors to do a television series
4110008 look were doing a feature would you like to do the voice in the feature
4110009 could you come in in a month in four weeks and do this can we have two days
4110010 yeah it would be great ill come in and do it

4110012 tonys a great competitor in a great many ways because hes tough but hes also respectful
4110013 hes been a good friend on and off the racetrack specifically off hes done a lot to help me and guide me hes an indiana boy so i have a different respect for him because of that but in general hes just a hard nosed racer and ive always appreciated him for that whether we argue on the racetrack or not were two hard nosed racers

4110019 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4110020 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4110021 enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of citizens must not be to the detriment of the interests of society or the state
4110022 the partnership subscribes to a number of plusses first as a consequence of initiatives of corporate companies such as the development bank to increasingly embark on below the line communications such as exhibitions our industry is growing closer to advertising agencies to support them in their quest to deliver a holistic communications service to their clients secondly we try to deliver a cost effective and environmental friendly service through refurbishing our materials and apply them to the same brand yet still giving it a completely new look and feel thirdly we are proud about the ability of our africa network to become more independent in the sourcing of exhibition and display materials and to construct with our exact directives we shipped the drawings photographs and specifications to our partner in accra who built the stand in only two days this has saved both the agency and the dbsa the cost of shipping the materials for their booth as well as the transfer of our staff

4110041 it speaks volumes about how good a job tfl are doing that their own executives are choosing to shun tubes and buses and make the taxpayer fork out for their taxis
4110042 its outrageous i work long hours and i have no choice but to use the tubes and buses i dont particularly feel safe at night
4110043 a taxi would be nice but as a public sector worker i feel its wrong to use taxis and then claim it back on expenses
4110044 it shows they are out of touch if they can opt out of the tubes they dont see the pain people go through no wonder things dont get better

4110050 we are excited to have the chance to work on one of the most successful tv properties of recent years
4110051 deal or no deal is a phenomenally successful programme particularly in the uk and we look forward to creating games that will bring the true spirit of the series to a new audience on mobile platforms
4110052 at endemol we have been looking for a partner in the mobile space to help bring this phenomenal property to an even broader audience
4110053 we do have a very large gap in the middle the lower middle and median income families the cost of college has outrun affordability in too many cases
4110054 more people would have to lose money to the lottery and that creates all kinds of social effects
4110055 we have not done very well with the family and social services administration and toll road privatization projects
4110056 with bonding the state would keep control therefore the public would keep control
4110057 who would probably never have the opportunity to go to college unless a program like this is available
4110058 i think its going to be very difficult for the governor to get a privatization plan through the legislature for the lottery consider what happened with family and social services administration and the indiana toll road
4110059 would make it obviously very valuable to indiana state students as well
4110060 jill and i firmly believe that every county every community and every citizen of indiana matters
4110061 how long has it been since you felt like you had a seat at the table and a voice in the discussion
4110062 but if you are looking for real positive meaningful change for indiana you dont need to look any further than gov daniels and myself in 2004 we said we were people of change and we meant it in 2004 we said what we would do and we did it
4110063 im beginning to talk to a lot of farmers now that statements are going out and they do feel like they are unduly burdened
4110064 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4110065 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4110066 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4110067 i sometimes struggle just to get essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
4110068 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
4110069 has abandoned his pledge to be above politics as usual
4110070 opening offices in indiana and running ads here didnt move his numbers an inch so hes going negative
4110071 now hoosiers should brace for three months of negativity you can believe in

4110075 we have to take action to ease the pain of a crisis thats putting people out on the streets devastating our neighborhoods and endangering children
4110076 as i walk through the neighborhoods of house district 97 every night i see streets lined with boarded up homes once well maintained yards full of trash and weeds and the burned out remains of vacant properties these abandoned houses attract gangs criminals and illegal dumping we must do more to stabilize and rebuild neighborhoods that continue to be devastated by this epidemic
4110077 i believe my proposal will help prevent future losses and provide immediate assistance to those who need help now
4110078 with the financial situation the citys in right now were not in a position to hire anyone
4110079 until we find some way out of this financial dilemma
4110080 ive even been told that were buying cheaper tires that arent even sized for the truck
4110081 i just decided it was time for me to move on and maybe do something on a national level
4110082 my departure doesnt have anything to do with the mayor or my position on the budget

4110107 i am pleased to report that since the filming rob calmed down and finally made some peace with ron who convinced him that hed really been trying to sacrifice himself so rob would go on to win
4110108 ron just couldnt explain it properly under the heat of the lights and the moment and thus robs explosion

4110112 the video component provides a higher grade material of course
4110113 but we can extract energy from radio transmission as well we even look forward to a time when we can simply use pre recorded transmissions again and again thus doing away with the need for politicians at all

4110120 i think when you look to winning games the way this league is with injuries you want the best 53 players on the team and i think with the position ive put myself in i qualify as one of the best 53 players
4110121 my job is to play football so im going to be out there as much as i can when im able to take care of my hamstring i take care of it
4110122 it was before that i wasnt in my groove i was mad before that i made a good play and it got our teammates pumped up

4110129 the health of missouri baptist churches remains my highest concern
4110130 i am convinced that many of our problems will be resolved when our churches are healthy
4110131 but in a way that smiths church community would not know she had participated thomas told smith that hiding her participation from other church members should be sufficient to overcome any religious objection
4110132 i know it and my father knows and thats all that matters
4110133 its not about what other people think and its not about pushing my view or theology on other people

4110139 conduct was objectively reasonable taken in good faith and did not violate any clearly established rights
4110140 lets just say that there were many people who were skeptical of us and of what we were doing in rockaway
4110141 there were about four or five new churches of different denominations that had attempted to start churches in rockaway beach right before bridge of faith got there every last one of them failed
4110142 they didnt see a difference between us and those other churches so we had to prove that what we were about is what we said we were about no hidden agendas
4110143 we had to be careful because a broken promise was a broken promise to them
4110144 it wouldnt matter if it was a legitimate reason or not all the community would know is that a promise was made and a promise was broken
4110145 i became the vice president of the chamber of commerce and through that i got to know many of the city leaders and business leaders in the community
4110146 the community started hearing about the positive things we are doing and they have come around
4110147 we have had an average of 60 kids for wednesday night youth group

4110165 the forecast shows that orlando continues to be the strongest residential real estate market in the state because of its large share of fast growing industries such as tourism healthcare education and defense manufacturing
4110166 however that gap is expected to close by year end as the number of homes currently under contract 3 258 is 26 72 percent greater than the number of homes that were under contract in july 2007 2 571 pending sales for the past three months have been greater than their 2007 counterparts
4110167 there are several new condos planned over the next two years and a few condo conversions taking place in the downtown area be wise when shopping for a condo as the market seems over saturated
4110168 the rest of metro orlando may have an average of 5 percent of all homes for sale but in the lake mann sunset lake and clear lake areas only 1 4 percent of homes are on the market
4110169 we would have handled some meetings differently watched our words more closely and been more aware of the agenda of their state press we wanted to just slip in and out but thats nearly impossible for me to do anymore
4110170 the trouble with our liberal friends isnt that theyre ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so

4110174 christian faith surely must be concerned in some degree with political questions and surely christian belief has affected political forms from age to age and will continue to affect the political modes but to assume that christian dogmata meant to order the soul can be applied without qualification to the multitudinous prudential concerns of the civil social order well that way lies much confusion and violence christian faith may transform this world through working upon the minds and the hearts of many human beings b ut the christian church is no instrument for administering secular justice conducting secular diplomacy or waging war

4110179 a n interesting thing happened after the waters had receded and the reporters and television cameras had moved on to other stories christians especially conservative christians stayed and they continued to deliver money resources and goods to the caring citizens looking to rebuild that tortured city even as late as march six months after hurricane katrina struck faith based groups provided a nearly bottomless well of labor southern baptists alone provided over 14 million meals
4110180 they care so much about the poor they will even help them when the television cameras have gone away
4110181 i did not want to look back on this and have to look god in the eye and have him say why didnt you do something i gave you a big mouth why didnt you use it
4110182 the church is not a business not an experiment not a product to be sold it is an outpost of the kingdom a sign of things to come in christs sovereign rule which is now hidden but will be made open and public then all the world will bow before him in recognition of who he is

4110190 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4110191 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4110192 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4110193 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4110194 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
4110195 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
4110196 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4110197 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4110198 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues

4110217 graspr recently launched its syndication network with favorable results weve acquired three times as many publishers as we had anticpated at this point our user engagement metrics such as amount of time spent on our site and number of page and video views show that were impressively competing with leading sites in our market

4110223 este sabado 16 de agosto se ha pautado para las 10 00 de la ma ana su llegada al congreso nacional
4110224 la controversia suscitada por algunos medios de comunicaci n en torno al gesto que realizan los jugadores de la selecci n espa ola masculina
4110225 una campa a publicitaria previa a los juegos ol mpicos de beijing
4110226 tal y como afortunadamente ha entendido la inmensa mayor a del p blico espa ol e internacional y ha corroborado la embajada de la rep blica popular china en espa a el nico significado de dicho gesto es de cari o simpat a y reconocimiento que es lo que siente esta federaci n por el pueblo chino y su pa s
4110227 la feb mantiene una ya larga relaci n con el baloncesto de la rep blica popular china con cuyo desarrollo est comprometida lo que se refleja tanto en la estrecha colaboraci n en la formaci n de rbitros jugadores y entrenadores como en la regular visita
4110228 de los diferentes equipos de la federaci n de baloncesto de la rep blica popular china para competir y preparar sus competiciones internacionales invitados por la feb
4110229 adem s de las relaciones deportivas la feb ha sido una de las primeras federaciones del mundo en mantener tambi n relaciones comerciales con instituciones y empresas chinas como la firma de ropa deportiva li ning cuyo contrato suscrito con la feb es el m s antiguo de sus acuerdos
4110230 molten y lenovo que apoy el pasado europeo 2007 disputado en espa a son otros de los patrocinadores asi ticos de la feb el primero de los cuales ya contribuy decididamente hace dos a os en el mayor xito de la historia del baloncesto espa ol la medalla de oro del campeonato del mundo conquistada en 2006 precisamente en jap n
4110231 por todo ello la feb considera que esta pol mica del todo gratuita se ha generado desde la mala fe por parte de unos medios que han querido da ar la imagen no s lo de la propia feb sino tambi n de nuestro pa s y nuestro deporte por lo que se reserva las acciones legales pertinentes para salvaguardarla
4110232 una vez hecho p blico este comunicado con el que da por cerrada la cuesti n la feb no realizar ninguna otra declaraci n al respecto
4110233 ese gesto el de los jugadores rasg ndose los ojos no lo entendemos como una ofensa
4110234 que los espa oles lleguen a ofender en china a los chinos
4110235 ltimamente hay muy buena relaci n entre el gobierno chino y el espa ol y entre los dos pueblos no hay ning n tipo de conflicto
4110236 muchas veces el gobierno andaba muy bien y no nos iba bien en las encuestas eso pasaba normalmente
4110237 hay que mirarlos como una fotograf a hay que preocuparse pero no hay que verlos como una cosa terminal

4110245 in addition to accelerated measures internally we are actively engaged in helping our customers reach leed certification
4110246 while many carpets made today meet cris green label plus standards brintons carpet offers an additional advantage for leed certification our woven carpets are made primarily of natural materials such as wool that qualify as a rapidly renewable material also the well recognized longevity of woven axminster carpet should not be discounted in weighing the impact of an extended product life cycle in relation to environmental issues
4110247 we are very pleased with the initiatives being taken by our customers and applaud their commitment
4110248 we will continue to encourage the environmental efforts of our customers as well as develop more efficient and progressive programs that also enhance brintons overall green performance
4110249 the projects sponsor was in need of additional capital sources outside of their customary banking relationships and jones lang lasalle hotels was able to identify multiple lenders that met our clients needs

4110254 i had one girl stop and was like racist are you serious with that really
4110255 with the song i was just trying to follow what i thought and what i needed to do now its just like obviously i know what the f k im doing
4110256 a lot of people told me not to do this song he says
4110257 they told me not to push it but i did it anyway because i felt so strongly about it
4110258 hey guys i have an idea since the games are in
4110259 if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason then all possibility of life is destroyed
4110260 dont worry youre not the only one thats gonna get screwed
4110261 there is a crisis ive devised new policies to deal with it and we will lead britain through
4110262 may i remind all passengers that there is strictly no smoking allowed on any part of the underground however if you are smoking a joint it is only fair that you pass it round the rest of the carriage
4110263 to the gentleman wearing the long grey coat trying to get on the second carriage what part of stand clear of the doors dont you understand
4110264 next time you might find it easier to wait until the doors are open before trying to get on the train
4110265 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4110266 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4110267 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4110268 screw the ozone layer screw the environment and screw the people of the united states
4110269 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4110270 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4110271 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4110272 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4110273 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4110274 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4110275 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4110276 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4110277 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4110278 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4110279 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4110280 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4110281 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4110282 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4110283 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4110284 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4110285 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4110286 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4110287 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4110288 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4110289 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4110290 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4110291 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4110292 ron would love to have an ordinary regular love affair give up porn
4110293 now ill have to get a hyundai instead of a lexus
4110294 im so sorry jordan ive got some terrible news grandma died
4110295 it all happened within just a few hours of jordan arriving at the house so it wasnt because he started to lose it and wanted off the show
4110296 jordan was far too emotionally shaken up with the news of her death to continue and it was impossible for the continuous filming to be halted for him to return and resume two weeks later
4110297 in two weeks the southampton pumpkin ale will be ready

4110312 anul acesta am preluat planul de restructurare a postei din mers si urmeaza ca la anul guvernul viitor sa vada care este cea mai buna solutie
4110313 in momentul cand se ia o decizie pentru privatizarea unei companii exista o perioada de 2 3 4 ani cand respectiva companie este pregatita cand se lanseaza stirea ca statul vrea sa privatizeze o societate creste si interesul pentru aceasta se alege un consultant si se poate merge in doua directii finalizarea privatizarii sau nu vom vedea anul viitor ce decizie vor lua ministerul comunicatiilor si fondul proprietatea actionarii societatii
4110314 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4110315 we believe that picis continues to be the system of choice for hospitals that want to automate their entire perioperative suite
4110316 todays operating room is expected to be the most efficient and highest revenue producing department of the hospital yet it is also where patient safety is at highest risk the leading health systems cannot afford to compromise with systems that do just the basics the environment today is too demanding and thats why more health providers choose picis than any other system
4110317 this will make any hope of cooperative effort on iran much more difficult
4110318 the last serious issue where the bush administration has decisions to make in terms of changing policy
4110319 the one place of high national security interest to the united states where russia plays a direct role in what we are trying to do in that sense it towers over all these other things
4110320 this has come at a very opportune time for iran
4110321 any new rift between the us and russians would be welcome by iran anything that give iran more time and a little more headache for the us
4110322 up to a point iran would be quietly happy but the conflict can escalate to something that would cause more instability and suffering
4110323 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims
4110324 some of our partners far from assisting us are attempting to impede us by transferring georgian troops on board us aircraft directly to the conflict zone
4110325 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4110326 georgia is a marginal issue to the united states iran is a central issue
4110327 seriously limit its response to georgia to avoid a russian counter in iran
4110328 even if there are no more un sanctions on iran at least there can still be more us and european sanctions
4110329 nuclear and missile entities used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
4110330 i think russia has been playing us when it comes to sanctions and stringing it out for years and years
4110331 theyve never wanted sanctions and our position has moved to theirs not vice versa if you go back 12 years ago we were debating whether there should be a bushehr nuclear reactor now we are well beyond that today

4110345 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

4110350 when something is run by the government it is usually inefficient and wasteful

4110356 people taking staycations are not necessarily entertaining themselves at home
4110357 on the contrary many are participating in travel related activities that generate significant revenues for restaurants attractions theme parks as well as hotels and resorts
4110358 although staycations appear to be a real phenomenon the results of this survey suggest that their potential negative impact on the domestic travel industry will be far less than expected based on the extensive coverage this phenomenon has received in the press

4110360 that connect with the citys economic advantages such as wine production and defence

4110362 when choosing your next conference destination or venue dont let competency be an issue
4110363 over the past five years weve seen enormous growth in meetings as a tool for companies to build communities not only among the people who work for them but also throughout the supply chain stakeholders and further these meetings are no longer simply a bit of fun but the lifeblood of organisations
4110364 it was very interesting to come to the forum and understand the true size and scope of the meetings industry at the moment poland has quite a new and rather small national convention bureau and i wasnt sure what i would achieve by coming i quickly understood that its important for everyone at a country level to understand the bigger picture ive enjoyed meeting people from other countries and also other parties and now it is obvious how important convention bureaus are within a country
4110365 i think the big achievement of the day was creating this dialogue between different people on the front lines the meetings industry policy makers and politicians very often neither side understands what the other wants or needs this forum represents a valuable chance for people to engage in meaningful debate
4110366 i am a great believer that if you can measure it you can manage it the adelaide convention centre hosted events that contributed 70 million to the states economy in 2006 07 by having clear measurements in place we can see precisely what contribution the industry is making to the city and where we need to plan for additional resources to support future growth such as transport labour education and training
4110367 even in this current climate where many airlines are reviewing their networks our team is always on the look out for potential routes that could do with added competition and where we can make a difference by bringing down over priced airfares
4110368 we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money
4110369 in england we have such good manners that if someone says something impolite the police will get involved christian bale i believe whilst in a restaurant rolled his eyes at the lighting that is an offense punishable by five years in prison in the united kingdom
4110370 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4110371 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4110372 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4110373 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls

4110454 there was a little doubt if i was supposed to be here
4110455 i take it as an audition for every team out there
4110456 if i dont make this team there are 31 other teams that might need me i proved to myself i deserve to be on an nfl team
4110457 i really want to get into a routine of getting prepared for a game even if i dont play going through the warm ups getting a sweat really feeling like im about to go out and play and just from that point obviously not play
4110458 neither one will be out much longer we just want to make sure when theyre back that we dont have recurring incidents
4110459 the only way i can make things happen is go hard every play
4110460 you can tell talking to a kid on the phone if its for real
4110461 you could really hear the love of the game in his voice
4110462 thats how ive been all my life trying to work
4110463 theres always been someone else being that main person so i told myself the only way i can make things happen is go hard every play
4110464 just to be able to show everybody that just because five six or nine five isnt in the game dont think you can just come out and do whatever you want the key is to be that backup guy and not have a dropoff
4110465 wiser smarter so i dont have to think about everything
4110466 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
4110467 i had this discussion this morning with some guys over coffee
4110468 from mowing roadsides and driving country roads i would say crops dont look near as good as last year the beans are starting to look better but they were dumpy all summer corn ears look smaller from the windshield tour
4110469 if we would happen to get an early september frost it could be very bad
4110470 i think theyre probably a little high in talking about the second best corn crop ever
4110471 but for as wet as it was early and lots of stuff getting planted late this area is looking pretty good
4110472 we had 200 bushel corn here last year and i had had 62 bushel beans
4110473 im imagining were 15 bushels below that on corn still it looks better than much of the state
4110474 i only saw two good fields of corn and those were five miles south of cedar point amusement park most of the corn is light green and all the fields have water damage the soybeans are short knee high so i dont know where theyre coming up with their projections
4110475 out our way i dont think were down too much from last year maybe just a little bit i was kind of hoping we were going to be able to match last years crops but i think our corn and beans are in as good a shape as anywhere
4110476 represents a mass market benchmark as more than 50 of the us population 155
4110477 a lot of these new plug ins evolved out of tools wed had before
4110478 but the intensity of the journey production forced us to put more into the existing tools as well as create brand new ones to manage the complexity of the stereoscopic workflow the grim reality is that native tools just cant do an adequate job we developed these out of necessity
4110479 about two months before we started to work on the project we got a few test shots and started looking at them
4110480 we thought about creating separate project workspaces for each of the eyes so the idea was to work on the right eye and then copy everything that had been done for the right eye over into a new workspace for the left eye but it became very clear early on that this setup would result in a lot of investment in time and hardware
4110481 we were trying to determine whether or not the difference between the two could be reduced or removed or if the threshold was large enough that a well rounded keyer could take care of it
4110482 our vfx supervisor mike shand was trying this one day and found the workflow of copying and pasting tools too time consuming and decided to combine the two images into a single frame by increasing the canvas size and putting the left image on top and the right image on the bottom
4110483 the idea was to be able stack images top bottom side by side or interlace them in the output image
4110484 scripting let us view only left or right only flows at any given time meaning you need less time to generate previews prior to this id been working on a system that would create a linked but separate workspace for each eye such that the artist would get near final with work done on one eye and then run a script that would spawn the second eye we would use the right eye as a sort of layout and have scripts to mark certain tools as being left eye specific such as roto masks so that future updates to the right eye could be ported to the left eye with another script it became obvious early on that this was going to be wrought with problems
4110485 in an abstracted way in the same comp window the stacking method that mike shand came up with provided an easy out it made the process of compositing two eyes both intuitive and well managed
4110486 to be able to work on a single eye to be able to create masks independently for each eye to be able to separate the images for processes that do image sampling such as blurs as the act of combining the two images into a single frame would cause blurs to bleed through the median point a way to view the images in rudimentary stereo in comp and a visible way to tell the images apart the results are a few tools that allow you to select the eye the tool should be outputting and the eye that the comp is currently active with so that you can work in stereo and in mono in the same comp
4110487 the nice thing was that the director eric brevig really considered it to be a character as well
4110488 whats going to happen when more of these 3d movies get made
4110489 is the language of 2d film will have to change significantly as the 3d medium matures there will be a lot more interesting uses of 3d that will result i assume people like james cameron with films in progress like avatar are doing with 3d what hitchcock did when he analyzed his films hitchcock found that moving the camera right created a sense of forward momentum and moving the camera left created a sense of foreboding unfortunately a lot of that language is diluted when its in a 3d environment journey did a lot to clarify that new language and it will be a wild ride as we all map it out together

4110517 the threat by a section of odm to pull out of the grand coalition is unfortunate because the coalition is based on the unity accord enacted by parliament
4110518 no coalition can be based on lies and those calling for mass action should be sincere and stop giving flimsy excuses as grounds for pulling out of the coalition mass action by misguided political leaders is what is misleading secondary children into violence

4110559 are you a teacher of israel and you do not understand this i tell you i tell you what i know and i bear witness to what i have seen but you do not receive my testimony

4110563 i speak unto my servant moses i appeared unto abraham to isaac and to jacob as god almighty but by my name the lord i did not make myself known unto them
4110564 when they ask me what is his name what must i say
4110565 not with the gospels not with the letters he begins with the old testament he begins with the law of moses then he comes to the prophets he comes into the psalms and
4110566 i have made known thy name and i will make it known that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them

4110569 dua is conversation with allah out creator our lord and master the all knowing the all powerful this act in itself is of extraordinary significance it is the most uplifting liberating empowering and transforming conversation a person can ever have we turn to him because we know that he alone can lift our sufferings and solve our problems we feel relieved after describing our difficulties to our creator we feel empowered after having communicated with the all mighty we sense his mercy all around us after talking to the most merciful
4110570 there are two arabic words in commone use related to prayer they are salat and du a salat in its arabic sense signifies the liturgical form of worship prescribed by the prophet du a simply means petition or supplication addressed to god by the supplicant while he is walking standing sitting or resting it is without any prescribed form and may be concerning any matter spiritual or temporal
4110571 whosoever desires that allah answers his duas in unfavorable and difficult conditions he should make plentiful dua in days of ease and comfort
4110572 the person who does not ask from allah allah becomes angry with him
4110573 know that allah does not answer a dua from a distracted heart
4110574 the dua of a muslim for his brother in his absence is readily accepted
4110575 whatever difficulties or troubles are encountered by human being god always provides a solution a way out a relief a way to lead to ease and happiness if we follow his path and show our faith and patience and well doing the solution or relief does not merely come after the difficulty it is provided with it

4110785 troop c also known as carnage troop fly the latest oh 58d kiowa warrior which is primarily operated in an armed recon role in support of ground troops
4110786 pilots are briefed on the 5 ws who what where when and why in respect to the ops portion of the brief the crews receive instructions on what the ground cmdrs want along with any changes in procedures or radio frequencies pilots receive any changes in battlespace and updates as to what friendly forces are in the area of ops
4110787 we find patterns and trends the enemy might be engaged in like ied small arms fire and emplacements we give the pilots an assessment so they know what to look for how the enemy might act and what to expect
4110788 the right seat pilot is the primarily eyes out and concentrates on air traffic avoidance the right seat directs the flight with regards to where they are going and what the priorities of recon are
4110789 the left seat co pilot manages the sensor and operates both the navigation system and communications within the aircraft
4110790 the lead aircraft is the primary shooter and navigator the trail aircraft covers the lead
4110791 the trail also acts as a second pair of eyes should the lead aircraft take fire

4110794 as a clear indicator of the security gains in the area we can now focus on rebuilding the infrastructure in areas once plagued by insurgents and investing in its future the employees and students represent some of the finest examples of citizens of iraq

4110801 this is an important day for us and for iraq

4110803 there has been significant progress in iraq during the past year and a half that allowed firebolt to make this port visit to umm qasr
4110804 visits like this are important because they help reinforce the strong ties that already exist between our two navies this visit clearly demonstrates the coalition partnership in maritime security with the iraqi navy and our commitment to the goi and its people
4110805 this type of training really cuts to the heart of creating an iraqi force that can conduct missions on their own
4110806 this is a very important step for a country still working its way through the challenges of having a growing legal system
4110807 the iraqis are working very hard to ensure that they can continue to be the lead element in all ops for dhi qar and muthanna provinces

4110826 its possible that the studio will once again go into hibernation and that the ua coin will go to mgm
4110827 the private equity model of stripping assets is finally on the deathbed there is not going to be easy money for pirates to borrow to continue to loot companies soak them with debt pay themselves handsomely only to let the companies they buy rot in a death sentence

4110836 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
4110837 everyone thinks of changing the world but no one thinks of changing himself
4110838 this is a number that is going to make the fed very concerned
4110839 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4110840 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4110841 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
4110842 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4110843 wereldwijd is het gebruik van sociale netwerken met 25 procent gestegen
4110844 de grootste groei werd gerealiseerd in het midden oosten en afrika 66 procent gevolgd door europa 35 procent latijns amerika 33 procent en azi 23 procent in noord amerika is de groei daarentegen vertraagd tot amper 9 procent
4110845 dat heeft onder meer te maken met de inspanningen van facebook om zijn sociale netwerk ook aan te passen aan niet engelstaligen
4110846 based on the seriousness of the charges being made it is only appropriate that the fbi and other authorities begin investigating these allegations
4110847 ensure that a complete and thorough investigation was conducted and no additional action is necessary
4110848 its not good for the economy or long term inter ests of the state
4110849 doesnt the public ultimately have to be told what its being asked to decide
4110850 this is a listing of what is in the amendment
4110851 does it specifically list every nuance and every detail i would agree with everyone in the courtroom that it doesnt
4110852 we dont even have signs outside my intention is to spend one or two days a month down there my objective is to get close to the people who need services
4110853 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
4110854 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
4110855 in this case it was determined that we needed to move forward in a timely fashion
4110856 the company needs to be able to pay claims in the event of a large hurricane or a series of large hurricanes in a single year
4110857 handle this case appropriately and i think you know what i mean by that rejecting it
4110858 the company has repeatedly told us that mitigation results in reduced damages now theyre saying that even though the payouts have gone down they want their premiums to stay high and thats just wrong
4110859 if a business does well investors deserve to make a profit
4110860 if a business does poorly investors should not expect a return from their customers
4110861 it says that our campaign is focused on the future
4110862 i was tired of solving the problems of the world over a cup of coffee
4110863 thats the issue that is resonating the most in florida
4110864 our economy is hurting and we need to try to look into legislation thats going to improve the economic environment
4110865 we need to start to cherry pick special businesses that we think are going to be the best for the state
4110866 the time should be focused on addressing the critical needs of florida and the things that are important to citizens
4110867 ive realized there is so much i can bring to the state
4110868 with less time and less resources ive accomplished as much as they have
4110869 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4110870 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4110871 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4110872 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4110873 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4110874 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4110875 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4110876 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4110877 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4110878 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4110879 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4110880 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4110881 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4110882 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4110883 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4110884 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4110885 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4110886 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4110887 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4110888 mike understood how important it was to provide people with care not only is it the right thing to do but it is good business
4110889 to us it was just a natural event to name this facility after him
4110890 we are certainly here to remember mike davis and it brings a sense of sadness but were also here to honor his achievement and that brings a sense of pride
4110891 mike davis had a true servants heart you could always count on mike davis to fight a good fight and he was always successful he was successful because he was a good fellow
4110892 its a perfect way to recognize mike and his talents and dedication to the less fortunate
4110893 the fact that fewer bids came in this time is clearly a defeat for proponents of privatizing this toll road
4110894 i have not seen it done this way before and in a way i guess its good because transparency is important in this kind of deal
4110895 exceeds in a significant manner the requirements objectives in a beneficial way
4110896 theres no requirement that we have to short list anyone
4110897 thats a good number its enough to have some genuine competition its few enough for them to feel like theyve got a serious shot
4110898 of course everyone is upset at the timing of the meeting
4110899 it would have included a double deck costing 200 million
4110900 we were told by a number of lobbyists its a done deal its signed off many of the same things were hearing now
4110901 i think the most important thing is they let the governor and the cabinet know
4110902 the governor has shown he is responsive to public pressure if theres a significant amount of public pressure we may see an about face
4110903 the state should not encourage or approve any specific development plans be it an inland port or otherwise that due to site location or impact could compromise restoration efforts
4110904 theres been a cloud over our communities because of the uncertainty
4110905 im asking on behalf of the communities and behalf of the town of clewiston that it be a cloud of hope
4110906 what we would say to somebody by 8 a m is changed by 3 p m
4110907 not only would it be hasty i think it would be irresponsible
4110908 ya know were democrats we like to debate and discuss things to the nth degree
4110909 we let that all come to the surface and have fun with it
4110910 were trying to do a lot in a little bit of time
4110911 chuck is a great guy he did a great job considering the environment
4110912 all i ever wanted to do is to make these changes and grow the party and its working
4110913 were coming out of this were gonna be stronger for it so do not make the mistake that we are weakened from arguing within we are stronger for it
4110914 i know that is something his attorneys are working on now
4110915 if these animals could speak to a pollster they would probably tell you that mary jo kilroy isnt qualified to be elected dog catcher
4110916 sorry the blacks hate me more then the flaming libs like jason not strait
4110917 old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition
4110918 its difficult to walk away from your nominee but you have to put your country first
4110919 why should we give you more money when what we already gave you has produced more harm than help to those it was intended to serve
4110920 im reminded that the actions of those in power have enormous consequences a price that they themselves almost never have to pay
4110921 the actions of those in power have enormous consequences a price that they themselves almost never have to pay
4110922 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
4110923 pick the target freeze it personalize it and polarize it
4110924 if you push a negative hard enough and deep enough it will break through into its counter side
4110925 a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag
4110926 most people who serve in washington have been trained either as lawyers or as political operatives professions that tend to place a premium on winning arguments rather than solving problems
4110927 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
4110928 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4110929 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4110930 mr valeche is distorting her record because he doesnt have one of his own
4110931 i have not had a very serious tough election up until this primary
4110932 it is not like a primary where there would be a big fight
4110933 you have a number of folks with long roots and connections to the community the party and the executive committee
4110934 it is going to be a call in every chip you got situation
4110935 there are a lot of very conservative republicans in the district it is a huge republican area
4110936 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4110937 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4110938 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4110939 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4110940 we dont believe that this regulation goes into someones private home off campus
4110941 every so often there are students that are not willing to cooperate yet their health is deteriorating and we must take action
4110942 i think we all share that value but at the same time we felt that it was important to clarify that that was a choice that a student would ultimately be making not an obligation
4110943 this is the way it was before youre now reading it perhaps for the very first time and were sorry about that
4110944 i think that adversarial nature is one of the things that makes it something that student and faculty dont really want to participate in
4110945 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4110946 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4110947 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4110948 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4110949 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4110950 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4110951 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats
4110952 so that we can be absolutely certain with these findings and conclusions
4110953 i request the florida department of law enforcement to review state attorney mccabes findings and case file to ensure that a complete and thorough investigation was conducted and no additional action is necessary
4110954 believes it is prudent to have an additional independent review
4110955 dawsons dna profile was consistent with being the major contributor to the dna mixture
4110956 one in many trillions is considered a good match so the numbers arent strong
4110957 on the other hand you have to think what are the chances it was someone else when the odds are one in 30 000 did more than 30 000 people handle that gun probably not
4110958 unless they found spent casings at the crime scene that they would be able to trace back to the weapon it doesnt sound like that is a whole lot of information
4110959 anybody in the vicinity could test positive for gunshot residue because it goes all over the place
4110960 unless they found spent casings at the crime scene that they would be able to trace back to the weapon it doesnt sound like that is a whole lot of information
4110961 john kerry can and will fight for the truth on cable news but we need all of us to battle against the smears in every way
4110962 by signing up youll stay on top of the right wing smear machine and help us battle it back this site is designed for activists like you to take back the truth from the bush mccain politics of karl rove that have come to dominate the gop so sign up and join in the fight and start reporting in some smears
4110963 you cant just play defense against smears pointing out how they arent true
4110964 youve got to play offense too exposing the whole cynical game for what it is an attempt to keep us from talking about the real issues and ultimately changing our country for the better the republicans have nothing to run on no ideas to push no solutions for america theyll run a campaign of laughable gimmicks and outright distortions and lies but we can fight back with the truth and the truth can win this time lets do it
4110965 share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country
4110966 hi im deval patrick i am a democratic governor of a monolithically democratic state and ive done nothing substantive in my 1 years as governor but my back story is heartwarming and im making great progress on my memoirs thank you very much
4110967 the 368 billion federal program is a tempting target for crooks and there are signs the problem is growing it is particularly acute in south florida where is seems to be replacing drug trafficking as the crime of choice for those who want to get rich quick
4110968 their main mission is not to root out fraud it is to pay claims quickly and smoothly
4110969 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4110970 instead of the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4110971 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4110972 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4110973 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4110974 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4110975 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4110976 once the deal comes to the board it will be fast and furious
4110977 theres a lot of questions and not a lot of answers
4110978 there has been a cloud over our communities because of the uncertainty
4110979 we need the same priority for survival you would give the alligator the fish and the snail kite
4110980 providing e mail updates of his activities before and after the big night media interviews visits with the virginia delegates and backstage moments at the big event you name it
4110981 hows the voter supposed to know by reading the ballot title and summary that it only applies to one year
4110982 to me you take a quarter from over here you replace it with a quarter from over here isnt that what that says
4110983 does it specifically list every nuance and every detail i would agree with everyone in the courtroom that it doesnt
4110984 i dont know if im the average voter but it took me three hours to understand it
4110985 i went to the state supreme court a bunch of times and ive walked out of there thinking i lost and i won and i walked out of there thinking i won and i lost
4110986 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4110987 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4110988 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4110989 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4110990 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4110991 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4110992 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4110993 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4110994 on day 32 colbert democrats receive 8 247 more than the control
4110995 to give a sense of scale the average monthly amount received by all candidates at all points in time in the data is 21 107 so we are talking about a bump of roughly two fifths over the normal rate of receipts
4110996 we need fresh new leadership in washington d c a proven leader like mike huckabee he wasnt too well known on the campaign stump until he got his biggest break the stephen colbert bump
4110997 thats a 300 percent increase after a two and a half minute interview if he keeps up that pace between now and the election hell be the first candidate ever to get elected with 88 128 000 percent of the vote
4110998 wenn man sich diese zahlen vor augen h lt wird klar dass sterreich gefahr l uft sich zu einem berwachungsstaat zu entwickeln
4110999 die initiative platterwatch hat jetzt eine logische nachfolge gefunden denn auch nach dem r cktritt platters geht der ausbau des berwachungsstaats in sterreich ungehemmt weiter
4111000 wir hatten innerhalb von vier monaten ber eine mio zugriffe auf platterwatch at verzeichnet an die 53 000 menschen haben sich die dort eingestellten youtube videos angesehen
4111001 wir konnten aber nicht nur das thema berwachung st rker im ffentlichen bewusstsein verankern sondern auch 25 000 unterschriften f r unsere petition sammeln
4111002 das protokoll dieser sitzung liegt auf unserer webplattform auf daraus geht eindeutig hervor dass der einsatz von sogenannten spitzelboxen bereits diskutiert wird
4111003 es ist zwar zur zeit noch nicht gesagt dass die spitzelboxen f r ungerechtfertigte berwachungszwecke missbraucht werden aber die chancen daf r sind gro
4111004 you cannot have a ballot title and summary that are misleading and say its o k because the courts will fix it later on
4111005 russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them
4111006 it was a tough sell before but it was doable simply because we didnt have a choice we dont want to deny ourselves access to the space station the very place we have built and paid
4111007 its going to be a tougher sell now unless there are critical developments during the next 48 to 72 hours
4111008 if i were president id be pulling out all the stops to get russia to understand the consequences of continued bad behavior
4111009 we actually flew over georgia coming out of kazakhstan because the russians would not give us diplomatic overflight
4111010 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4111011 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4111012 adapted their unionbusting tactics to influence our federal election system
4111013 we welcome the fec looking into this because we are confident they will find what we have known all along that we did nothing wrong
4111014 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
4111015 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
4111016 i think its critical for the integrity of the industry
4111017 ample evidence to show that crime in the mortgage lending industry has reached record levels
4111018 were trying to do what we can to alleviate the current situation
4111019 you always wish you could do better on certain issues
4111020 we were applying the statutes as effectively as we could
4111021 there seem to be a particularly large crop of books about obama
4111022 what is he like as a family man how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock star persona that he has been able to create
4111023 this young audience all of which had grown up essentially with one president all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that i thought was galvanizing
4111024 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read
4111025 the number depends on the population and the number of households well start thursday in volusia and most of flagler but probably wont be able to start in palm coast until the weekend
4111026 most challenging year to date with regard to efforts at the state level to restrict directory publishers ability to freely deliver phone books
4111027 we have had very solid growth the last 10 years this book the 2008 09 book is the first bump in the road
4111028 i think it is more the effect of the economy the likes of which we have not seen in 10 years the housing slump has had a definite negative effect on the number of ads from plumbers and electricians people tied to the construction market
4111029 it may take a year or so to organize but if it does we will accommodate it the last thing we want to do is create ill feelings for the advertisers or the public
4111030 jesus died on the cross for our sins and that we must accept him as personal savior

4111183 proprio cos abbiamo lavorato molto bene per circa un mese giocando delle gare amichevoli che definirei toste mai contro piccole squadre con le quali avremmo potuto vincere dieci a zero abbiamo affrontato club importanti e giocando in trasferta con il benefica le condizioni non saranno diverse giochiamo in uno stadio meraviglioso davanti a forse 55mila spettatori contro una squadra forte che vuole vincere il campionato portoghese e sar la loro prima partita in casa per noi sar unoccasione importante di allenamento
4111184 eusebio per noi portoghesi il vero king lunico giocatore in portogallo ad aver giocato nel benefica ma che amato e ammirato da tutti i tifosi anche da quelli del porto o dello sporting ho ricordi di quando ero piccolino e mio padre giocava in nazionale con eusebio mio padre stato il primo portiere in portogallo a parare un rigore a eusebio eusebio nato il 25 gennaio io il 26 gennaio per me una persona speciale quella di domani sar dal punto di vista professionale unoccasione importante di crescita della squadra ma personalmente avr un significato speciale il ritorno in portogallo il trofeo dedicato a eusebio il benefica primo club nel quale sono stato allenatore per me sar un po diverso rispetto a giocare una qualsiasi amichevole
4111185 eusebio ha giocato per molti anni in nazionale e anche ora sempre vicino alla nazionale anche quando abbiamo deciso la programmazione degli incontri estivi insieme al presidente e abbiamo deciso di giocare contro il benefica anche lui si emozionato ricordando la finale della coppa dei campioni del 1965 vinta dallinter contro i portoghesi il presidente mi ha anche raccontato che ad un certo momento sua padre angelo stato vicino a portare eusebio allinter sar unemozione grande per tutti per noi portoghesi che torniamo a casa per affrontare il benfica e per il presidente che sicuramente ricorder quel momento bellissimo della storia dellinter
4111186 penso che franz beckenbauer abbia detto la stessa cosa ai giocatori del bayern monaco la scorsa settimana ma lenorme coppa in suo onore adesso a milano non troppo importante ma se potremo vincere lo faremo comunque le coppe che veramente vogliamo conquistare sono quelle che si vincono a maggio dovremo lavorare bene dieci mesi per vincerle
4111187 il benefica un club con una dimensione mondiale ma negli ultimi dieci anni ha vinto un solo campionato
4111188 s partite vere sempre per noi dal punto di vista della cultura calcistica dellesperienza di affrontare buone squadre con mentalit e stili di gioco diversi stato utilissimo peccato che tre o quattro grandi giocatori siano arrivati dalla passata stagione con infortuni gravi e quindi hanno potuto giocare un solo minuto di queste gare stiamo programmando il futuro anche per loro e quando il campionato avr una sosta dopo la prima giornata per gli impegni delle nazionali organizzeremo una partita per samuel cordoba chivu
4111189 s quasi quasi giocavo contro linter ma poi fu il valencia a passare il turno poi con il chelsea furono due partite molto toste dopo a londra abbiamo vinto in trasferta con il gol qualificazione al 91 minuto
4111190 vedremo uninter senza tanti giocatori una situazione che ci portiamo dietro dallinizio della preparazione ho detto che a monaco avevamo due squadre una in campo e una in tribuna a lisbona sar lo stesso solo che una sar in campo e laltra qui ad appiano gentile ad allenarsi con i preparatori atletici e lo staff medico cordoba materazzi samuel vieira chivu rivas adriano e dacourt ma per gli altri sar levoluzione naturale di una squadra che in questo momento ha una struttura un peccato che adriano non possa giocare perch la squadra ha lavorato molto per giocare bene contro lajax ed altrettanto bene questa settimana pensando di poter giocare con il brasiliano in attacco al fianco di ibrahimovic peccato non vedere i due calciatori insieme in una squadra che dal punto di vista dellorganizzazione difensiva sta crescendo molto bene tutto il lavoro degli ultimi 15 giorni ora lo riponiamo in un cassetto e aspettiamo che adriano possa ritornare nuovamente in gruppo la squadra comunque sta lavorando bene e abbiamo fiducia nel futuro aspettiamo le gare con roma e sampdoria sono quelle che dobbiamo giocare e vincere prima della sosta di campionato che sar per noi importante perch alla ripresa anche gli infortunati potranno essere in condizione di giocare

4111313 everyone was trying to figure out who could have done it why

4111343 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4111344 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4111345 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4111355 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4111356 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4111500 last week union leaders said they would hold off on matching the unpaid furlough days and canceled pay raises impacting the citys nonunion employees until daley comes clean about the deficit and spells out how many union jobs are at stake and how many might be saved with each unpaid day off
4111501 the source pegged the 2009 deficit at somewhere between 400 million and 450 million exceeding the figure previously disclosed by the sun times
4111502 the daley administration has tripled the number of crews assigned to shut off water to delinquent chicago customers in response to a 70 percent increase in water scofflaws over the last year
4111503 he offered no estimate on the amount of money owed
4111504 chicago has a 425 million budget gap that will require a paradigm shift in services the city provides the way they are delivered and the number of employees and agencies responsible top mayoral aides told organized labor on wednesday
4111505 in a closed door meeting with 40 union leaders mayor daleys chief of staff lori healey chief financial officer paul volpe and intergovernmental affairs director john dunn promised that redundant layers of middle management would share the burden of employee layoffs
4111506 healey promised to leave no stone unturned and solicited labors help in identifying waste and inefficiency
4111507 despite a budget deficit estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars the daley administration is giving raises for 50 politically appointed streets and sanitation ward superintendents
4111508 the move angered labor leaders who have been told by the administration that unionized city workers must make sacrifices or even face layoffs to balance city halls budget
4111509 the pay increases for the ward superintendents will be put into effect retroactively from jan 1 according to a memo sent by the mayors streets and sanitation commissioner michael picardi
4111510 if youre a senior citizen and make less than 50 000 a year barack obama has a deal for you the rest of your life free of federal income tax
4111511 sounds appealing right maybe to many seniors but tax policy experts in washington are giving it bad reviews they see it as another subsidy for senior citizens who already get federal help through social security and medicare and often have economic advantages over other demographic groups

4111514 pro bono means for the public good what rosenthal shouldve said is that huffington wants writers to work for free so she can sell ads around their work that aint the public good that aint good period

4111518 any time you are relying on a single system to do a critical task you are vulnerable if that system has problems
4111519 it is our fault for not having a replacement for the shuttle much earlier than orion will be available it puts russia in a very powerful position
4111520 it is like a monopoly position where you are at the mercy of that supplier
4111521 you dont want to be dependent on a single provider no matter who it is
4111522 you are much more reluctant to be nasty with somebody who is a sole provider of an essential service
4111523 we have other international arrangements with them that could be jeopardized by our reliance on them
4111524 everything from their foreign relations with ex soviet states to their role in economic summits
4111525 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa has no reason to believe that it will be unable to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for future iss activities
4111526 if our relationship with russia is strained who knows if russia will give us rides in the future
4111527 or if they give us rides will they charge such an exorbitant price that it becomes blackmail
4111528 the soyuz which has been flying for decades now is extremely reliable and is extremely capable
4111529 we have been partnering with the russians for decades now for space flights
4111530 this is a number that is going to make the fed very concerned
4111531 be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity
4111532 the biggest problem we have is the troika that has been set up to tear hillary down
4111533 lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people its not a republican movement or a democratic movement but a broad based movement centered on the idea that america is ready for change
4111534 this effort may bankrupt the campaign and provide little if any political advantage

4111536 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself

4111538 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
4111539 that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong
4111540 we have begun but must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4111541 preempts obamas reiteration on march 5th that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win
4111542 we cannot secure enough delegates to win we cannot overtake him the math simply doesnt work it is imperative that we provide a clear and tenable answer to the single most important question we face
4111543 but senator clinton has given howard wolfson both the responsibility and the authority to make final decisions about how this campaign delivers its message
4111544 i dont really have any thoughts on the short week mostly because i have no say in it
4111545 i just live by the schedule and go play we are excited about the trip to toronto we are going to play a regular season game up there also so it will give us a chance to get a feel for it
4111546 we have a lot of fans above the border and its good to bring them this game and its exciting for us because it is in canada you dont see that happen
4111547 i feel like a lot of the guys in the first group are anxious to get back out there
4111548 i know we only had two series last week but the shorter turnaround means were going to be out there a little bit sooner and were excited to get back up in there in toronto and playing in front of the toronto bills fans and well see what we can do
4111549 you would like to be real deep it just seems there are times where you get hit in a spot and right now thats the spot we are working through it and we will see what happens
4111550 i think it is way too early to make judgments but you have to think about things and certainly you worry about it
4111551 you would like to win every game and would like to play every play perfectly but it is hard
4111552 she battled cancer just as she battled on the tennis court
4111553 she was a competitor who worked hard to be her best she never gave up i am proud to have been her coach
4111554 she had respect for herself and others she was a doer and not a complainer she was honest polite hardworking and caring she had a quiet resolve
4111555 it will be a tribute to dena to have young girls high school athletes college women mothers and grandmothers playing the game she loved celebrating life and raising scholarship money for deserving players who have participated on the girls varsity tennis team
4111556 families across connecticut will face a heating crisis this winter
4111557 we need to come in and deal with energy issues

4111559 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4111560 there is no truth to this rumor its an old one wasnt true then or now madonna is starting her tour in a week
4111561 we tore it down at the same time of the storm there were no lights the building was falling down and shook the ground and the entire fire department came around here and some people were scared
4111562 compared to some of the hoops the city makes others jump through theyre not making this guy do anything
4111563 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4111564 it is also for the country to ensure peace and good neighbourliness in the continent and the world
4111565 we urge you all to remain calm and cooperate with the federal and state governments to ensure a smooth and memorable handing over ceremony
4111566 when you pull the petals out it has an etching of some saint mary joseph or i have even seen one of the last supper
4111567 i dont think we as county leaders should have to remind adults to take care of their children thats common sense but apparently we have too
4111568 when you can live forever for thing you live indeed
4111569 the cbcps opinion even in the past is to have a constitutional convention whose members are elected by the people secondly should there be a charter change then it should be done after 2010 the new administration should handle it
4111570 if there is no consultation no communal discernment before acting the problem will get worse there is also the possibility that the solution is the wrong solution
4111571 aber ich wollte gern zu meiner wahren liebe dem filmemachen zur ck und dazu habe ich mich entschieden
4111572 it is abhorrent to our concept of personal freedom that the process of civil contempt can be used to jail a person indefinitely possibly for life even though he or she refuses to comply with the courts order c ontinued imprisonment may reach a point where it becomes more punitive than coercive and thereby defeats the purpose of the commitment
4111573 because the state courts have repeatedly found that mr chadwick has the present ability to comply with the july 1994 state court order we cannot disturb the state courts decision that there is no federal constitutional bar to mr chadwicks indefinite confinement for civil contempt so long as he retains the ability to comply with the order requiring him to pay over the money at issue
4111574 my god if he had stolen 2 million he would have been out a couple of years ago
4111575 a dozen pleas to the county courts nine to state appeals courts nine to the pennsylvania supreme court six to the nearby federal court four to the third circuit court of appeals and two to the u s supreme court
4111576 another fundamental difference between the civil law and common law traditions occurs in enforcement proceedings civil law jurisdictions have nothing comparable to the common law notion of civil contempt of court i n the common law a person can be compelled to act or to refrain from acting by the threat of imprisonment or fine for contempt of court that is for refusing to obey a court order addressed to him or her as a person the civil law by way of contrast knows no civil contempt of court and tends to operate solely in rem this means that regardless of the type of claim one has against another person the only way one can collect the claim is by obtaining a money judgment
4111577 in all criminal prosecution the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed and to have the assistance of counsel
4111578 no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
4111579 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
4111580 when the responsibilities of lawmaker prosecutor judge jury and disciplinarian are thrust upon a judge he is obviously incapable of holding the scales of justice perfectly fair and true and reflecting impartially on the guilt or innocence of the accused he truly becomes the judge of his own cause
4111581 no person shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action or mesne or final process unless in cases of fraud
4111582 it would be no overstatement to say that the offense with the most ill defined and elastic contours in our law is now punished by the harshest procedures known to that law
4111583 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires

4111587 scholarship program he started at an eastern north carolina high school a program he once promised would be a model for the nation under an edwards presidency
4111588 we know itll be another tough game next time and its very important that we dont let them get an away goal when they come to anfield
4111589 we would certainly take it if we can get through now and go on to do what weve done in the champions league in the past
4111590 over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same
4111591 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4111592 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4111593 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4111594 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4111595 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4111596 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4111597 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4111598 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4111599 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4111600 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4111601 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4111602 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4111603 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4111604 die situation ist nicht einfach aber das m ssen wir schlucken

4111610 conservatives dont give a shit about you till you reach military age thats right conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers
4111611 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4111612 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
4111613 shes gonna bring us back and not deal with it
4111614 conservatives dont give a shit about you till you reach military age thats right conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers
4111615 this is what democrats really think of people in dire straits
4111616 the chairman of the arkansas democrat party is following in the proudest clinton tradition and getting away with murder

4111618 is the state really served by a top 20 usnwr university and what it costs to get there
4111619 usa must choose between its virtual project of georgia and real partnership with russia
4111620 we realize and everyone writes about it that georgia today is a special project of the usa we understand that the usa worries about the fate of this project
4111621 but here we have either the notion of prestige about the virtual project or partnership which requires collective actions to be taken
4111622 the us administration claims that illegal armed groups pillage the people on the outskirts of gori a town in georgia and that the russian military do not take any measures if something like that is confirmed on the outskirts of gori tskhinvali or anywhere else we will react in the most serious way
4111623 the russian armed forces and the russian peacemakers have the order from the supreme commander in chief i e the president of russia to observe all martial laws civilians must be protected against infringements of human life and dignity we will look into every message saying that it is taking place and we will not let this happen
4111624 the qualification of the speechwriters who prepared the statement surprised me again
4111625 this was an attempt of genocide on georgias part and the international tribunal must look into this issue
4111626 this is the main reason why the situation has aggravated so much this conflict can be solved only through peaceful negotiations
4111627 this process will most likely go faster now the first priority however is to start serious talks with russia even if russia is against georgias nato membership the georgian government should pursue a long term goal to convince russia that it does not threaten its security
4111628 the question of oil reserves in the caucasus and their shipments to the west was solved ten years ago
4111629 one can not expect something else from the us administration the usa has been providing financial defense political economic and moral support to georgia for almost ten years what else can they do the usa can not send their troops here because they are busy with wars in iraq and afghanistan they cannot afford another war
4111630 i exclude an opportunity for the us forces to leave the caucasian region after moscows display of power washington will strengthen its influence in the region because georgia takes an important geo strategic position even though it is a small country

4111669 tolerancia o la actitud de dejar hacer o pasar del gobierno del pld y del doctor leonel fern ndez
4111670 he tenido informaciones precisas de la visita al pa s en varias oportunidades de representantes de inteligencia y jefes militares del r gimen narco para terrorista de alvaro uribe v lez indagando sobre mis v nculos pol ticos con las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia farc y presionando a favor de la criminalizaci n de las mismas
4111671 igual me he enterado de contactos con esos mismos fines de autoridades judiciales y de inteligencia de ese pa s con esa procuradur a general de la rep blica
4111672 hace ya algunas semanas el periodista alvaro arvelo denunci en el programa radial el gobierno de la ma ana la presencia cuasi clandestina del general mario montoya jefe del ej rcito de colombia y precis que entre lo tratado por l con autoridades militares del pa s incluy mis v nculos con las farc

4111674 este repudio y esta indignaci n se potencian cuando la injerencia y la presi n que la acompa an provienen de un r gimen criminal torturador promotor del terror de estado y del para militarismo comprometido en masacres espeluznantes violador reciente de la soberan a territorial del ecuador y estrechamente asociado a los carteles de la droga y a los planes de guerra de los estados unidos en la regi n
4111675 con mi nombre con mi dignidad a toda prueba se ha estado jugando en despachos militares palaciegos y judiciales a instancias del r gimen colombiano
4111676 por eso en su condici n de m xima autoridad del ministerio p blico llamado a representar la sociedad le sugiero poner cuanto antes en conocimiento del pa s tanto los pedidos de las autoridades colombianas como la postura oficial de su despacho
4111677 reclamo por tanto claridad responsabilidad renuncia al ocultamiento y a las tratativas a la sombra del silencio de esos pasos
4111678 y lo hago porque no tengo dudas de lo que traman los padrinos pol ticos de los referidos visitantes el presidente uribe el ministro de guerra ram n santos la das colombiana la cia estadounidense y la mossad israel
4111679 el manoseado requerimiento judicial de mi persona por autoridades judiciales y gubernamentales colombianas y el subsiguiente pedido de extradici n que en casos similares est n intentando en otros pa ses es s lo una de las dos opciones contempladas desde esa conjura secreta contra mis derechos
4111680 dejar pasar del gobierno del pld y del dr leonel fern ndez
4111681 no estoy solicitando protecci n alguna a quienes no han tenido el valor de rechazar esas presiones externas y se han mostrado incapaces de asumir la defensa de un conciudadano que ha dedicado su vida a enfrentar las injusticias y a combatir todas las modalidades de delincuencia de la infamia procedente de fuentes criminales
4111682 siempre he asumido mi autoprotecci n basada en una moral sin m culas y una convicci n revolucionaria profundamente arraigada
4111683 sencillamente solicito ponerle fin a la fase secreta de esta trama seudojudicial asumiendo cada quien sus responsabilidades frente a la sociedad
4111684 i had a completely draining day doing nothing i got to the point in my nothingness where i had to come back home and lay down
4111685 now you can buy a product but rubbing alcohol and neosporin are for people who are serious about acne
4111686 thats definitely what i wear when i take a train ride

4111690 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and i ve also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
4111691 you ve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
4111692 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
4111693 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasn t closed the sale
4111694 it wasn t until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
4111695 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
4111696 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
4111697 you ve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
4111698 the conditions are ripe for either a near landslide maybe 53 percent or a landslide
4111699 futures console business is in a fanastic sic place with brilliant partnerships growing audiences and fresh media offerings from our uk and us offices
4111700 theres increased recognition and growing respect at large for video gaming and a desire to communication with our loyal readership in a media landscape obsessed with the collapse of lads mags the growth of our games portfolio is predominently sic fuelled by the same enthusiastic male audience
4111701 most of the people who hate us are people it is truly an honour to be hated by reactionary creeps with strange agendas and the daily mail
4111702 most people who know about modern pop culture know about gta and like or dislike it on its own merits
4111703 i think we are both depressed at how boring we really are and how unexciting even the worse fabrications and exaggerations are when you read about them
4111704 none of it seems very rock and roll so we find it a little sad when there are probably better stories that could be written about both us and the industry medium
4111705 no sharks groupies or pounds of coke or anything fun at all we read like angry dorks which might be true but is certainly not very exciting
4111706 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies

4111708 tom coburn is like an imam at a pig roast he sees pork everywhere and he doesnt like it
4111709 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4111710 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4111711 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
4111712 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
4111713 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
4111714 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
4111715 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
4111716 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
4111717 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
4111718 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
4111719 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with france or spain
4111720 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message as we strive to further improve our green credentials
4111721 if a tourist arrives and says he wants a parasol for 10 days we look at him in amazement and build a statue in his honor
4111722 the chinese name of the theme tune you and me is you oil and mi rice an expression of concern about this years oil and food problems
4111723 should we not be mindful of how long weve lived in a particular place in the diaspora do we really have a choice when staying too long always means losing everything which we worked so hard to build up
4111724 once mashiach comes and evil has been completely eradicated then the light of god can increase daily for everyone and the pleasure of receiving it will be tremendous sadness depression and all unfortunate states of mind will never exist again
4111725 as with many important things in life context counts for a lot when it comes to appreciating current events hence the torah tells us
4111726 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4111727 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4111728 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4111729 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4111730 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4111731 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4111732 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4111733 in the first half of this year more than 10 percent of visitors were international we hope we can gradually raise this for over the long term macau ought to develop the international market
4111734 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4111735 he wants safe passage after breaking the law he wants safe passage after violating the constitution he wants safe passage after bargaining our sovereignty
4111736 the period of oppression is over forever dictatorship has become a story of the past

4111738 irgendwie scheint alles leichter einfacher sch ner im sommer wenn es warm ist wenn die sonne scheint liegt das wirklich nur am wetter oder liegt es an uns an dem was wir machen an den perfekten tagen
4111739 the message is that being overweight is much more unhealthy for some people than others
4111740 we dont yet know what the longer term risks are of excess fat in the liver but we assume that it may then lead to scarring and what we are now talking about is nonalcoholic liver disease
4111741 its an area of tremendous concern particularly as younger people are becoming heavier and heavier and appear to be getting some of these fatty infiltrations in the liver
4111742 just because you are lean it doesnt mean you dont have cardiometabolic risk
4111743 weve tended to think that weight is a proxy for health but it may be more complicated than that if you are obese there are still things you can do to be healthy and we need to think about where you stand on the cardiometabolic risk continuum
4111744 oh merci vous mavez sauv demandez moi tout ce que vous voulez je le ferais tats unis
4111745 we were green before it was truly cool to be green
4111746 considering that senator obama arrived barely nine hours after security personnel shot and killed a rogue backhoe driver near the presidential hopefuls hotel in downtown jerusalem after the man attacked a bus and several cars with his yellow monster machine the second such road rage this month by a construction worker from east jerusalem security was efficient and brisk
4111747 e mmc nand devices are an effective solution for the needs of many consumer applications like cameras cell phones pdas and automotive infotainment systems as an example a 32gb e mmc can hold 16 000 high resolution digital photos 8 000 songs or up to 20 hours of high definition video
4111748 ultimately because micron manufactures nand we are able to capitalize on our outstanding process technology well established ip and a deep commitment to forwarding nand memory to bring products like this to market in fact we also have the capability to pair e mmc devices with low power dram in multi chip packages mcps ultimately our recent move to the 34nm process was a major accomplishment and these product lines directly benefit from that innovation

4111774 wow did you really just ask me about my sisters implants she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4111775 i got a call from my mother while i was at work telling me that my son had not come home from school
4111776 shes lying really the police have circulated information about the missing child to other police stations and have been out searching
4111777 it was just awful without him weve had him since he was a puppy and hes one of the family
4111778 we think his head may have been turned by his tv appearance but he found the streets werent paved with gold they were paved with fleas which well have to sort
4111779 rape is an appalling and perverse abuse of male power it strikes a blow at the very core of our claim to be a civilised society
4111780 it is utterly terrifying that we live in a society where women cannot walk freely in the streets
4111781 i ask you to forgive me i know that if you forgive me god would also forgive me
4111782 i dont think his apology was sincere he looked down when he apologised
4111783 i was the first victim i was moving into my house i had just started to unpack when he attacked me it was my welcome into my new home
4111784 i was attacked and violated beyond anything i could conceive or believe

4111786 the only way that they will force us into agreeing to their demand is if they take us to court and a high court demands it
4111787 the decision to expel the boy was taken by the sgb which is the highest order at the school not even the principal can reverse that
4111788 they still feel that we dismissed the boy without the proper procedures
4111789 expulsion is a legal process and for that reason we have to make sure that we follow due process very carefully

4111807 my friend jon locke creator of wicket told me recently how he feels checked unchecked exceptions should have been implemented in java its an interesting idea to kick around

4111809 i hope its ok to use this old thread for my question as its related to the topic how can my lwuit application detect whether the device its running on has a touchscreen or not using normal lcdui classes the canvas class offers methods like haspointerevents but i cant find a similar method in the lwuit framework does such a method exist or is it at least planned to be added

4111815 from the first major beat of the story that is sure to bring a tear to the revelations at the end of the movie that easily set up prequels as well as sequels this script has it all also unlike other recent superhero movies this green lantern story has science fiction elements such as visiting other planets and major space battles
4111816 theyve wanted performances that were cinematic sounding that sounded like live action and not as cartoony as some things may have been in the past
4111817 from my point of view that was a change in that they were really pushing me direction wise to sound more real
4111818 especially with iron man its a weird dichotomy because hes tony stark and hes iron man and were familiar with the character but weve never introduced the element where hes also a father that was an interesting third dimension to tony stark iron man that has never happened before thats something that they were pushing me to do to retain the angst of iron man and tony stark but soften when he was with the kids
4111819 you will go from something in this case where if you close your eyes it could be a live action movie thats the goal anyway
4111820 and on the other hand then theres something like powerpuff girls which i was on which is not remotely realistic
4111821 for rank and file voiceovers guys its the closest we do get to acting
4111822 i dont know whether it was miscommunication on my agents part or me dealing with the chaos of my life i thought i was doing ultron period
4111823 i knew it was a critical part for the movie obviously but in terms of just volume of dialogue as a robot i didnt say a whole lot my agent said they want you to fly in to do this
4111824 they think its really important for you to be there so i m like ok theyre the boss
4111825 so were sitting there in the recording session and ive already turned the script to the first ultron line which is about 40 pages into the thing
4111826 there was a major case of flop sweat all of a sudden
4111827 i hadnt read any of the lines for tony stark for most of the script im sitting here going cold oh god what do i do what did i audition with what did they like
4111828 suddenly i had to run everything he had just said me through my mind again
4111829 tony stark has never been soft and warm and fuzzy and fatherly and suddenly he is

4111863 all this creates an electoral minefield for mccain having reeds support could bolster his campaign with still skeptical evangelicals should mccain criticize reeds actions on his behalf he risks angering the evangelical voters he needs as part of the traditional republican base reeds presence also leaves mccain open to criticism since he uses his work against abramoff to boost his reputation as a reformer

4112002 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4112003 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4112004 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4112007 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4112008 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4112009 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4112010 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4112017 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
4112018 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts

4112031 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4112032 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4112033 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4112034 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4112035 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4112036 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4112037 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4112038 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4112039 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low

4112054 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
4112055 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

4112086 sci fi is our umbrella brand for casual and online gaming in the uk and other countries outside the usa science fiction and fantasy fans have a huge affinity with gaming and our relationship with bigpoint will allow us to take advantage of growing popularity of multiple players
4112087 were pleased that were working with sci fi uk on our first collaboration following our agreement with nbc universal in june there is a perfect fit between our audiences and we look forward to extending this relationship with both sci fi and nbc universal in the future
4112088 do these companies realize that they no longer have control of their messages
4112089 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4112090 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4112091 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
4112092 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4112093 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence were not going anymore
4112094 it was the south africans who invited us and paid for the tickets
4112095 it may be that russias goal is to depose mikheil saakashvili
4112096 in their view its very similar to natos action in kosovo lots of bombing some boots on the ground taking away some territories and eventually getting the president deposed
4112097 they may not get a pro russian government in georgia but maybe one thats more tolerable
4112098 it gives him a better operating space because now he can actually report substantial progress and it came at a critical point for the pressure that he was under both domestically and internationally
4112099 whatever progress and achievements made during this week may amount to nothing if a deal is not achieved soon
4112100 it has to happen soon otherwise the goodwill and limited trust may disappear
4112101 to the extent that the approach by president mbeki led to mugabe and zanu pf to get to the negotiation table then the much aligned strategy did pay off
4112102 no other country outside south africa would have been able to get mugabe to sit around a table
4112103 its hard to ascribe directly the deterioration in zimbabwe to south african non action but a more critical and vocal stance might have given the mugabe regime pause and perhaps assist to arrest the deterioration at an earlier stage
4112104 by taking this soft approach we have perhaps in many respects allowed this to continue much longer than it ever should have
4112105 they seem not to be in favour of naming and shaming
4112106 a very dangerous situation and a drawn out process for all parties
4112107 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
4112108 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them
4112109 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make

4112126 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
4112127 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved

4112135 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
4112136 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
4112137 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further

4112140 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
4112141 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
4112142 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
4112143 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
4112144 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim

4112148 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4112156 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
4112157 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
4112158 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered

4112160 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
4112161 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

4112166 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4112167 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4112168 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4112244 first of all while there are many books written on the printing of newspapers and books there is very little written on the technically and economically important subject of package printing
4112245 in the second place printing processes used for package printing differ from those used for publication and general commercial printing
4112246 installing screens ctp has rejuvenated business at brown brothers because it is so effective at turning around high quality plates at speed
4112247 it is capable of turning out 21 plates per hour but we are easily hitting our daily plate making target by producing 14 plates at a higher resolution of 190 lpi which is four times as many as we would achieve with our manual operation even when we were running at full speed and producing adequate quality before we would often have to either outsource some of our platemaking during busy times or pay employees to stay on late in order to meet our daily quota sometimes up to 30 extra hours per week but this is no longer necessary and we have dramatically reduced our costs as a result
4112248 we have been able to put an extra pair of hands in the finishing department so we are now turning our printed pages into saleable products at a faster rate
4112249 12 hours worth of work can now be done in fewer than two
4112250 our fragmented set up before the screen installation meant we used fourteen plug sockets for equipment such as light boxes and rips now we use just three one for the platerite 4300s the conveyer belt and the processor because of this we expect to reap further financial benefits from a decrease in our energy bills in the coming months
4112251 our council has been very supportive of our move to adopting a chemical free production and have awarded us grants as part of the local governments campaign to promote recycling and safe waste disposal we have also had a couple of very successful open days whereby our customers as well council members have visited us to see our new ctp operation in action such events have proved useful in helping us communicate how we are attempting to improve our service while at the same time investing in our business for the sake of the environment
4112252 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4112253 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4112254 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4112255 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4112256 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4112257 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4112258 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4112259 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer

4112325 six putative active ingredients patients openness to the mind body connection consultational empathy in depth enquiry into bodily complaints disclosure the remedy matching process homeopathic remedies
4112326 other authors have discussed the difficulties of separating out the effects of the homeopathic medicine from the consultation effects
4112327 prone to many types of bias it is regarded as weaker than experimental evidence and is generally disregarded in systematic reviews of evidence
4112328 however this type of evidence does acknowledge the homeopath i e focuses on treatment by a homeopath in contrast to the experimental evidence which focuses only on the homeopathic medicine
4112329 we emphasise that our study and the trials we examined exclusively addressed the narrow question of whether homoeopathic remedies have specific effects context effects can influence the effects of interventions and the relationship between patient and carer might be an important pathway mediating such effects practitioners of homoeopathy can form powerful alliances with their patients because patients and carers commonly share strong beliefs about the treatments effectiveness and other cultural beliefs which might be both empowering and restorative for some people therefore homoeopathy could be another tool that complements conventional medicine whereas others might see it as purposeful and antiscientific deception of patients which has no place in modern health care clearly rather than doing further placebo controlled trials of homoeopathy future research efforts should focus on the nature of context effects and on the place of homoeopathy in health care systems

4112357 we hebben in het verleden wel vaker last gehad van vossen maar eigenlijk alleen in de periode dat ze jongen krijgen april en mei nu gaat het maar door toen ik dinsdag op mn werk kwam lagen er weer twintig dode kippen in het kippenhok woensdagochtend vond ik drie dode muskenseenden die waren broeds
4112358 we willen de vossen niet doden we zoeken een diervriendelijke oplossing van de dierenbescherming hebben we een vangkooi gekregen maar vossen zijn te slim om ze op die manier te laten pakken maar hoe dan wel we zijn bezig deskundigen in te schakelen maar het is niet makkelijk
4112359 de kippen zijn een maand binnengebleven ze waren net weer een week in de ren toen de vossen weer kwamen het is lastig want als kinderboerderij wil je natuurlijk niet telkens al je dieren naar binnen doen
4112360 een kip kost 8 10 euro maar voor een koppeltje pauwen ben je zo 75 euro kwijt

4112367 en funci n de miembro de la junta directiva de ste club debo protestar en rgicamente contra tales difamaciones un club de perros falderos que lleva el bulldog franc s ni por lo mas remoto es un club especial un club de bulldog que trabaja para tres variedades s es un club especial para bulldog pero no un club especial para el bulldog franc s porque no se dedica exclusivamente a sta raza y as resulta que el ibfc es y seguir siendo el nico club especial de sta raza en alemania las afirmaciones de ese panfletario son por eso falsas y las afirmaciones falsas son seg n su declaraci n contrarias a las buenas costumbres deportivas
4112368 eso prueba dec an que los or genes de esta raza no suscitaron en francia ning n inter s digno de consideraci n y que el desarrollo de su cr a fue dejado al azar a la indiferencia e incluso al abandono
4112369 este peque o perro a pesar de lo que se ha dicho y escrito procede de nosotros los trabajadores franceses por lo tanto es a nosotros los que hemos dado origen a esta raza a los que todos los pa ses han tenido que acudir es posible que este perro haya salido de un terrier ingl s o de un bulldog ingl s o para ser mas exactos de un cruce de terrier y de bulldog lo que parece mas probable pero el bulldog franc s tal y como lo poseemos con orejas derechas y su porte gil y alegre resultado de una raza bien fijada es nuestra obra

4112388 it was slightly softer in the second half but i dont regard a 4 7 profit difference one half on the other as a troubling or worrying trend
4112389 thats what you would expect as you see capital being taken out of the system and being allocated to conservative assets as youre getting lower levels of proprietary trading activity by major banks

4112416 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in 2008 09 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
4112417 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
4112418 we are very pleased with these results given the unprecedented volatility in capital and property markets over the past 12 months
4112419 our ability to deliver 5 growth in earnings per security in this environment is testament to the strength of our business model the quality of our people and our long term strategic focus
4112420 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints

4112624 barack obama opposed the born alive infant protection act as an illinois state senator
4112625 the federal one stripped out any language that could have been used to challenge
4112626 perhaps on no other issue is keyes rhetoric against obama as harsh as on abortion
4112627 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
4112628 when applied to an individual organism of the species homo sapiens each mean he or she was completely expelled or extracted from his or her mother and after such separation breathed or showed evidence of any of the following beating of the heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached
4112629 with respect to a member of the species homo sapiens means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member at any stage of development who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
4112630 obama said that had he been in the us senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not both measures required that if a fetus survived an abortion procedure it must be considered a person backers argued it was necessary to protect a fetus if it showed signs of life after being separated from its mother the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade
4112631 official legislative documents released this week show that obama in fact presided over a committee hearing where
4112632 provide immediate medical care for any child born alive as a result of the abortion
4112633 for more than 20 years illinois law has required that when there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb with or without artificial support an abortion may only be performed if a physician believes it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother
4112634 submit serbias official draft of the resolution for a procedure before the un general assembly
4112635 a draft calls for the un general assembly to seek icj advisory opinion on a legality of the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo
4112636 they dont speak they dont talk to their audience they may say hello new york or hello las vegas in the beginning and thank you in between songs but they dont talk they dont tell stories or take the time to make a connection build a rapport theres no emotion
4112637 video really did kill the radio star after mtv came along people were seeing their favorite singers in videos and suddenly there was a certain vision of a song how it should sound how it should look

4112644 we regularly build meshes of up to 100 nodes with no performance degradation from the center versus the edge
4112645 the municipal wi fi thing failed for a couple of reasons
4112646 the first reason was that it was tough to make the business case make sense there were high expections and low funding
4112647 there are a lot of players who can play right back but im sure ill get a chance some day and hopefully i can take it
4112648 we did a bit of training and it was good to be involved especially with a new manager appointed it augurs well for the future

4112653 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4112654 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
4112655 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says expletive to me that kind of bothers me
4112656 or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the expletive and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that

4112662 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
4112663 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
4112664 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
4112665 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
4112666 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
4112667 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues

4112670 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4112671 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
4112672 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time

4112686 education we feel will be the critical factor of whether we rise to the challenge of being a globalized nation
4112687 a federal agenda for promoting student success and degree completion
4112688 college ready students student ready colleges enhancing degree completion through student empowerment and systems change
4112689 by working together we can ensure america remains a leader in the global economy
4112690 we ought to be concerned about the message we are sending to our children if we are promoting access without completion

4112718 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4112719 leave every reader with the hope that the old battle between business and the environment can reach a peaceful and constructive conclusion
4112720 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4112721 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4112722 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4112723 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4112724 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4112725 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4112726 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4112727 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4112728 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4112729 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4112730 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4112731 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4112732 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4112733 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4112734 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4112735 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4112736 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4112737 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4112738 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4112739 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4112740 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4112741 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4112742 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4112743 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4112744 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4112745 white people will be a minority in the u s by 2042 according to a new analysis from the census bureau
4112746 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4112747 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4112748 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4112749 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4112750 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4112751 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4112752 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4112753 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4112754 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4112755 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4112756 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4112757 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4112758 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4112759 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4112760 let them all in and we fight like men in tights
4112761 the number of users who visit their application over a longer time frame than just one day
4112762 the new metric will force widget developers to work differently
4112763 a daily count measures a flashy application that does one thing like show a movie preview for example a longer time frame metric will force widget developers to seek longer term engagement with their widget applications
4112764 we have no idea what youre talking about and stop speaking like that
4112765 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4112766 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4112767 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4112768 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4112769 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4112770 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4112771 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy

4112775 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4112776 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4112777 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4112778 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4112779 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4112780 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4112781 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
4112782 we were 1 2 in pool play but then we really started to play well in bracket play we didnt have a close game
4112783 most of the season we played up one or two age groups in tournaments to get our guys more experience and it paid off
4112784 we had better size than most of the teams we played in our age group
4112785 we had a good inside game and lot of good outside shooters so no one could really key on one aspect of our team i really think a lot of these guys will get some varsity time this winter
4112786 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4112787 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4112788 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4112789 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4112790 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4112791 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4112792 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4112793 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4112794 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4112795 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4112796 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4112797 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4112798 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4112799 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4112800 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4112801 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4112802 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4112803 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4112804 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4112805 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4112806 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4112807 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4112808 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4112809 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4112810 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4112811 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4112812 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well

4112820 i envy you you north americans are very lucky you are fighting the most important fight of all you live in the heart of the beast
4112821 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4112822 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4112823 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4112824 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4112825 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4112826 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4112827 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4112828 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4112829 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4112830 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4112831 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4112832 just so you all know we did set a record
4112833 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4112834 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4112835 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4112836 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4112837 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4112838 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4112839 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4112840 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4112841 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4112842 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4112843 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4112844 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4112845 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4112846 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4112847 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4112848 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4112849 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4112850 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4112851 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4112852 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4112853 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4112854 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4112855 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4112856 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4112857 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4112858 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4112859 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4112860 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4112861 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4112862 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4112863 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4112864 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4112865 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4112866 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4112867 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4112868 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4112869 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4112870 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4112871 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4112872 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4112873 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4112874 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4112875 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4112876 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4112877 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4112878 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4112879 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4112880 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4112881 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4112882 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4112883 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4112884 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4112885 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4112886 i envy you you north americans are very lucky you are fighting the most important fight of all you live in the heart of the beast

4112890 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4112891 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4112892 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4112893 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4112894 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4112895 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4112896 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4112897 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated

4112899 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

4112901 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4112902 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4112903 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4112904 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4112905 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4112906 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4112907 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4112908 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4112909 these are all small things and they all add up
4112910 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4112911 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4112912 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4112913 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4112914 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4112915 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4112916 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4112917 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4112918 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4112919 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4112920 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4112921 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4112922 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4112923 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4112924 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4112925 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4112926 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4112927 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4112928 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4112929 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4112930 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4112931 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4112932 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4112933 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4112934 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4112935 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4112936 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4112937 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4112938 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4112939 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4112940 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4112941 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4112942 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4112943 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4112944 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4112945 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4112946 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4112947 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4112948 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4112949 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4112950 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4112951 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4112952 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4112953 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4112954 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4112955 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4112956 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4112957 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4112958 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4112959 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4112960 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4112961 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4112962 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4112963 relan ar o processo democr tico no pa s e estabelec lo sobre uma base s lida e duradoura
4112964 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4112965 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4112966 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4112967 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4112968 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4112969 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4112970 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4112971 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4112972 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4112973 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4112974 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4112975 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4112976 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4112977 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4112978 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4112979 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4112980 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4112981 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4112982 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4112983 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4112986 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4112987 i had some misgivings in the past but people who have graduated from our schools have been given some good shots
4112988 the goal is to continue to provide the quality of education that st clairsville richland city schools has offered and improve on that
4112989 i also hope to be as visible as possible and interact with the students and staff to provide them the support they deserve
4112990 i hope that ive made some contribution to the children ive driven
4112991 we have been running into some problems in the last few years regarding cell phones
4112992 we are no longer allowing students to carry cell phones during school hours they must turn it off and place it in their locker or in a car if they drive
4112993 we have spent the battle of kids having cell phones stolen and them going off during teachers lectures
4112994 the building is entirely safe there is no reason of any concern after our test for there to be any doubt this building is ready to go

4112999 we have no set budget it differs from year to year depending on the number of tags we sell

4113061 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by nine oclock

4113064 al manar television has broadcast horrific anti semitism and is an intrinsic part of hezbollah a movement that has killed many jews around the world and continues to threaten further terrorism
4113065 it is appalling that a british parliamentarian should have anything whatsoever to do with this group far less that they should accept hospitality from them
4113066 has quite correctly been completely open about being the guest of al manar which is accepted as being the propaganda arm of hezbollah what she will have seen and been told will obviously have to be seen through that prism as will her own pronouncements on the issues affecting the region
4113067 im surprised claire would want to be associated with a station that airs programmes inciting hatred
4113068 there were families teenagers people of all ages making aliyah their faces expressed shock
4113069 they didnt have time to prepare they just grabbed their documents there were people with just two bags of food
4113070 he refused to leave gori wanting to protect his home and now we have no way of knowing what his situation is
4113071 we understand that people who experienced this situation will be interested to check options in israel and to join families they have here
4113072 this is an expression of the basic role of the people of israel and the state of israel as the jewish home to help jews around the world
4113073 ive had ongoing contact with a range of people in the jewish community in georgia everyone is understandably terrified and so uncertain as to the future georgian russian animosity is high and as always at times of conflict rumour and counter rumour fuels further fear and uncertainty the jewish community there is very integrated into georgian society and is no more at risk than other groups of course we worry for their safety and hear their personal cries of anguish
4113074 as we get older and as we get fatter we have more sleep apnea
4113075 not everyone with a diagnosis of sleep apnea needs cpap
4113076 weight loss avoiding alcohol and sedatives at bedtime or changing sleep position could eliminate the problem for some
4113077 to be adequately treated you have to make sure patients are adequately diagnosed
4113078 by allowing home testing perhaps medicare is opening the floodgates
4113079 its not only the right thing to do but may ultimately prove to be a cost savings
4113080 it is with deepest sadness that i retire from the practice of medicine in tallahassee
4113081 i am in good health and i love caring for patients but i can no longer afford malpractice insurance
4113082 i felt like it was something i was forced into
4113083 i have gone without a salary for the last two months i cant afford that any more
4113084 i called them and i begged and pleaded and i got 10 000 taken off that
4113085 its awful to have such a caring ob to no longer be practicing because of money
4113086 they have one of the highest medical malpractice insurance rates in the state of florida because delivering babies carries with it a lot of risk
4113087 its something we are seeing more and more especially in tallahassee and its unfortunate because we dont see a lot of female ob gyns
4113088 as the baby boom doctors retire and become consumers rather than providers of health care we predict a shortfall of 20 percent in physicians in the next 10 20 years
4113089 i dont want to see this happen in our town
4113090 so far we have seen more than 60 percent of our graduates go into primary care specialties
4113091 the reality is that your accounts at different fdic insured institutions are separately insured not added together and you may qualify for more than 100 000 in coverage at each insured bank if you own deposit accounts in different
4113092 and that coverage is separate from what is protected at any other fdic insured institution
4113093 many depositors mistakenly believe that by changing the order of social security numbers rearranging the names listed on joint accounts or substituting
4113094 these moves will have no impact on joint account coverage
4113095 historically the fdic pays insured deposits within a few days after a bank closes usually the next business day
4113096 federal law requires the fdic to pay 100 percent of the insured deposits up to the federal limit including principal and interest if your bank fails and you have deposits over the limit you may be able to recover some or in rare cases all of your uninsured funds
4113097 no the number of beneficiaries on an ira does not affect insurance coverage this misconception appears to be based on confusion with the rules for per beneficiary coverage of revocable trust accounts
4113098 well i lost a lot of weight on it back years ago but the problem comes when you have to go off it and eat on your own that was the hard part for me
4113099 i know some one that was on it and they quit because the food tasted like crap and it was too expensive
4113100 it does work but it becomes very expensive and you have got to stick with it
4113101 i did jenny craig and it really worked for me i lost about 45 lbs i thought the food was really good and besides if you find something you dont like you dont have to buy it again its expensive but it works i was doing aerobics and walking while i was doing jenny i worked the system and it worked me all the way down to a size 8
4113102 a friend did it she lost a lot of weight in a very short time a few months later on maintenance she started to gain a little a week now she is bigger than she was before jenny craig apparently that is typical the point is that it does work but it is temporary i dont know why
4113103 i had a friend who did it she worked really hard and lost some of her weight she decided in the in that the food was not worth the price she was able to learn how to make the food and do it at a reasonable price she only had about 50 lbs to lose she lost about 25 lbs on jenny craig and lost the rest on her own
4113104 from my experience their diet is more about portion control and eating several smaller meals a day instead of three huge ones they give you three small meals and snacks
4113105 i think its out of proportion to damage inflicted to what happened
4113106 but there are always other victims in cases like this and ms irizarry is also a victim she lives with this every single day
4113107 we were interested in there being a full and complete investigation in this case and not just where it involved the case today but the entire case and the entire group of people that were involved
4113108 we felt like we asked the board to do what compassionate people ought to do and that is allow victims of malpractice to personally appear before the board and testify or discuss the effect of what happened on them

4113139 wilderness press originally conceived of the top trails series as a set of hiking guides to the best trails in an area this purpose sets these volumes apart from typical hiking guides which tend to fall into two categories comprehensive guides to all trails in a region or descriptions of short day hiking opportunities in an area the idea was to give visitors to a region quick access to the best hiking and to facilitate ease of use perhaps no area of california needs a top trails guide as much as yosemite and very few authors are as qualified to write one as jeffrey schaffer this book is divided into seven chapters one for each region of the park each chapter lists 5 to 8 hikes ranging in distance from the 1 2 mile walk at bridalveil falls to a 33 mile excursion among the high sierra camps obviously some of these trails are more suitable for backpacking a feature that distinguishes this book from others in the top trails series all the great hikes are included readers will find route descriptions for half dome the tuolomne grove of sequoias my favorite grove in the park clouds rest hetch hetchy resevoir glacier point and many more in all there are 45 trails and routes described here what makes this book so good are the standard features found in other top trails guides and the expert commentary of schaffer each chapter begins with an overview of the region a trails summary page listing distance difficulty and some highlights of the trails followed by detailed trail descriptions and carefully drawn maps schaffer is one of the top cartographers in the west and his maps are second to none but in addition to these standard features schaffer also offers an extended commentary on the geology geography and plant and animal communities found in the park his theory that yosemite valleys rock walls were formed by faulting and vertical fracture planes not solely by glaciers is explained in these pages along with the evidence for it so that non specialists can easily understand what they observe as they hike this sort of expert commentary adds immeasurably to the joy of hiking that is why i strongly recommend this book by schaffer it can enhance any vacation to yosemite

4113149 adrian was close to securing 4th in monaco and i held one point for a few laps in spain but apart from that theres been no real chances
4113150 that does not bother me though because i believe in the programme as the races go on everybody makes improvements and it is almost impossible to close the gap
4113151 yeah unfortunately he has retired i was down talking to him last tuesday week and he has had to call it a day
4113152 as far as i am aware he is retiring from just football in general because as you know he has been struggling with injury over the last number of years he was really frustrated he was working hard to get back to fitness and he was just getting injured again so i can understand his frustration

4113166 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4113167 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4113168 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4113169 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4113170 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4113171 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4113172 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4113173 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4113174 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4113175 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4113176 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4113177 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4113178 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4113179 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4113180 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4113181 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4113182 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4113183 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4113184 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4113185 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4113186 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4113187 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4113188 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4113189 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4113190 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4113191 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4113192 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4113193 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4113194 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4113195 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4113196 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4113197 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4113198 who are open to doing something on the production side
4113199 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4113200 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4113201 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4113202 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4113203 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4113204 no government was ever permitted to enter a war without costing its people some of their liberties a democracy engaging in war has always lost some of its democratic rights as it engages in more and more wars it eventually comes under the command of a dictator
4113205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4113206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4113207 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4113208 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4113212 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4113213 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4113214 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4113215 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4113216 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4113217 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4113218 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4113220 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4113221 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4113222 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4113223 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4113224 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4113225 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4113226 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4113227 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4113228 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4113229 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4113230 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4113231 at capital one providing the tools to help consumers make good financial choices is important not just to business but to the economic well being of our neighbors and our communities being able to bring our
4113232 the goal is to welcome students to nicholls in a festive way
4113233 we want to provide opportunities for students to get to know each other to learn about the services and organizations at nicholls to have fun and to feel good about their choice to attend this university
4113234 but the celebration really kicks off with welcome back day slated for thursday aug 21
4113235 it will celebrate the rich and unique culture of the bayou region
4113236 there will be pop cajun and zydeco music as well as southeast
4113237 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4113238 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4113239 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4113240 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4113241 this announcement of a more than a billion dollar investment by the state is the largest investment in coastal restoration and protection projects in our states history
4113242 the projects and programs announced today are designed to complement the ongoing hurricane protection work in our state

4113244 just how lopsided is ferentzs deal during the last three years hes pocketed 10 million including a record 4 7 million in 2006 but has led the hawkeyes to just a 19 18 record
4113245 his teams have finished ranked in the top five in five of the past six years while his 2 6 million salary was lower than eight of his peers last season
4113246 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4113247 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4113248 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4113249 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4113250 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4113251 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4113252 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4113258 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4113259 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4113260 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4113261 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4113262 it was a wood frame building that was under construction so it was exposed and the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4113263 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4113264 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4113265 seer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4113266 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone
4113267 i took my car and got it away from the building went across the railroad tracks to the other side and watched my building eventually get burned up
4113268 rosie actually saw the smoke out the window and sort of started tapping on it so i looked out and saw flames sort of higher than the buildings and ran down stairs with her grab my purse
4113269 now these men can get back to doing the work they love
4113270 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
4113271 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check
4113272 once you are aware of the full record in this case i am certain that you will agree that this young man should not be in prison
4113273 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4113274 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were
4113275 it would kind of be an insult to the system to not have at least an assault conviction out of this
4113276 mike was hit three times in the chest before he reacted he left the scene of the party
4113277 i dont know what else mike could have done to avoid the situation
4113278 what the defendant failed to do however was to retreat from the house or walk away and call the police about the disturbance
4113279 because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
4113280 hes frustrated and hes bored because he cant understand why hes there for defending himself
4113281 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologize for the incident that happened at the ozone awards i hope you all dont get the wrong impression of me or my city if i knew this was going to happen at a big event such as the ozone awards first i would not have brought my mother and second i would have done everything in my power to prevent it
4113282 i am aware of how big this event was for the city of houston and the entire hip hop community please know that i had no intention of tarnishing this great opportunity nor the experiences of those who participated in it
4113283 i apologize once again for everything that happened but i cannot apologize for having to defend myself from someone bringing unexpected or un called violence to me and my family at any time
4113284 i have to take the time out to apologize to the kids and to anyone who follows and supports my career for what happened at the ozone awards this past monday night
4113285 i told myself that i was gonna do my best for the new era of the streets not to go through the experiences that i go through in life for a split second i almost entertained the little girl tactics of a person who is really irrelevant nowadays
4113286 things like this happen in life every day and i do not have the time to entertain this anymore

4113301 the goal of the church is to slowly make believers independent we as a church and pastors should focus our attention on introducing people to christ and then helping them grow to a certain point after that they should feed themselves and focus on helping the church introduce more people to christ
4113302 if a pastor looks out from his pulpit to a congregation of thousands and only half of them can feed themselves spiritually and lead others is the church truly a success

4113332 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4113333 the ethics codes of the association of health care journalists ahcj and the society of professional journalists spj call for fair and accurate reporting and editorial independence but editorial cutbacks along with pressure on hospitals to market profitable services may be eroding these standards
4113334 in several recently reported cases local hospitals have exerted editorial control by supplying pre packaged stories and other content to news organizations in some but not all cases hospitals paid for this special influence
4113335 earlier this year a maryland newspaper sold its weekly health page to a local hospital and put the hospital in charge of providing content
4113336 the arrangement was halted amid community protest after just one published issue broadcast examples include airing of hospital produced segments with hazy branding or no branding at all leading viewers to believe the local station reported the story in some cases the hospital created material is even transmitted to a station through an affiliated news network
4113337 when i was a freshman i just wanted to do the high jump and i said that id come to practice when i didnt have soccer
4113338 but then i started going to practice every day and i wanted to be more involved
4113339 i was really surprised i didnt know where that came from
4113340 he taught me a new work ethic and taught me how to train myself
4113341 he made me so much more of a technical runner how i think in track is now how i think in soccer
4113342 sarah is one of the hardest working individuals ive ever met
4113343 she gives that commitment to everything she does soccer track the classroom if shes not the best she has the attitude to become the best
4113344 sarah is very positive on the field with her teammates she and kailey striebel have taken key leadership roles on the team
4113345 its good for the girls to see someone like sarah to see whats possible
4113346 we were 1 2 in pool play but then really started to play well in bracket play we didnt have a close game
4113347 most of the season we played up one or two age groups in tournaments to get our guys more experience and it paid off
4113348 we had better size than most of the teams we played in our age group
4113349 we had a good inside game and lot of good outside shooters so no one could really key on one aspect of our team i really think a lot of these guys will get some varsity time this winter
4113350 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
4113351 in 2004 the u s wasted over 55 billion on failed and poorly run software projects
4113352 these failures can be traced to a lack of understanding of the business issues being addressed and the wrong implementation methodologies being used
4113353 at this time menlo is only accepting resumes for contract positions
4113354 abby meyers is looking at louisville pendergrass is being recruited by indiana and louisville and harvard and williams mass are recruiting annie haley
4113355 what particularly pleases me is how well weve done since bringing boys into the dbc mix with dave sutter as head coach in 06
4113356 this spring his boys pairs entry managed to qualify for the national they finished 15th but qualifying is an honor in itself
4113357 we only lose holtvogt from the team for 09 so the prospects look great
4113358 our second four of julie whitman c j sophomore from oakwood allie flinn c j sophomore from vandalia sydney lawler centerville senior laken ethan c j sophomore from dayton and julia phillips roth c j junior from oakwood finished third in the midwest championships
4113359 we started our program with 25 girls in the spring of 04 and we now have 50 girls and 15 boys whats great is that c j now offers varsity letters for rowing and it was mike raiff c j ad who was instrumental in getting that recognition for the rowers
4113360 mike researched other catholic schools regarding rowing and he met with the st xavier ad to discuss that schools lettering criteria for rowing so we owe a lot to mike
4113361 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered propped up on white pillows
4113362 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4113363 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4113364 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4113365 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4113366 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4113367 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4113368 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4113369 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4113370 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4113371 a party may preserve his or her anonymity in judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the partys need for anonymity outweighs 1 prejudice to the opposing party and 2 the publics interest in knowing the partys identity
4113372 our dad and grandfather gus hodapp were builders but during the depression there was nothing to build

4113374 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4113375 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4113376 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4113377 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4113378 the show takes place in new york city at a swanky hotel
4113379 i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that web site funnyordie and i cant wait to meet niecy
4113380 will i just be counting the minutes until i eventually die
4113381 we absolutely understand that doesnt necessarily make people feel comfortable so were going to make sure that in addition to giving parents the letter and the public health hotline that as they come back into the program on monday that we will have public health officials there
4113382 the most you can do to prevent it is the best but having already been exposed a little bit i wouldnt be worried
4113383 president bush intends to abrogate u s sovereignty to the north american union

4113387 geez do i have to theyre going to think im dumping anthrax or something
4113388 what was really weak was private consumption because of the increase in consumer prices
4113389 this effect will be less strong over the next quarter as inflation probably peaked in july but this is also a cyclical slowdown so the labor market will start to worsen
4113390 no rate cut is expected to spark the economy into life so one has to expect that euro zone business is set for a rough ride for 18 months
4113391 the market has already priced in the weak data over recent weeks this has now reached a level quite low compared to fundamentals
4113392 i knew id made a horrible call and now the state line felt like the berlin wall and there was no doubt about which side i was on
4113393 teeth are the strongest visible part of the body and therefore if they crumble decay or come loose it can imply that our very foundations seem to be crumbling it can also be seen as losing your smile emphasis on decay may show that you feel something important in your life is dying
4113394 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4113395 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4113396 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4113397 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4113398 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4113399 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4113400 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4113401 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4113402 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4113403 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4113404 alle hatten vorstrafen und begingen erneut kapitalverbrechen wie mord oder drogenhandel

4113406 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4113407 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4113408 prices will remain highly sensitive to energy price movement and dollar direction
4113409 there are many advantages to be had through the transaction with anheuser busch but in the near term there is much to cause concern execution risk is high and carlsbergs numbers should not detract from the difficulty of the environment for the big brewers
4113410 as we stand today this stock defines the classic brokers hedge of short term sell long term buy
4113411 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4113412 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4113640 prior to manufacturing the vehicle toyota incorporated esc into its design of other passenger vehicles including japanese and european versions of the lexus however defendants did not incorporate esc into the vehicle in question

4113642 horror films or scary films are hard for me to watch
4113643 i can handle one a year its like getting on a roller coaster i flinched a couple of times watching mirrors once really badly and it embarrassed me
4113644 the script hearkened back to the films i really loved like the original amityville horror and my fathers donald sutherland remake of invasion of the body snatchers the shining dont look now the changeling the exorcist
4113645 those were all films that were rooted in characters the shining was a family going on a holiday so a guy could write
4113646 i choose films or stories and then i find a character that i can fit in that carson is this guy who is really down on his luck and is at the lowest confidence level hes been at hes been suspended as a police officer and in order to keep his family together he has to take a job as a security guard all of those things could be a normal drama and its a quarter of the way into the film before that stuff starts to reveal itself
4113647 just as an exercise i tried to spend one day without seeing my own reflection
4113648 i didnt make it out the hotel door i managed to get out of the hotel walked out the door and looked straight into the window of a bus and saw my reflection
4113649 he told me kiefer offers his best impressions of ajas french accent you had the greatest first line of a movie ever and i said what was that
4113650 then i will have to remain unmarried all my life as i cant cook at all
4113651 thats a huge part of my life and i really value that to kind of not consider any of the others joel schumacher and i you want to go make that go make that thats your right to do it but if youre not going to talk to us about it to do a cameo in that would be really disrespectful to something that i thought we made at one time that i thought was special
4113652 he had a great time making it so im glad about that
4113653 i found out after the fact i think i was in romania shooting mirrors when he did it
4113654 im not really on the side of the spring breaker
4113655 the story of the movie is these prehistorical piranhas during spring break
4113656 its really about these crazy killer fish who are going to eat all these drunk kids and drunk bikini girls for me its the ultimate guilty pleasure movie
4113657 its like director joe dantes gremlins for adults theres a lot of gore its much more sexy i dont want to do something completely campy and phony i want to do something scary im walking on a fine line here because i want to have a lot of fun
4113658 i cannot say too much right now because we are really starting making the movie in time we will release designs there are many designs online that i dont know where they are coming from but they are not coming from us
4113659 its not based on the joe dante or james cameron movie at all
4113660 its a piranha movie there is absolutely nothing from those movies
4113661 it really pushed me to make this movie it gives the immersion factor more than anything else and it also gives that entertaining aspect
4113662 thats the way were going to get people back in the screening room and stop downloading movies is 3 d were going to make the movie experience such a ride that you wouldnt even want to download the movie
4113663 im working with vince pace who is not only the guy who created that great new 3 d but also best of the best diving wise and in the water director of photography he worked on all the james cameron movies and hes really an expert on the water shots i hope together we are going to achieve every challenge
4113664 the biggest repairer of appliances in the u s is going to go away
4113665 canada is going to disappear no ones going to buy a lands end jersey
4113666 at a time when consumers seem ruthlessly unsentimental about where they shop
4113667 but since oil and gas stocks have gone up three and four times its time to lighten the load
4113668 were selling what is cheap to buy what is cheaper
4113669 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
4113670 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
4113671 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
4113672 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
4113673 insiders said tsvangirai was parroting the same sentiments expressed by the united states the european union and britain
4113674 a fresh position paper titled notes on the dialogue to date which appeared to repudiate all the agreements already signed and would have set back the status of the negotiations by weeks
4113675 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4113676 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4113677 the essence of what people can expect to find in igms both the anthology and the on going e zine is good old fashioned storytelling
4113678 youre not going to find high minded literary experiments or anything else along those lines there is a place for that in the world of short fiction youre just not going to find it in
4113679 once he decided to launch this magazine he just as quickly determined that it would be an online magazine because he felt strongly that he would rather see the money go to the writers and artists than to a printing company to print out copies
4113680 i have a lot of respect for the emphasis he has always placed on paying professional rates to the creative people
4113681 theres dave farlands mooncalfe which is a wonderful variant of arthurian legend theres james maxeys to know all things that are in the earth which is a post biblical rapture story told from the perspective of an agnostic scientist who tries to perform an autopsy on an angel theres tim pratts highly imaginative dream engine which im not even sure if i should classify as sf or fantasy
4113682 very similar to that if you just look at comprehensives or independents
4113683 grade inflation continues to be a concern for businesses and with pass rates nearing 100 per cent its increasingly difficult for employers to distinguish between candidates
4113684 huh he must have heard tom cruise was in it too

4113686 in the past two weeks weve lost 15 policemen in fighting with taliban in nad ali this morning we had to withdraw from two posts
4113687 i cannot teach anybody anything i can only make them think
4113688 on the narrowest part of the track weve got an area which has been badly affected by rain and as a result the ground there is false at the present time
4113689 we have decided to review the situation tomorrow and obviously we will take into account the weather forecast and things like that
4113690 yeah unfortunately he has retired i was down talking to him last tuesday week and he has had to call it a day
4113691 as far as i am aware he is retiring from just football in general because as you know he has been struggling with injury over the last number of years he was really frustrated he was working hard to get back to fitness and he was just getting injured again so i can understand his frustration
4113692 i am very happy with what vijay said about his drivers
4113693 i think that adrian and i show strength and great team spirit
4113694 as i said before i am very happy with force india i have a contract for 2009 and never saw myself out of it
4113695 adrian was close to securing 4th in monaco and i held one point for a few laps in spain but apart from that theres been no real chances
4113696 that does not bother me though because i believe in the programme as the races go on everybody makes improvements and it is almost impossible to close the gap
4113697 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4113698 ultimately in a minority parliament to get things done you have to have the support of at least one of the other opposition parties
4113699 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation i think mr dion will have to make up his mind

4113740 vorrei che la politica italiana si appropriasse del senso di accoglienza che il presidente fini ha mostrato verso gli sportivi omosessuali riconoscendo per legge il valore sociale delle persone gay lesbiche e transessuali e un impegno di civilt che la politica italiana di destra e di sinistra deve adottare contro lomofobia e le discriminazioni per lorientamento sessuale prendendo esempio dallo sport che abbatte tutte le barriere
4113741 ci sono gi forse anche generali ma penso che sia importante che allesterno non si possa capire chi omosessuale e chi no la privacy delle persone deve essere rispettata nessuno deve essere forzato a dichiararlo se non vuole

4113954 mr mashai has no right to make such shameful remarks and is not at the position to take such responsibility
4113955 it appears that mr mashai is unaware of the fact that those who he refers to as a people are the ones occupying the homes of millions of palestinians
4113956 these people created the illegitimate zionist regime we do not recognize a country called israel let alone its people
4113957 we do not recognize a country called israel and so we cannot recognize a nation called israel
4113958 if mr mashai does not have the political awareness that the israeli people are the same people who have occupied the homes of millions of innocent and oppressed palestinians and have created the army of the zionist regime he has no right to hold such a position

4113983 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs

4113985 if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
4113986 we know people can have difficulty keeping lots of options in their head at once youre better off acknowledging those limitations and seeking out strategies that will improve your decision making
4113987 if you have a choice and its tough list the options on paper try and come up with how important each option is to you and use what franklin called his moral algebra which is about weighing things up

4113991 ser a tremendamente injusto que un planteamiento de estas caracter sticas se llevara a cabo en los t rminos en los que est y sobretodo ser a tremendamente arriesgado que el gobierno central cediera a las presiones de catalu a que est n muy relacionadas con el desarrollo que el tc tiene que hacer sobre el proyecto de estatuto que est recurrido
4113992 no puede haber un chantaje por parte de los partidos catalanes incluido el psc ni al conjunto de los espa oles ni al tc que debe fallar sobre la constitucionalidad o no del estatuto de catalu a
4113993 encierran un cierto reajuste o reforma encubierta de la constituci n
4113994 desigualdades y rompe el principio constitucional de la igualdad entre el conjunto de los espa oles
4113995 nos preocupa que un trabajador ya sea catal n del pa s vasco o extreme o salga perjudicado si el gobierno central se descapitaliza con este sistema de financiaci n y no tiene resortes para promover pol ticas igualitarias en el conjunto del estado y m s en un momento de crisis como este
4113996 los que se est n planteando por parte el ministro solbes redundar en negativo para el conjunto de los trabajadores
4113997 t rminos ideol gicos y no en t rminos territoriales
4113998 es inconcebible que los dos grandes partidos se pongan de acuerdo en asuntos como la lucha antiterrorista y no lo hagan en materia de financiaci n auton mica

4114006 the fact that stephane dion cannot commit to paying off his debts promptly shows that he is a weak leader who cant be trusted with the nations finances
4114007 commit to canadians that he will pay off all of his debts before the next election
4114008 it makes you wonder why leadership races within a political party are subject to election financing rules
4114009 when is a loan not a loan when its not paid back
4114010 lets talk about feelings until were both blue in the face
4114011 can you still take me to xyz on thursday i really cant ask anyone to take off that day
4114012 toms problem all along is that he didnt trust anybody
4114013 weve seen nothing to say the court is actually going to supervise the analysis or protect the tape theres no guarantee they wont just turn it over to the conservatives
4114014 it seems to me that the judge is taking care to protect the integrity of the tape i dont think its unreasonable for zytaruk to be guaranteed of that fact in some fashion
4114015 we have made a request to the federal government to contribute 50 per cent of the total cost of the compensation for mr truscott
4114016 i dont know weve got a timeline the request has been made and thats been standard in the past the cost of compensation has been shared between jurisdictions
4114017 if youve investigated this youll know that the criminal code under which he was convicted is federal law the rules of evidence that would have been applied theres actually rules of evidence provincially and theres rules of evidence federally the application of the law and enforcement of the law is a provincial jurisdiction so both the federal government and its laws and the provincial government and its application of the laws contributed to the failure of the system of justice
4114018 so it makes sense to me to conclude that since the whole national system of justice failed mr truscott the entire national system provincial and federal should contribute to compensation
4114019 personally i support that decision that it be born 50 50
4114020 neither was more at fault than the other thats clear
4114021 the issue of funding is not a local issue and those questions are best directed to the pmo press office
4114022 she has an impressive cv she likely will win guelph for the conservatives
4114023 the course that we are taking in terms of criminal justice reform and corrections reform is not reflective of what happens in the united states at all
4114024 once you send out a message that you are becoming serious that alone starts to have a deterring effect on those who looking at the risk reward equation in terms of getting into crime
4114025 we heard from people who are involved in the criminal community that they were having second thoughts about the illegal business they were going to conduct and using firearms at the same time
4114026 a dion government would sit down with the provincial government and engage both the government of nova scotia and nova scotia power in a constructive discussion on how to help nova scotia make the green shift and we would invest in it
4114027 siempre ser n bienvenidas las propuestas para erradicar cualquier tipo de pr ctica irregular y por supuesto los jueces nunca vamos a negarnos pero ojo que el asunto hay que mirarlo de manera integral como un fen meno que afecta no solo a la rama judicial sino a la rama ejecutiva y legislativa
4114028 lo importante no es hablar con percepciones si hay un clientelismo yo creo que lo primero que hay que hacer es mostrarnos que ese problema existe y nos muestren el dato cu les son los nombramientos cuales son las personas que est n beneficiando y si eso es producto o no de un proceso electoral
4114029 porque esos enlaces vienen desde las universidades y en el ejercicio de la profesi n
4114030 either we govern or we go to an election mr dion has a simple choice
4114031 hold a bunch of kangaroo courts or to do investigations into scandals that never occurred or try and pretend they can second guess the police in a criminal investigation
4114032 the purpose of mr dions carbon tax is to raise money for the federal government so that he can spend it
4114033 that is the only reason a politician ever put in a new tax
4114034 hes our prime minister he knows what hes talking about
4114035 barbara yaffe in her latest column states that the media was tipped off about the rcmp raid on conservative party headquarters considering the media did not show up until 2 and a half hours after the rcmp knocked on the conservatives door it must not have been a very good tip
4114036 selection criteria the weight if any to be given to all or some of those criteria the procedures to be followed in evaluating all or some of those criteria the number of applications to be processed or approved in a year
4114037 authorize s the minister to set target levels and to prioritize certain classes of pr applicants
4114038 will the last person to leave united artists turn out the lights
4114039 paula wasnt greenlighting movies so she was about to lose a lot of the money her camp is trying to say mgm screwed up they didnt she did now mgm can get ua moving on at least two movies and make sure theyre released by a certain date to keep the financing intact
4114040 a company could simply buy their way out of the problem by simply paying the tax and continuing to go forward putting carbon into the atmosphere
4114041 hes making it sound like its one or the other
4114042 disability rights advocates agree that the term retard is nothing short of hate speech the word piles insult and even possible harm on a group of people who already find it hard if not impossible to integrate into a society that values perfection above all else tropic thunder will make it much easier to cross the line of verbal abuse so often expressed toward individuals with intellectual disabilities

4114062 therefore in the present case i advise you leave these men alone let them go for if their purpose or activity is of human origin it will fail but if it is from god you will not be able to stop these men you will only find yourselves fighting against god
4114063 i was deceived and as a result i did not warn you and allowed you to be deceived
4114064 man how did i get caught up in that thing

4114101 the financial world is not just in the western hemisphere
4114102 irans call on international financing for oil and gas can easily be moved to the east from the west
4114103 this kind of pressure from the united states is nothing new
4114104 just the tactics are different the policy is the same we have learned to live without u s technology help and money how easily we have been able to find new partners
4114105 but if what we see in china india and other asian countries in terms of demand growth continues the trend will be up
4114106 it is more than expected inflation continues to surprise us and in reality it would be close to 13 percent we have seen the provisional estimates revised upwards by 50 60 basis points
4114107 the headline number is much higher than our expectation the pick up in both food and fuel is surprising though the decline in manufacturing is a comforting factor it is still early to say whether this will continue because commodity prices have been easing globally we do not expect any further repo rate hikes by the rbi but expect another 25 basis point crr hike before september 2008
4114108 i think the spike in inflation is coming from primary articles and fuel which is a bit surprising considering that international prices have been cooling off in this period
4114109 softening manufacturing prices is also a positive but i maintain that inflation should peak out by 13 percent by end august the rbi will only act if inflation hits 14 percent
4114110 the pay commission announcement has already been factored in the inflation forecasting there is a bit of a positive on that side as only 40 percent of the backlog will be implemented this year market expectations were the entire amount would be taken on this year
4114111 inflation is on the higher side and it should peak to 13 5 percent by mid december and the best case scenario is 9 5 perecnt by end march the tightening bias of the rbi should stay
4114112 everyone was thinking that pace of growth in inflation is normalising which is not warrrented by this data
4114113 domestic inflationary concerns still remain and i maintain that inflation will peak at around 13 5 to 14 percent in november december and start easing only from january and aggressive tightening in the remaining part of the fiscal year cannot be ruled out
4114114 todays clearance of the pay commission proposal will clearly fuel inflation further because they will increase the demand pull pressures in the system making the task more complex for the central bank
4114115 quantitatively it is difficult to assert how much impact this will have but the fact is it will impact inflation severely as liquidity will surge and even the debt waiver money is coming into the system in september so both these together will fuel inflation further
4114116 this weeks number reverses some stability seen in past four weeks inflation numbers august inflation numbers will continue to bear the base effect disadvantage
4114117 inflation will continue to trend higher and likely to peak by end of third quarter close to 13 5 percent monetary policy will maintain its tightening bias the sixth pay commission recommendations will add to demand pressures a fact that rbi had taken cognisance of while announcing the july measures
4114118 while a repo rate hike cannot be ruled out completely our bet is on the rbi choosing crr for further monetary tightening
4114119 inflation is on the higher side and it should peak at 13 5 percent by mid december the best case scenario is 9 5 percent by end march
4114120 the tightening bias of the reserve bank of india should stay

4114123 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while
4114124 if inflation moderates along with the commodity markets monetary policymakers will probably focus more on the housing problems and worry less about inflation that will allow the fed to hold interest rates steady into the early part of next year

4114175 if we needed to keep the child for more than 24 hours we would need to find a foster home

4114177 the kids tent will be a space for parents to leave their children with experienced volunteers as they participate in events a place for families to engage in programming related to protests and generall sic come together to participate in activities with a youthful nature
4114178 i think generally the onus is upon the parent to make sure there is a contingency plan in place if arrests do occur it is going to be chaotic and i dont believe the police have any procedure in place to take the kid into custody i think they would be left out there
4114179 if they are engaging in a more risky form of protest they would probably have a plan for their kid
4114180 the children that we are bringing mostly young teens and midteens represent the post roe v wade generation and that is why we think it is important to bring them

4114303 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4114304 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4114305 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4114306 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4114307 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4114308 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4114314 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4114315 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4114316 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4114317 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4114318 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4114319 we cant travel without passports theres no point the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this

4114336 while the hypothetical example of participating countries barring black athletes from the olympic games would have rightly caused international outrage the committee continues to allow the participation of countries that do not allow women on their olympic teams
4114337 it is embarrassing that these muslim countries have such a ban considering that most muslim countries allow women to participate saudi arabia and brunei have no excuse to exclude women other than misogyny of course and in the meantime all muslims will once again be labeled as misogynist

4114357 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4114358 i didnt expect it would be easy to win but i didnt expect this either
4114359 so what is there to be afraid of in competition

4114364 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support sen obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me

4114376 if the artist is mid career i look at what exhibitions they have scheduled for the future who they will be showing with is their work being contextualized with the works of higher valued artists whether or not critics are reviewing their works in aperture artforum etc and what curators have included them in shows and where also if museums have started to collect their work and what tastemakers do too

4114378 f or tax purposes these works of art cannot be displayed because then the collector or fund manager is deriving physical benefits from being able to view the work the irs has a big problem with that

4114391 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats

4114512 while we are pleased with our increase in revenues across all our product lines we continued to present operating and net losses as indicated in the prior quarter our efforts are currently focused on overcoming the manufacturing hurdles in our hi tex division which significantly pressure our margins in the second quarter we started to see the fruits of these efforts as demonstrated by increased production and sales in our hi tex division compared to that of the last couple of quarters we believe that this improvement will continue into the third quarter leading to increased production capacity and improved margins for the hi tex division in addition our strategy to expand our customer base was successful in the quarter we achieved first time orders from several new customers including eddie bauer the north face and wacoal thereby diversifying and growing our revenue base we expect to deliver these orders in the coming quarters
4114513 seasonally swimwear revenues are the lowest in the third quarter accordingly while we expect third quarter revenues to be below those of the second quarter due to this seasonal reduction which will result in an increased operating loss for the third quarter we are looking for overall revenues in the third quarter to be around 25 higher than those of the comparable quarter last year with year on year growth across all product lines continued growth in our revenues and improvement in margins as we further implement our operational plan should lead to an improvement in our results toward year end
4114514 on a personal note i will be leaving tefron after seven and a half years of service i will be passing the reins over to adi livneh and i wish him the best of luck in his new position i would like to thank tefrons employees and officers which are tefrons cornerstone for their dedicated contributions and efforts while we have faced a particularly challenging period over the past year the growth in our revenue levels proves our success in positioning tefron as a leading developer designer and manufacturer of high end performance apparel in accordance with our strategy with that together with the improving performance of the hi tex division i feel comfortable leaving tefron with great business potential to be realized

4114530 recreation and sports ministry undergirds every other ministry in the church
4114531 they get tired they dont eat right they have long irregular hours they begin to have physical problems because of that some of these programs can really help them

4114534 we have a stewardship to take care of what god has given us
4114535 if our body is a temple of the holy spirit and were to be stewards of our bodies the issue is not that i should be in shape to look good

4114564 ik ben ooit in camp nou geweest het voetbalstadion in barcelona vanuit de kleedkamer naar het veld is het zeker zestig meter lopen door kleine gangetjes omhoog en naar beneden geen wonder dat die spelers zo opgefokt het veld opkomen de spanning wordt lang opgebouwd

4114567 ik heb de moeder gemaild maar geen antwoord gekregen ik maak me een beetje zorgen
4114568 we hebben vaker zoiets bij de hand gehad heb je verder nog afwezigen
4114569 een broer en een zus die allebei tegelijkertijd ziek zijn dat is altijd een beetje verdacht
4114570 en een kind dat zonder bericht is weggebleven bij de speciale basisschool waar het broertje op zit heeft een oom gemeld dat de familie op de terugweg autopech in spanje heeft gekregen maar waarom belt de familie niet even met mij
4114571 maar een kind dat te laat komt begint het schooljaar heel slecht
4114572 ze zullen in elk geval een rekening van de garage moeten laten zien
4114573 ik ben op huisbezoek geweest bij een jongen die er niet was een oudere broer zei heel onwillig dat de familie eind deze week pas terug komt uit marokko
4114574 kijk een bolletje die familie is vorig jaar ook niet op tijd op school gekomen dat is toch zorgelijk dat wordt misschien een zorgmelding

4114585 i think we keep getting closer but there are still issues to work out
4114586 we hope that the legislators have the same sense of urgency that we do we need to get this done
4114587 were continuing to negotiate on all the pieces of the puzzle
4114588 until they all come together its premature to say whats in and whats out
4114589 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4114590 because if there is stability we can fight terrorism if we have a strong economy we can fight terrorism and we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4114591 pakistan is passing through a difficult phase we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4114592 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples co operation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4114593 while there are celebrations song and dance is happening violence continues in the tribal areas and the government despite the musharraf issue is under pressure to control and ultimately end the violence
4114594 the army which was his real power base cannot support him anymore because he has become a liability
4114595 also among the masses he is unpopular and has no credibility left
4114596 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
4114597 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4114598 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the u s and so it was difficult to refuse
4114599 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4114600 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4114601 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4114602 is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type in his hand anything can be a weapon
4114603 this flies in the face of everything im trying to accomplish in this city

4114605 we believe that this price represents a significant value for heelys stockholders and acceptance of this proposal is in the best interests of heelys and its stockholders

4114607 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
4114608 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
4114609 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
4114610 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
4114611 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
4114612 lots of computing capacity and storage and at low cost

4114619 its a better approach than to beg a venture capital company for money
4114620 security explorations successfully verified that suns implementation of mobile java technology used in its latest version of java wireless toolkit software is vulnerable to the discovered flaws
4114621 if a given vendor prefers to throw money for lawyers instead of spending them to improve the security of their products we cant do anything about it
4114622 nokia takes security very seriously at all phases of the mobile communications development process and is investigating the allegations made using our normal processes and comprehensive testing
4114623 nokia is committed to continuously develop its products and services offerings to ensure a positive user experience
4114624 the highlight of the games was carrying the flag round that was worth waiting three weeks for
4114625 it was a long time sitting back in the camp and watching for six days was hard but normally at major championships i have the butterfly first to sort of get myself into it
4114626 in the warm up i felt rubbish i did a couple of sprints and felt amazing so i thought it was going to be brilliant then i dived in and felt awful again
4114627 i dont have any excuses it was the same time as i did in qualification in sheffield going faster in june and doing a time that would have got me in the semis is gutting and im annoyed that im not going back out there because its what i enjoy
4114628 im not saying im going for another year four years or whatever all ive done for the last two years is kept myself in shape going to the gym twice a week swimming once a week and just enjoyed it
4114629 ive got so many other things in my life that swimming is not the be all and end all it always used to be when i was a full time swimmer
4114630 ive enjoyed it a lot more because i havent put as much pressure on myself i do when i go out there and of course i want to deliver but i realise im 15 or 17 years older than most of the people and eventually its going to catch up with me
4114631 i didnt expect to do that time at all but im really pleased
4114632 my aim was to improve on what i did at the trials and i did that so im happy i knew it was going to be a fast final so i knew i couldnt afford to ease back
4114633 i got a little bit excited at the beginning and probably didnt stick to my race plan as much as i would have hoped
4114634 i went out a little bit fast but its natural for someone like me for that to happen in an olympics
4114635 you just want to get out there and race but hopefully tomorrow i can control it a little bit more and bring it back a bit faster

4114644 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
4114645 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
4114646 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
4114647 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
4114648 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
4114649 well the frames are out of stock right now but theyre expecting a delivery in the next two weeks
4114650 well you can catch a tour of the red light district
4114651 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
4114652 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
4114653 weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4114654 these and other vision 2025 projects have been accomplished through the cooperative efforts of the city of tulsa and tulsa county
4114655 we especially want to thank the route 66 design recommendation committee for their guidance in the creation of this beautiful place
4114656 god is the only one we can turn to at this point
4114657 our leaders dont seem to be able to do anything about it the prices keep soaring and soaring
4114658 first of all weve been waiting for this game for the last two years im pretty sure im sick and tired and they are sick and tired of hearing about greece
4114659 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4114660 looked like girls who had just rummaged through their mothers makeup the associated press uncovered a report from late last year in which chinas state run news service said gymnast he kexin was 13 meaning she shouldnt have been allowed to compete in these games

4114695 venezuela vive una crisis en lo pol tico jur dico social y econ mico que socava las bases de nuestra democracia el pa s est fracturado un gobierno con legitimidad en las urnas est usando el mandato popular conferido en las elecciones de diciembre de 2006 para vulnerar derechos ciudadanos que posibiliten el acuerdo en torno a la letra de la constituci n
4114696 el gobierno usa la legislaci n como un instrumento pol tico
4114697 fueron aprobadas a espaldas del pa s sin consultarlo y porque incluyen normas que ya hab an sido rechazadas por el colectivo venezolano en el referendo aprobatorio del pasado 2 de diciembre esta decisi n del gobierno vulnera la voluntad del soberano
4114698 a punta de decretos y concentrando progresivamente poder se viene conformando un cerco legal que vulnera lo fundamental de derechos democr ticos de los ciudadanos
4114699 organizar planificar dirigir y controlar el sistema de inteligencia militar y contrainteligencia militar
4114700 en la pr ctica ello implica que el ministerio de la defensa podr adelantar labores de inteligencia y contrainteligencia sin ning n tipo de control tal como figura en el art culo 4 de la nueva ley se trata de una norma abierta desaparece la coletilla de conformidad con la ley eso es muy peligroso porque hasta el gobierno hab a convenido en la necesidad de evitar excesos cuando se invoca la seguridad del estado para justificar la intromisi n oficial en la vida privada de los ciudadanos
4114701 en ese momento el objetivo era obstaculizar las manifestaciones p blicas contra el gobierno mediante la restricci n del derecho al libre tr nsito pero la ley con la cual se regul la materia incluye sanciones que alcanzan la prisi n hasta por diez a os por ejemplo ah est el caso del general carlos alfonso mart nez
4114702 un funcionario p blico no se podr a negar a este tipo de labores so pena de perder el trabajo de esta forma el servicio militar no ser a tan voluntario

4114711 strong supporters of an emissions trading scheme because they stand to gain from trading permits and creating complex derivative markets
4114712 the european union spent five years just designing its scheme and its in the middle of seven years of phased transitions to iron out structural problems they dont actually switch to unconditional trading of permits until 2020
4114713 simply to tax the few places upstream the oil the gas the coal that puts on the price on carbon then works through the economy rather than a more complicated scheme where you monitor what thousands or even tens of thousands of individual enterprises are doing

4114734 we split the low end class into a number of segments i must admit sony ericsson is at the peak of its activity mostly in the top segments we havent even got a single monochrome display model in the whole portfolio
4114735 the same goes to the rest of solutions we are always offering more features than our competitors do
4114736 is it likely that sony ericsson phones will eventually get a dedicated audio chip planted inside the question primarily concerns the walkman line of course
4114737 we generally make use of very powerful cpus which handle multitasking with especial ease you can run several application at the same time without losing a notch in the performance rate of each individual running program thats why we see little reason in making a separate audio chip nothing of the sort is currently planned our exclusive clear audio experience technology is a huge step forward it allows to reduce the noises and beef up the basses the new technology was developed in cooperation with sony who possess an all embracing experience in designing hi fi audio products at the same time we are constantly developing service applications like shake control or trackid the latter also poses certain interest to the carrier companies offering revenues from the traffic and finally sony benefits from selling the music
4114738 as of now a 3 5 mm standard audio jack is only found in xperia x1 and in a limited number of odm low end models is there a chance we will see one in the upcoming walkman models
4114739 we have a slightly different approach to this point we offer our customers a choice by supplying an adapter in the box we offer a more flexible solution you dont have to take the phone out of the pocket while talking using a headset and the audio quality is preserved intact moreover our new products like w902 will come with a brand new kind of headset which will actually offer the possibility of plugging two pairs of micro earphones into a single jack this feature has seen some successful use in conventional music player currently we dont have any plans for integrating the 3 5 mm jacks in walkman products

4114747 the land in and around delhi is national property and it is sad that it is being given to capitalists in such a manner those doing politics for money are getting into real estate with the result that no land is now free on the national highways connecting delhi with major cities nearby

4114763 avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use reduces not only the public health threat of antibiotic resistance but also the risk of drug related adverse events in individual patients
4114764 more than one half of the estimated 100 million antibiotic prescriptions written in the community each year for respiratory tract infections may be unnecessary
4114765 decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use by even a small percentage could substantially reduce the number of patients who experience antibiotic associated adverse events

4114775 the indian olympics association and sports authority have their role to play they have played their part i am sure they can give a lot more for the indian sports and i hope that this gold medal will inspire them to work harder as well so that not just one but we come back with maybe 15 medals
4114776 theres a huge difference the difference is that every other country has a serious olympic programme unfortunately we dont until and unless we have as serious olympics programme supporting athletes right form the beginning from the grass root level we will not make progress so we have to have a serious olympics programme
4114777 as a nation we are getting more adventurous when it comes to our holidays and although its great to see new places its also very important that travellers understand the risks they face if they are going to a potentially dangerous destination foreign travel is so commonplace these days but wed urge anyone going on holiday this summer to pay attention to the government travel advice
4114778 aside from the obvious risks to safety the vast majority of travel insurers will not provide cover for areas that the government warns against visiting so travellers need to do their research thoroughly before booking an unusual destination
4114779 although the lv travel insurance policy will cover travellers if they fall ill with one of these diseases if they didnt get vaccinated many insurers will not meaning policy holders will have no medical cover and are at an increased risk of becoming seriously ill

4114783 we are really concerned that a nation who is hosting the olympics has certain moral responsibility of having good standards of human rights and freedom within its country which china doesnt have so our concern is that the nation which is holding such a big event does not meet the requirement
4114784 we have replaced the real hunger strikers with other six volunteers and they took six wrong people but today police have planned and have kept two policemen to watch the hunger strikers whether we are replacing them or not

4114789 our number one concern always has been and will remain offering the best bids reporting service for all the government contracting jobs available in nj and our entire coverage area
4114790 some large sized clients had to scale back and now can only effectively service a few counties in order to remain profitable
4114791 however many small businesses that never tried the government bidding arena before are turning to them to grow their companies these small businesses have very specific needs and often only service very limited geographic regions within new jersey nj or their other home states
4114792 id rather have 1000 small sized customers that cover only a county or two than only 50 that cover the entire state of new jersey or whatever the state may be

4114795 contrary to the department of justice allegations avalon chrystie place was designed and constructed and is operated with a view to full compliance with all accessibility codes and laws
4114796 has long been understood to satisfy the accessibility requirements of both federal and local law
4114797 we as a firm feel we have been complying with local law 58 and the accessibility standards as we understand them
4114798 from designing or constructing multifamily housing in the future that does not contain the accessibility features required by federal law
4114799 housing must be available to all americans without regard to disability
4114800 we will continue to pursue those who fail to design and construct accessible housing as required by federal law

4114822 accepting that not everyone has internet access the proposed changes to the draft strategy have actually been available online since the publication date of july 22 for people to read
4114823 despite being nearly three weeks into the governments consultation exercise too many people will not have been able to see what the secretary of states plans for nearly 33 000 new houses in south gloucestershire means for their specific part of the district
4114824 for these residents the start of the consultation period has been effectively wasted
4114825 i am still very disappointed that it is not long enough this is a very important piece of work which will shape the future of south gloucestershire for many years to come

4114920 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while

4114922 the signs for the future are not very good if you look at the confidence indicators

4114928 i cant comment for everybody but he had a couple great messages

4114931 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about
4114932 the president should come from a technology background and understand technology at a high level
4114933 it would be good if the person at the helm of the country had an appreciation of the changes taking place as we speak
4114934 i must admit im not used to direct interaction with humans she didnt respond how i thought she would she didnt want to talk about it she would have welcomed the right words bits of advice seemingly given to someone else but applicable to her situation but not a direct confrontation of what she sees as a problem she didnt tell us she was pregnant she hasnt started to show yet so you arent supposed to know that she is pregnant you frightened her until she decided you were daft

4115010 now heres something different a prog rock band with pop pretensions except that pretensions is the wrong word as the dreaming tree are a band in pursuit of diverse musical expression and are not afraid to follow the path where their creativity takes them and in chris buckler they have a versatile vocalist who by turns soars like simon le bon from duran duran but dont let that put you off and has a rare ability to intuitively find space in between some complex instrumental arrangements
4115011 it will without doubt have come to your lordships knowledge that a considerable change of climate inexplicable at present to us must have taken place in the circumpolar regions by which the severity of the cold that has for centuries past enclosed the seas in the high northern latitudes in an impenetrable barrier of ice has been during the last two years greatly abated this affords ample proof that new sources of warmth have been opened and give us leave to hope that the arctic seas may at this time be more accessible than they have been for centuries past and that discoveries may now be made in them not only interesting to the advancement of science but also to the future intercourse of mankind and the commerce of distant nations
4115012 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration

4115015 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
4115016 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4115017 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4115018 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it

4115037 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
4115038 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
4115039 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
4115040 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
4115041 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
4115042 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal

4115182 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

4115332 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

4115352 we published a special edition of the bible as a blessing for the beijing olympics
4115353 underground church clergy who work near beijing have faced restrictions on their work in the run up to the beijing 2008 olympic games
4115354 quite a number of bishops and priests near beijing and not affiliated with the government sanctioned open church have been forbidden to administer sacraments or do pastoral work since late july

4115372 we did consider very seriously the possibility of a bishops and laity anglican congress or gathering in south africa half way between the last lambeth in 1998 and this one that proved extraordinarily difficult im very open to looking for larger scale anglican gatherings on the continent where the majority of anglicans actually are
4115373 we have not resolved the differences among us but have seen the deep need to maintain relationships even in the face of significant disagreement and discomfort
4115374 we are not talking about rights for the sake of the communion we are asking for sacrifice
4115375 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
4115376 i think this is not the last anglican conference but i do think it will be the last lambeth conference

4115398 this is excellent news we are confident of attracting a big crowd for what is a very big game
4115399 this is the best draw of the round and newcastle have yet to play at the ricoh they have a good following and our supporters have given us great backing the atmosphere should be excellent

4115448 we think space and time are important because thats the kind of monkeys we are
4115449 i dont think we can today claim that we have a good story to tell how this all happens
4115450 hopes that the work will stimulate theorists to come up with new ways of explaining the spooky effect
4115451 you do not conquer countries by running up hills and firing at long distances
4115452 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
4115453 this particular technique seems so standard im a little puzzled about why everybodys stuck on this example
4115454 i really dont know how a little girl in china might respond to being told your teeth are not good enough but doesnt that happen all the time in hollywood
4115455 the people were so emotionally involved if you asked them whats the most moving episode i think the majority would tell you that moment with the little girl in red clothes now the chinese people feel they are fooled the psychological hurt is enormous
4115456 the little girl is a magnificent singer she doesnt deserve to be hidden
4115457 the only thing i care about is that my daughter will not get hurt by this shell understand when she grows up
4115458 for the first time in decades reconciliation is now genuinely possible
4115459 our position and policy on the tibet related issue is clear and persistent we should not only take into account what the dalai lama said but what he has done we need to see concrete action
4115460 you dont need to go to afghanistan to learn how to use a box cutter
4115461 and afghanistan is not a good place for flight school

4115463 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4115464 capitulation to dogma over the spirit of open inquiry leads to the very catastrophes that the unconscious proponents of dogmatism most fear thus we have the book burners of both left and right joined in common cause
4115465 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
4115466 the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
4115467 they are fantastic they are something i encourage fans to be patient with
4115468 theyll see a big difference in the first five minutes in the speed of the game the balls in play quicker
4115469 i think looking at some of the players we have at worcester it will suit the guys over here far better than it does in the super 14
4115470 i think supporters and sponsors will only see positive things the games will become a lot more open and the fans should look forward to seeing the way the game flows
4115471 my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4115475 every august 13 without fail the official cuban media celebrates fidel castros birthday by trying to come up with ever more ridiculous ways to describe the man who ruled his 11 million subjects with an iron fist for close to half a century
4115476 i notice the same attempts to associate the questionable actions of a man with something more enduring the nation
4115477 hacia d nde vamos a llegar bueno la vida est muy costosa y vamos a llegar muy lejos todo estaba supuestamente regular y los precios est n arriba y arriba cada vez m s altos vamos a llegar al hoyo

4115481 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4115482 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4115483 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4115484 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4115485 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4115486 in order for abitibibowater to continue in grand falls windsor there is going to have to be different way of doing business
4115487 there is going to have to be a change from what they have done in the past
4115488 if things are not done differently at the mill the reality will be the closure of the mill and we do not want to see that
4115489 sometimes you have to bite the bullet and do things you would normally not do under good circumstances and this is not going to be a good circumstance
4115490 the key is to figure out where we are going from here
4115491 as a town we have no say in what abitibi are going to do all we have to do is pick up the pieces of what is left
4115492 if they are going to layoff people are they going to have to modernize
4115493 usually you modernize and layoff you never do the opposite in order to get an infusion of cash into this mill it has to be seen as a viable operation by investors
4115494 we have been working very hard in going off in other directions and areas and we have been successful in doing that
4115495 we are on the right track in diversifying our economy but abitibibowater still plays a very important role in the economy of grand falls windsor and central newfoundland for anyone to think otherwise they would only be kidding themselves
4115496 plants were just ripped up and dropped and a few boxwood shrubs were actually pulled out of the ground and just dropped on the sidewalk next to the shrubbery
4115497 they made a mess of it i dont know who did this but this is really unfortunate what was done
4115498 we really appreciate what the cancer foundation provides and this garden of hope enhances not only the cancer clinic but the whole of the central newfoundland regional health centre
4115499 staff physicians visitors and the public were really dismayed when they saw this today people are shocked this would happen it may not seem like a big thing but its the symbolism of where it is and what it means to us its horrible that this would happen to the garden of hope
4115500 its the symbolism i think of what has occurred that is really unfortunate
4115501 this is outside of our cancer clinic and the garden of hope is there for the people the public contributes to the cancer foundation for the various things that are done to enhance and beautify the area
4115502 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4115503 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4115504 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4115505 we have been working hard for eight years for this medal
4115506 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4115507 i never look at the scoreboard and think thats it
4115508 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4115509 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4115510 after so many years of competition especially in the all around there is no pressure from the outside anymore
4115511 you can think about the what if what if what if
4115512 when this first started we were invited to participate but it was such a one sided conversation based solely on layoffs that we declined
4115513 why would we be involved in laying off our own people
4115514 now we are looking at another massive layoff and no investment
4115515 if they waited until may they could get the numbers without hurting anyone
4115516 after they do these layoffs they are likely to say to us them cmon guys lets link up and go out to see if we can that money
4115517 well ill be goddamned if they think we are going to go waltzing out to see danny with them under my arm after they do layoffs
4115518 the testament to that is that under these very difficult circumstances when they would much rather run this mill as a power plant we are still open
4115519 if we could put wood through the barkers and then chip that wood the residual bark at times is worth 800 barrels of bunker c to us a day at 120 a barrel
4115520 it is like going back to the turn of the century
4115521 lake taneycomo is one of the premier visitor attractions of southwest missouri and it is vital that we protect it from pollution
4115522 this lawsuit asks that any sewage generated by the subdivisions wastewater system be contained and then conveyed to another site for proper treatment
4115523 when it became obvious that ryan was having some of the same situations that kevin was facing when he was quarterback we made the decision to go back with kevin glenn
4115524 i think kevin glenn is ready to come back and be the starter hes probably going to be calling 95 per cent of the game
4115525 but if youre going to turn a corner as a football team youve got to win at least half of your close games and when you win theres a lot of positive reinforcement
4115526 immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and if so to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law
4115527 the opening of the use of infrastructure will increasecompetition and will create security and will encourage newinvestments in the communications field
4115528 the decisions are a change of the rules of the game andthey will directly affect price levels and the quality ofservices for consumers the israeli public

4115534 i know every fragrance there is but penhaligons is the first one i havent heard of
4115535 i popped a benadryl but that didnt act fast enough my chest felt constricted and the people around me started to panic
4115536 then i pulled out my inhaler and that did the trick
4115537 its hard to run to publix in the middle of the night if youre in say dakar and have a raging headache
4115538 it was more like a high school gymnasium with nearly 200 beds in it
4115539 people were screaming and crying the man lying to my right had a black leg the young girl to my left was having severe stomach pains and was screaming in agony there were no curtains to divide the beds and they were so close i could actually touch the person next to me if i wanted
4115540 tiny little nurse came over and said i give shot now i nodded and before i knew what was going on this little girl flipped me over pulled down my pants stuck the needle in my behind and flipped me back over again
4115541 given horse pill sized medicine which i had no clue what it was when the iv was finished i was given a small piece of paper and told i could go whenever i felt better
4115542 and even if they do you generally have to pay up front and then sometimes the insurance company will reimburse some of it later
4115543 if im going to tanzania i can go on there and in a few minutes someone will chime in and say hey i have a buddy there who runs a terrific clinic
4115544 i wasnt using my head i forgot there was a rural community nearby and that river was their sewer
4115545 i grabbed my wallet on the way out but they told me there was no charge
4115546 i learned of the kindness and hospitality of the chinese people

4115551 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
4115552 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
4115553 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
4115554 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
4115555 lets not get unpleasant already theres time yet for that
4115556 are you insane first you run from a cartel at the site of an explosion and then you come straight to my office what in the name of tirannor are you doing our deal was that i let you to your ways pretend you dont exist and you never contact me unless its an emergency
4115557 these new criminals you know something i dont and i want you to be generous and share
4115558 of course i wasnt if i had id be oblivious to and untroubled by the destruction of some old hall of historical records that remembers some foolish old lizards that died in some foolish old wars but as it turns out im painfully aware of and deeply disturbed by it and you argon are possibly the only other thorzon who might really feel the same way now ill ask u again what do u know about the ones who did it
4115559 they strike at random at random targets we dont understand their weapons and we cannot find any kind of motive because they have not made any demands they have not even announced a name for themselves
4115560 possibly you didnt hear me say i wasnt elected to high administration thats why youre feeding me the type of dung they love to wolf down and publish either there is a pattern or you received a tip off but either way you knew they would hit the hall
4115561 are you implying that i deliberately allowed those criminals to escape
4115562 no but you knew their target you were expecting tonights attack
4115563 your cartel old friend are not so efficient that they wud arrive at the site of an explosion so far from city walls only seconds after i did not unless they were already headed that way now i know that those perpetrators were not thorzon and you know something more now stop playing games and give me some answers
4115564 and how do u know this that they arent thorzon
4115565 his battle scars were centuries old but they still twinged the thorzons were utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of excessive violence they simply didnt know what to make of it unlike the earlier era when the great war was simply the unification of a million bloody wars into a single big one and every thorzon of reproductive age only grew so old thru their virtuosity in combat
4115566 it wud have been a much faster trip if we had flown
4115567 i wasnt about to let you carry me as if i had just hatched
4115568 i know this its not what you think hes the one who tipped us off to the hall of records bombing now sheath your cursed weapon
4115569 hraat put your weapon down both of you put your damned weapons down now
4115570 how do u know he isnt the one behind all this in the first place
4115571 because garmidian is also under attack were fighting but we know were lost i was pulled out of my unit in the middle of a battle to come help
4115572 so these creatures just randomly bombed your planet and then took a walk up to the nearest interdimentional gateway still guarded by your imperial guard i presume and took a wormhole to svaasbaklor
4115573 the imperial guard has been destroyed our gateway has been destroyed they didnt need it they had their own
4115574 is the size of a mountain it needs to be generated on stable rooted gates and takes seasons to open
4115575 is waraknabeel i am a superior guardsman of the kalamatao and i will not be spoken to like that
4115576 on the previous explosion a cartel of civil protectors happened to already be on site by coincidence and while they were unable to prevent the explosion or stop the criminals they survived the explosion they reported witnessing the group open miniature gateways and port through them these reports were not recorded or documented the last thing we need is to make the planet panic that civil protectors can no longer be trusted which is what wud happen if we report anything as outrageous as portable interdimensional gateways the cartel members were sent for thorough brainscans and brainpower appraisals
4115577 if the interdimensional gateway on garmidian was destroyed how did you get here
4115578 this was wrested in a struggle from one of the attackers the creature himself managed to port through the gateway of one of the others it is believed that he would have been destroyed anyway without the protective field the device projects during transit
4115579 a while a fair while he has been helping the administrations tech team study the properties of that little box
4115580 dismally little weve learn how to open the gateway but we still dont know how to program destinations it has one default destination preprogrammed and unalterable we suspect it may be the homebase or wherever it is that the attackers are being deployed from the whole thing is very problematic and complicated
4115581 and u dont know how ur people programmed it to send u here
4115582 we didnt it seems the being this was snatched from was headed here anyhow
4115583 well if you can get ha to begin mobilising the armies of the 7 nations i will head into the enemy homebase right away and see what i can find out about who they are and their capabilities i wont need any backup or assistance its a simple enough mission u just focus on gettingthe soldiers and necessary supplies ready and wait for my information before devising any strategies whats the matter
4115584 u said u suspect u may have located their base
4115585 but were not doing anything about the plague of creatures destroying our planet with weapons we dont undertand
4115586 its not that simple theres a delegation of ambassadors being assembled now they will be sent to find out what it is these beings are after
4115587 just like everyone else who works for ha i didnt think u were well if u invertebrates are too scared of these invaders ill go after them myself u are all all a disgrace to our history how do u open the gateway
4115588 u will do nothing of the sort u u dont know what ur talking about who ur talking about
4115589 u know u know who this enemy is from the way u spoke of it i thought it was something entirely new
4115590 well it is weve never dealt with an enemy like this before we
4115591 we opened the gateway to the default destination once only once
4115592 it opened directly into the office of the supreme ruler of the multiverses

4115627 we are focused on developing innovations to expedite the process and facilitate communication between customers and loan servicers we believe that cscs new tool has the potential to reduce the inbound call volume regarding workout status by as much as 30 percent this is critical in freeing staff to focus on the larger picture of preventing foreclosures

4115656 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4115657 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4115658 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4115659 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4115660 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4115661 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4115662 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4115663 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4115664 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives

4115672 i am in a pretty good workout regimen that i like so it inspired me to keep it up
4115673 the energy level and the way i feel now is great
4115674 with her its not i want to look good in that dress
4115675 she wanted to start moving around because she thought it would make her feel better
4115676 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
4115677 the first milfoil removal last week went well but we found enough small plants to warrant our return for another removal effort
4115678 that will happen on a day when we can coordinate diver availability and good weather
4115679 even a small fragment of this highly invasive plant is enough to create a new infestation so it is important to contain even the smallest pieces and prevent the transportation of any fragments to other water bodies
4115680 even with help from the volunteers that are coming the belgrade regional conservation alliance brca is seeking additional volunteers to assist in the full lake survey
4115681 so far we are getting a large response from people interested in volunteering but more are needed
4115682 i came back because i just wasnt ready to give up what we have here as ohio state football players
4115683 the tradition of ohio state football is obvious but once you experience it as a player it really grabs hold of you i have things here that no nfl team could give me the friendships ive made will last me a lifetime and i wasnt ready to leave my friends just yet we all made separate decisions but i think most of the guys just hated the thought of leaving at this time we all had our own reasons but that was one constant for all of us
4115684 on the field i think im the same player i would be whether i was a parent or not
4115685 i love the game of football and being a father wont change that for me off the field is a different story the best part of it is how it has helped me mature as a person knowing life is about more than just yourself as i think about it that probably has helped me become a better player on the field ive learned how important it is to take care of my responsibilities and that has probably made me a better football player my family comes first and i know i have to be mature and be accountable to them
4115686 ive already graduated from ohio state and im enrolled in a graduate program
4115687 having a college degree is tremendously important i constantly tell the young guys that football will not last forever the average nfl career lasts only a few years so you have to be prepared to go out into the world and be successful outside of football coach tressel preaches that all the time and fortunately i listened to his advice he always tells us to leave ohio state with something positive not just football memories my family is proud of the fact that i have a college degree and i am too i feel im prepared to succeed in life after football whenever that day comes around
4115688 i feel that leadership is a combination of many different things
4115689 not only is it being the guy who steps up and says what needs to be said but you need to be the guy that leads by example every single day its tremendously important to be accountable when somebody is counting on you to do your job you have to be able to do what people are counting on you to perform that incorporates a lot of what being a true leader is all about were taught about how important being a leader is from coach tressel and in fact hes the best leader we have
4115690 i think of jim tressel as a teacher first off
4115691 hes taught me so many lessons that i will remember for the rest of my life coming to ohio state is like entering grade school as a young boy but now i feel im ready to take on this world by myself coach tressel has helped me grow up into a man and i owe him so much he wants to prepare us for life and to be able to succeed in life thats what he wants and expects from his players i think the world of the man
4115692 i really think the sky is the limit for this team
4115693 i know that sounds like the ultimate sports term but i believe its true

4115704 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4115705 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4115706 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4115707 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4115708 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4115709 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4115710 the lower 15n nitrogen isotope values in the sewage sludge indicate that the nitrate in the gaza groundwater comes primarily from manure used as fertilizer
4115711 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
4115712 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4115713 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4115714 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4115715 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race
4115716 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4115717 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4115718 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4115719 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4115720 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4115721 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4115722 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4115723 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4115724 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4115725 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4115726 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4115727 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4115728 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4115729 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4115730 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4115731 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4115732 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4115733 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4115734 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4115735 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease

4115786 yet the u s response to aids in black america stands in sharp contrast to the international response to the epidemic overseas
4115787 the federal governments approach to the epidemic in black america is fundamentally flawed
4115788 the u s is more interested in fighting the war on aids in ghana than in san bernardino the number of hiv cases is soaring and local grass roots organizations are struggling against a growing tide of black migration from poor communities in los angeles county

4115791 every penny counts but when youre faced with educating generations of people stigmatized by deep seated myths about sex disease treatment and prevention 10 000 though a help is a drop in the bucket
4115792 its 100 preventable but prevention means educating and dealing with sexual issues in a practical forthright manner
4115793 stressing abstinence only is good but information about condom use and needle exchange frowned upon by the government is a vital component to outreach we need unbiased funding and focused education campaigns that battle myths about disease transmission as well as conspiracy theories that perpetuate mistrust of the medical system
4115794 we all have to do more as individuals and as a nation

4115823 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4115824 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4115825 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4115826 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4115827 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4115844 creo que mi afici n por este deporte naci conmigo desde peque o me juntaba con mis amigos en la puerta del campo de f tbol todos los domingos nos col bamos agarr ndonos de una persona adulta todos mis amigos eran del real madrid y yo por diferenciarme me hice del atleti as comenz una vida de sufrimientos pero que han sido compensados con las pocas alegr as y el buen juego de un equipo humilde como el atl tico de madrid
4115845 en los duros a os de posguerra lo que aprendimos pronto fue a trabajar me tiraba en el campo desde el lunes hasta el s bado y me tuve que buscar una persona que me guardara todos los d as el peri dico entonces fue cuando me hice amigo del kiosquero de la estaci n de tren el se or med n el domingo era cuando consegu a enterarme de todo lo que hab a pasado en el f tbol sobre todo durante toda la semana en aquellos tiempos no ten amos radios ni tantas cosas como nos sobran ahora mismo

4115862 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4115866 it started after world war ii in the 1950s with pl 480
4115867 before world war ii they didnt eat bread or milk products or meat products and their diet changed dramatically after world war ii
4115868 for instance today they are a huge importer of wheat and they eat quite a bit of bread for breakfast up until the 1950s they didnt do that likewise dairy products thats a relatively recent phenomenon and up until world war ii they didnt eat a lot of meat but thanks to some of the promotional efforts of usmef they are now a huge market for meat imports
4115869 our data for characterization rating charts provide growers with better indications of product performance for agronomic and disease traits relevant to their situation
4115870 we expose hybrids and varieties to many environmental disease and pest challenges and then evaluate how well that seed performs
4115871 managed environments are selected for specific traits to magnify differences between seed products to get the best score in extreme conditions
4115872 once trait data are collected and analyzed they are classified using a proprietary system for trait scoring a score is not assigned until there are relevant comparisons with widely grown benchmark hybrids
4115873 we continually work to refine our scoring methodologies to provide the most reliable accurate information
4115874 knowing the key characteristics of our products how well a product performs given the growing conditions and environment offers a grower the ability to choose the best hybrid or variety for each field
4115875 for example if a grower knows an area on the farm has a higher chance of brittle snap gray leaf spot or other conditions a hybrid that matches those concerns can be selected
4115876 growers need to understand their fields and environments and make a choice by prioritizing the highest areas of concerns choosing a variety or hybrid that offers the highest probability of success
4115877 every seed company offers growers trait scores but growers cannot take one companys scores and compare the scores to another company
4115878 along with selecting hybrids and varieties for agronomic scoring traits pioneer characterization charts also offer scores for special use growers will find ratings for livestock producers and ethanol processors with scores including silage tonnage fiber digestibility extractable starch content total fermentables and other relevant scores for specific end use
4115879 pioneer suggests growers consult with their sales professional and review which qualities are important to each field and make a choice based on that information
4115880 each year always brings new challenges to growers this year we have seen a very diverse growing season we suggest growers continue to make sound decisions based on their individual fields and product performance goals for the upcoming season
4115881 consistency on the front end though multiple testing and evaluation makes the data we use to determine trait scores more reliable and pioneer has the most reliable scoring systems on the market today

4115901 das war eine der ekelerregendsten szenen die ich jemals erlebt habe
4115902 direkt gegen die streitkr fte und den prozess der nationalen vers hnung gerichtet
4115903 i think canadian blood services is the right agency to really absorb this national thing we do need a national agency one way or the other
4115904 it may not be perfect but if you look at the face of it it certainly expands your pools of potential donors and thats extremely important
4115905 talking beats not talking lets put it this way and were looking at the integrity of these databases and thats extremely important we like to think people have a very common concern with lack of organ donation in this country and we can do something about it if we put our minds and hearts into it
4115906 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4115907 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
4115908 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
4115909 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
4115910 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
4115911 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
4115912 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are for all intents and purposes because of some timing they are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
4115913 theres no doubt that general motors realized the importance of positive media coverage with the prius

4115916 thats always tough for us to get past let people know that its more than whoa man and snapping fingers and berets and whatever it is associated with what my friend john calls the p word because poetry can scare off some people but i like to think that spoken word is that umbrella artform that allows a whole bunch of genres to be included
4115917 people can post news articles as they see fit the community decides what articles go on the front page by voting the little twist we have is that people can make money off of this those citizen journalists who contribute really popular articles with a lot of comments get a share of our ad revenue every month
4115918 a lot of people think its a little weird to put that into a book but ive always thought the best spoken word is still very well written and can come alive on the page
4115919 one of my main goals is to get spoken word into schools not only through us getting gigs in schools but getting a book so english classes can have good curriculum on spoken word
4115920 this dupont stretch was in such need of a good coffee shop theres not even a big box like starbucks or second cup on dupont you got to go to vesta at bathurst to get a decent cup of coffee but im glad ezras pound came along to give us writers a place to go and hang out and have a really stunning cup of coffee

4115924 the divide between good and evil black and white heaven and hell dusk and dawn or even an everyday juxtaposition it is an exploration that unites cultural historical and community boundaries it is the elements that have helped shape ones own life and the way it ties lives together bringing life from the past to the present and into the future combining fashion with art gives you the designer the chance to create a personal realm that tells your tale and communicates it back to the public you will be required to explore what lies between your own lines and bring your personal expression to life through your themed collection and presentation

4115927 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
4115928 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him

4115933 it will not be shown live on the west coast
4115934 this is a baseless rumor and i dont know the genesis of it

4115937 usually people that consolidate are close to bankruptcy and are trying to push their debt further out as long as they can
4115938 you have to consider whether you are willing to pay less now but for a longer period of time
4115939 debt consolidation is always a good idea on paper you are presumably taking higher interest credit card debt and rolling it into a lower interest loan so instead of paying many different debts each month you are paying one
4115940 in practice unless you are a very disciplined person debt consolidation isnt going to work
4115941 we see the most well meaning people trying to be financially savvy and roll all their bills into a debt consolidation loan
4115942 if someone has five credit card debts and they consolidate it into a home equity line of credit that is a no no
4115943 people should look at the fine print on the new card theyre transferring to to make sure they understand all the terms says lee driscoll
4115944 a lot of times they will find its not as easy as simply having no finance charge
4115945 credit is only being extended to those who are truly credit worthy
4115946 in todays environment you will have to have very good credit to take out that loan and youll have to put up some collateral

4115970 getting an email out of the blue from mark mann offering support has really turned around this years event for me without his sponsorship i would be in a very different situation to be honest i dont know how i would have got here
4115971 it looked like it might be touch and go whether maria would be in a position to compete in the forthcoming manx gp following a rather difficult start to the 2008 season involving injury and machinery problems we felt that given marias standing in the road racing world this would detract from the event and were therefore delighted when maria accepted our offer of support we would therefore like to wish maria every success in the manx gp and hope that the sponsorship we have provided helps her to maintain her record as the fastest woman around the tt course

4115977 if you continue to deny resources for editorial you inevitably produce worse products and why would businesses advertise in or readers buy such products
4115978 the strategy of cut cut cut in editorial budgets has been shown to be a failure and its time it was reversed shareholders should be fearful for their investments and local communities should fear for the future of their papers
4115979 we wont sit back and allow jobs and quality journalism to be threatened the mood amongst our members is one of determination to actively oppose cuts which damage quality lead to increased workloads threaten the future of the titles and put at risk more jobs

4115981 most other journalism programmes require students to focus on print or broadcast journalism
4115982 but the ba in multimedia journalism gives students the chance to build a much broader skillset developing professional skills in print radio television and online journalism in all three years of the programme
4115983 this responds to the way the profession is moving and gives graduates greater flexibility when applying for jobs
4115984 the programme will also develop students critical thinking and academic skills and provides a valuable foundation for other media professions from public relations to advertising as well as a wide range of traditional graduate level jobs
4115985 the course has proved extremely useful in helping centres recruit and develop people with limited or no previous experience of subbing and equipping them with the skills and knowledge to take on more demanding production roles earlier than they might have done otherwise

4116003 barack obama remains opposed to new offshore drilling although he now says he would accept a highly restricted version as part of a comprehensive package just recently he claimed that if only americans would inflate their tires properly and get regular tune ups we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling this is bizarre by any reasonable calculation of annual tire inflation and tune up savings the outer continental shelf holds nearly a hundred times as much oil as for oil shale also under federal moratorium after a thousand years of driving with obama inflated tires and obama tuned engines we would still have saved only one fifth the oil shale available in the united states
4116004 its always good to take a break from the madding crowd but especially now that american politics has surpassed itself in self mockery after four days avoiding television blogs youtube and cell phones it is possible to wonder how we get so exercised about the insignificant not that politics isnt important the debate about what role government should play in our lives is no small thing and while we cant all kick back at once and hope that our enemies work out their anger issues a little perspective is salutary and productive in a fallow field kind of way the family is what gives our life meaning and makes our nation strong the family is also what keeps government at a respectful distance working for us and not the other way around all our political choices should be made in the service of that understanding thats all and weve got work to do
4116005 mapping america a project cataloguing the societal effects of the family and church has found that adolescents from broken homes are much more likely to use hard drugs according to data from the national longitudinal sample of adolescent health of adolescents who live with married or cohabiting parents or with an always single parent up to 11 have used hard drugs when their living environment has been disrupted however that number shoots up 15 for adolescents living with divorcees 18 for those in stepfamilies and 19 for those living with one biological parent in a cohabiting relationship divorce and parental separation increase both the likelihood of trying drugs and the amount of drug addiction and intravenous use according to the centers for disease control and prevention fourteen year olds of divorced parents are nearly four times more likely to try illegal drugs and twice as likely to use them as adults what can be done sometimes not always but sometimes complex problems can be addressed with simple solutions in the case of teenager and pre teenager drug abuse a little bit of faith can go a long way
4116006 i have always believed that america is strongest and freest and happiest when it is truest to the wisdom of its founders in federalist 45 james madison wrote that the powers delegated by the constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state government are numerous and indefinite or to put it another way we the people as long as we remember these words we the people and make them our guide so long as we remember that america has always drawn its inspiration from the people and has always been governed best when governed most by those governments closest to the people america will remain strong and free the envy of the world
4116007 edgar k browning professor of economics at texas a amp m university has a new book aptly titled stealing from each other its subtitle how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit goes to the heart of what the book is about the rise of equalitarian ideology has driven americans to steal from one another browning explains that certain kinds of equality have been a cherished value in america equality under the law and within reason equality of opportunity is consistent with a free society equality of results is an anathema to a free society and within it lie the seeds of tyranny browning reminds us of the biblical admonition thou shalt not steal government income redistribution programs produce the same result as theft in fact thats what a thief does he redistributes income the difference between government and thievery is mostly a matter of legality brownings solution is captured in the title of his last chapter just say no where he proposes the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans he agrees with james madison the father of our constitution who said i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
4116008 it is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf

4116014 heres the record when it comes to georgia obama on learning of the soviet invasion played it cool it was important for all sides to show restraint mccain by contrast demanded that russia immediately and unconditionally pull its forces out of georgia mccain understood the stakes in the affair does obama understand
4116015 georgia whose desire for nato membership had u s support is not in nato because some prospective members of mccains league of democracies e g germany thought that starting membership talks with georgia would complicate the project of propitiating russia nato is scheduled to review the question of georgias membership in december if georgia were in nato would nato now be at war with russia more likely russia would not be in georgia
4116016 truthfully an obama presidency should scare the pants off 70 percent of americans across the board obama is dramatically out of sync with this center right nation obamas entire campaign theme is fraudulent how can a man unite america when his views are so far out of line with average americans for whom he has revealed unbridled contempt how can he inspire america when he advertises his disdain for what he believes america has become

4116022 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
4116023 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws

4116039 over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same

4116057 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season
4116058 the plan was to perhaps take him on loan for six months and see how he did but no decision has been made yet we will look at the situation again after the game against rangers at the weekend
4116059 the result against motherwell has given us something to build on and we must keep working hard together to achieve results
4116060 we have really got to be concentrating on ourselves regardless of what rangers are doing or what is happening in the stands
4116061 what they understand is action the question now is whether the u s and other western nations will be willing to take serious action against this outrageous russian aggression
4116062 it is also important to give georgia the wherewithal to defend itself
4116063 if russia doesnt call off its offensive right away the pentagon should rush deliveries of javelins and stingers to georgia
4116064 on iran for instance russia has been more hindrance than help it has helped iran to develop its nuclear program and it has been selling iran high tech surface to air missiles russia has gone along grudgingly with weak sanctions at the un but along with china it has blocked more robust action if russia delivers important aid in the war on terrorism or other areas im not aware of it increasingly the russians have adopted a confrontational tone with the west and they have backed it up with bullying of our allies the bush administration and other western governments have tried their best to get along with russia that has been interpreted by putin not as a sign of goodwill but as a sign of weakness it is time to send a different message by making clear that russia has crossed a red line in georgia

4116066 the players will just have to accept what happened here and we mustnt lose sight of our future objectives the next step for them is the full national team and theres no doubt in my mind that weve gained an awful lot in terms of experience in this tournament
4116067 its a shame we couldnt bring some joy to the honduran people but you have to understand that we can learn a lot from this for the future
4116068 im getting on so for me playing in the olympics is just something i can be proud of for them though its another benchmark in their personal development and theyll get the benefit of it in the future
4116069 after striking the vehicle the suspect made another u turn striking a pedestrian who was crossing the street
4116070 the suspect vehicle then came to rest after wrecking out into a fence at the location

4116072 he hasnt been found guilty of anything we have to stop trashing the constitution
4116073 he has been found guilty of violating his bond by two judges
4116074 im very happy we found a judge who understands the constitution of the united states
4116075 he is extremely skeptical of anything defendants and defense lawyers say to him but the mayor probably is immune from this kind of treatment because he is well represented and judge townsend is performing only a brief duty in front of television cameras
4116076 its interesting that we should draw a visiting judge in this case and its a judge with a reputation
4116077 the defense could request a bond reduction or the prosecution might very well say because he violated travel going to the water park in niagara falls canada with his sons on july 21 the judge could increase his bond
4116078 i just dont think the prosecutor will bring up the violations
4116079 at this point it could look like she is beating a guy who is down the bond is already pretty restrictive and even if the prosecutor brings up the questions about extra personal travel i dont think a new judge would jail him
4116080 the underlying problem is that american drivers have no sense of lane disclipine

4116082 the footage of a wounded cpl abeto asking for help was very short and was handled as delicately as possible the video was aired because this was precisely the point of the story the need for our armed forces to improve its medical evacuation capability
4116083 as a news organization we see it as our responsibility to tackle possible shortcomings in the hope that authorities will respond and correct them
4116084 the subject matter was treated sensitively and responsibly throughout the report
4116085 in the interest of responsibility we periodically review the way we conduct our news coverage and take action accordingly we take our responsibility seriously
4116086 walang gustong mangyari ito kaya kahit paano ay binibigay namin lahat ng suporta sa pamilya para naman sila makaadjust

4116099 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
4116100 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
4116101 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
4116102 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
4116103 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
4116104 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
4116105 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
4116106 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4116107 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4116112 i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that web site funnyordie and i cant wait to meet niecy
4116113 after all these wonderful years i didnt want to go out like this but we needed to play at our absolute best and they didnt allow us
4116114 i really thought we could do it but their serve was awesome and we couldnt get on top of it
4116115 its so hard im going to miss the olympics the games to me are the ultimate theres always something so special about them
4116116 my family and boyfriend are here supporting us and its a shame that we cant go on but looking back im so proud of what weve achieved im just very emotionally
4116117 i dont know what im going to do now i wanted to see what happened here before deciding on the future
4116118 im proud that we got ourselves to this tournament because were not spring chickens anymore
4116119 after the first round victory i really thought we could go on and get gold and i could retire maybe that took a lot out of us emotionally
4116120 ill need six to eight weeks now to sit down and think things through its going to be very difficult because gail has pretty much been my partner since we were in our teens
4116121 it will be very difficult to replace her if at all shes a fantastic person and a great ambassador for the sport and gb sport in general
4116122 we didnt quite reach the pinnacle in the olympics but weve done everything else we wanted to achieve its been an amazing rollercoaster ride together
4116123 it would be great to be involved in london 2102 in some way
4116124 on the court would be the best possible option and it hasnt ended for gail and i either were going to be the best of friends for the rest of our lives

4116129 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4116130 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4116131 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4116132 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4116133 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4116134 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4116135 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4116136 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4116137 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4116138 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4116139 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4116140 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4116141 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4116142 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4116143 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4116144 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4116145 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4116146 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4116147 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4116148 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4116149 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4116150 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4116151 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4116152 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4116153 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4116154 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4116155 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4116156 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4116157 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4116158 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4116159 let me tell you something hope is a dangerous thing it can drive a man insane
4116160 we are pumping gas again into the south caucasus pipeline
4116161 the baku supsa pipeline remains suspended for the time being it goes through the middle of the country
4116162 its a different route from scp so were still assessing the security implications and that remains suspended
4116163 while the conflict in georgia may have been the main source of attention for us the most significant supply event was the attack on the btc line in turkey and the implication that it may continue to be a target and one the length of which makes it virtually impossible to defend comfortably
4116164 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
4116165 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4116166 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4116167 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4116168 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4116169 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4116170 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4116171 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4116172 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4116173 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4116174 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4116175 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4116176 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4116177 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4116178 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4116179 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4116180 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4116181 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4116182 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4116183 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4116184 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4116185 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4116186 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4116187 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4116188 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4116189 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4116190 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4116191 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4116192 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4116193 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4116194 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4116195 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4116196 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4116197 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4116198 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4116199 any regulation of carbon dioxide is going to be controversial because its going to raise energy costs
4116200 with permits you can trade with a wide variety of entities to achieve the lowest cost solution
4116201 some people say taxes are better because an uncertain price hurts firms
4116202 their argument is that if a firm doesnt know what the price is going to be its harder for the firm to make decisions regarding capital investments and r amp d
4116203 firms deal with uncertainty all the time they buy inputs that have volatile prices
4116204 electric utilities for example face uncertain coal prices they use financial instruments to deal with that uncertainty
4116205 initially the permits may be thinly traded because people are trying to figure out what the right price is
4116206 power plants participating in the program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions 22 percent 7 3 million tons below mandated levels
4116207 probably the greatest green success story of the last decade
4116208 you couldnt just take the sulfur dioxide program and plop it down for greenhouses gases but i thought it would work well for a variety of reasons
4116209 something like 70 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions came from electric utilities
4116210 there were other sources too but congress decided that itd get a big chunk of the emissions from regulating the utilities and that it was going to let the other 30 percent go thatll happen with carbon dioxide well look for the big chunks that we can get in the lowest cost way
4116211 so theres a great legal environment to enforce the property rights associated with tradable permits and there are enforcement bodies that can litigate to ensure compliance
4116212 so to solve the issue you need a global program and theres no uniform regulatory body that governs the world
4116213 the thing to keep in mind is that you can create a demand for products that cost more but have environmental benefits attached to them

4116231 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
4116232 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4116233 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4116234 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4116235 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4116236 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4116237 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4116238 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4116239 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4116240 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie

4116261 les olympiques manquent mais ils vont acqu rir de lexp rience en chine et je ne vais donc pas men plaindre
4116262 mais il y a forc ment peu de jeunes dans ma s lection puisque les meilleurs sont aux jeux jai donc privili gi lexp rience et profit de loccasion pour faire savoir certains que je ne les ai pas oubli s ce nest pas parce quon na pas t repris deux ou trois fois de suite quon est d finitivement ray des cadres je compte ainsi redonner une chance certains joueurs qui navaient plus eu loccasion de me d montrer leur utilit depuis pas mal de temps buffel daems vandenbergh ndlr il na pas t possible de scouter tout le monde mais on a multipli les contacts aucun joueur de cette s lection nest en condition insuffisante mais il y en a qui ont tr s peu jou c tait dailleurs in vitable ce stade de la saison
4116263 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies
4116264 you are allowed to practice medicine if you provide such services for free
4116265 tom coburn is like an imam at a pig roast he sees pork everywhere and he doesnt like it
4116266 the work of the ethics committee is confidential and we cannot comment on matters that may be before it
4116267 no one has ever chosen to have dr coburn deliver her baby in order to sway his vote
4116268 we are convinced that there should be a group working to oppose a war or attack or invasion of iran
4116269 we would love for the ucc to take leadership in building this movement
4116270 as christians we just cannot allow ourselves to be part of any attack or invasion by our government
4116271 is that the governments of our two countries are not necessarily where the people of our two countries are the iranian people we met were eager to know us eager to open their lives to us eager to find out who we are and eager to be friends
4116272 before the beginning of the iraq war u s churches fell down on the job
4116273 this time if we dont get ahead of this issue of waging war if we allow war to happen without severe severe protests we in the church will lose all kinds of moral authority
4116274 wisdom and understanding and an absence of blame for the horrendous things iran has gone through since the us was engaged in a covert cia operation to overthrow their democratically elected government under the leadership of president mosaddeq in 1953
4116275 we must work to recognize that the current conflict between our governments should not trump our human ability to care for each other and to see past the stereotypes and generalizations that we are too often presented with in the lead up to war
4116276 the stylish tunics on young women the way they wore their scarves we were amazed at the fashion of young men we saw our first gas station and the cars lined up waiting to fill up with their weekly ration of fuel
4116277 the bush administration is playing a tragic role bringing war and hatred
4116278 these people have suffered hugely from government policies and the iran iraq war
4116279 we know peoples cell phones are tapped and their internet usage watched that arrests are arbitrary and the prison horrendous that talking too much is costly
4116280 appears to be doing well worships freely and sponsors six day schools with a population of five hundred children attending
4116281 many people a desire for more freedom and it has been difficult to wear hijab and at the same time i am finding iran a very vibrant and sophisticated society composed of people who want to be seen as human beings able to determine their own future
4116282 i am deeply concerned that senator clinton a national political figure discussed the prospect of military action against iran and even stated we would be able to totally obliterate them
4116283 this is a time for finding common ground between our two nations not threats when our elected leaders choose belligerent rhetoric over dialogue it is up to us as everyday americans to serve as civilian diplomats
4116284 distinguished history of successful behind the scenes friendship and solidarity delegations to regions in political conflict
4116285 after three months of recovery gianni had a polyp on his left vocal chord were finally back and ready to rock the next show will take place next friday at the legendary moosfestival in walkringen switzeland together with such great bands like switzerlands finest zuri west volt and skansis
4116286 we always have a great time playing in nyc from our first show in the city at the late great cbgbs and ever since this will certainly be no exception
4116287 i am pleased to join the thousands of americans including athletes coaches and parents and olympic greats who are calling for an end to title ixs gender quota system that has devastated so many of our collegiate sports programs
4116288 no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance
4116289 as we watch our athletes compete in the olympic games in beijing we can be proud not only of their tremendous athletic performances but also of the uniquely american collegiate sports system that developed many of our olympic competitors it is a tragedy to see so many collegiate mens teams that have produced olympians for the us eliminated like ucla gymnastics and swimming university of miami diving and fresno state wrestling
4116290 title ix reform is a big issue in the state of georgia there are tens of thousands of school age wrestlers in congressman barrs home state but not a single ncaa wrestling program in this case the gender quota advocates in washington dc who have fought all reasonable measures to reform title ixs proportionality standard are blocking the legitimate interests of the tax paying parents in georgia if the states schools were simply allowed to use online surveys to measure actual interest they would be able to add wrestling programs without fear of running afoul of the law
4116291 we should probably go ahead and strip all assumptions out of how
4116292 when dealing with the insane the best method is to pretend to be sane
4116293 theres no system foolproof enough to defeat a sufficiently great fool
4116294 theres no system foolproof enough to defeat a sufficiently great fool
4116295 the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit
4116296 it is curious but not surprising how the bush administration and its allies have now found renewed respect for international law in the caucasus but not when it comes to 1 the united states invading afghanistan and iraq while threatening to attack iran 2 israel invading lebanon and palestine attacking syria and threatening to attack iran 3 ethiopia invading somalia 4 colombia attacking ecuador etc from an international law perspective the real issue here is whether during her trip to tbilisi a month ago u s secretary of state rice gave the proverbial green light to georgia to attack south ossetia and thus deliberately provoke an overreaction by russia and how does this fit in with the u s u k naval armada currently steaming for the persian gulf and possible military confrontation with iran over its right to engage in nuclear enrichment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty
4116297 do you prefer more drilling or more investment in alternative energy
4116298 it remains unclear what mix of remedies the public actually wants
4116299 built on false premises a pipe dream held out to a desperate and cash strapped public
4116300 is unlikely to have a near term practical impact on oil flow though it could have a psychological one on trading
4116301 the stone age didnt end because we ran out of stones
4116302 projections in the ocs outer continental shelf access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
4116303 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
4116304 oil prices are set based on the balance of worldwide supply and worldwide demand that means that additional production of oil in the united states has effectively no more benefit to u s consumers than production in any other part of the world
4116305 due to government mismanagement and internal conflicts mexico venezuela nigeria iran and iraq for instance have seen oil production drop
4116306 concerns about transfer pricing abuse have led researchers to compare the tax liabilities of foreign and u s controlled corporations transfer prices are the prices related companies charge on intercompany transactions however such comparisons are complicated because other factors may explain the differences in reported tax liabilities in three prior reports gao found differences in the percentages of foreign controlled and u s controlled corporations reporting no tax liability gao was asked to update the previous reports by comparing 1 the tax liabilities of foreign controlled domestic corporations fcdc and u s controlled corporations uscc including those reporting zero tax liabilities for 1998 through 2005 the latest available data and 2 characteristics of fcdcs and usccs such as age size and industry gao analyzed data from the internal revenue services statistics of income samples of corporate tax returns gao does not make any recommendations in this report in commenting on a draft of this report irs provided comments on technical issues which we incorporated into this report where appropriate
4116307 its red just like my bike its my favorite color
4116308 a woman writing about nascar i gotta look into this
4116309 para un proceso normal de recuperaci n tenemos que calcular cuatro semanas
4116310 nuestro plantel es amplio tenemos otros delanteros y para ellos es una oportunidad
4116311 comence muy bien pero los golpes que me coloc en la zona intermedia que normalmente asimilo bien esta vez me hicieron mucho da o y me dejaron sin opci n al triunfo
4116312 la verdad no pude reaccionar me disminuy mi condici n f sica y ah se acab la pelea
4116313 ahora lo que cuenta es que para m la experiencia de los juegos ol mpicos ha sido lo m ximo
4116314 ser lo que dios quiera pero mi deseo es seguir trabajando para hacerme mejor boxeador
4116315 pederastas parados consangu neos bienvenida a casa de los chtis
4116316 el juez ha tenido en cuenta el trabajo que el club hab a realizado antes y durante el partido para prevenir todos los incidentes
4116317 la federaci n recibi una comunicaci n de los directivos del psv eindhoven en la que se precisa que dison m ndez no alcanz a recuperarse de una lesi n
4116318 la ausencia de m ndez ser cubierta por fernando hidalgo uno de los jugadores locales de mayores progresos en los ltimos tiempos seg n el seleccionador
4116319 no he hablado con bojan he preguntado a su entrenador y con el director deportivo durante el partido hablamos de estos asuntos
4116320 lo que ocurri en el pasado fue un asunto privado que lo resolvieron en aquel momento los que dirig an a la selecci n luis aragon s el primero ahora es una nueva etapa y creemos conveniente traer a bojan como un jugador que es muy bueno y al que vamos a apoyar
4116321 esa es la ventaja de competir en tu pa s los aficionados pusieron una gran carga de presi n sobre los refer s
4116322 en este combate aprend un poco m s sobre t cnicas de judo que antes no entend a
4116323 estoy satisfecha con mi actuaci n le doy las gracias a mi familia a mi pa s y a toda la gente que siempre me apoy
4116324 voy a seguir trabajando quiero que la gente siga creyendo en m porque la pr xima vez voy a tener mejores resultados
4116325 el pr ximo a o en el campeonato mundial y despu s otra vez en los ol mpicos pienso ganarme el oro
4116326 en la villa ol mpica todo el mundo ven a a felicitarme y eso me ha hecho sentir mucha presi n
4116327 tengo que concentrarme para tratar de bajar el tiempo que hice y asegurarme la final
4116328 es una prueba siempre muy ajustada una d cima de segundo separa el cielo del infierno
4116329 mi meta es bajar mi tiempo y eso es lo que voy a intentar en las semifinales de ma ana
4116330 estos son mis primeros juegos ol mpicos as que estoy muy contenta
4116331 gan la pelea por mi gran preparaci n y por el coraz n nunca me di por vencido y hasta el final pens que podr a ganar
4116332 todo el esfuerzo de la preparaci n me salv y ahora me siento feliz
4116333 ahora estoy m s motivado para alcanzar el gran sue o de llegar a unos juegos ol mpicos e irme con una medalla
4116334 cada d a tengo m s fuerza y con la ayuda de dios tambi n ganar al pr ximo rival
4116335 es una pena porque como todo el mundo vio jefferson estaba en muy buen momento pero conf o en la fuerza del resto del equipo para superarlo
4116336 la primera conclusi n de la victoria es romper el maleficio del 2 0 dominar los partidos y luego terminar empat ndolos
4116337 en realidad no fue el mejor las chicas en los otros partidos jugaron bien lo que s jap n hoy se qued muy abajo es muy dif cil hacerle goles pero bueno de a poco fuimos encontrando el camino las chicas manejaron bien la pelota y despu s nos agarr el nerviosismo de nuevo con el 2 0 y jap n empez a tirar m s la pelota pero por suerte rompimos ese maleficio
4116338 tener m s agresividad en ataque porque el empate nosotros ya no lo quer amos y la agresividad constaba en que los volantes llegaran m s al rea porque lleg bamos muy poco con los delanteros que los volantes tambi n lleguen a posici n de gol y buscar c rner ya que era muy dif cil tirar al arco porque siempre hab a japonesas cerca el c rner era una carta que nosotros ten amos importante
4116339 las chicas jugaron mejor este equipo siempre va de menor a mayor necesita estos partidos as que tambi n vamos a ir a jugar m s tranquilos con alemania
4116340 en todas las l neas estuvo bien la l nea de ataque tambi n ten a que defender mucho y por suerte eso fue algo que vinimos entrenando desde hace cuatro meses
4116341 finalmente lleg porque m s all de no haber hecho un gol en el primer tiempo creo que argentina tuvo el 85 por ciento del tiempo la pelota
4116342 ten a m s que ver con lo an mico
4116343 estoy muy feliz por el triunfo en el d a de mi cumplea os pero la verdad es que me prepar para que esto sucediese
4116344 estoy listo para todo lo que venga sin importar el rival
4116345 ya lo he ganado siempre se me dan bien los p giles rusos y estoy listo para seguir en la b squeda de la medalla de oro
4116346 he venido para llevarme una medalla y lo voy a conseguir
4116347 hizo una pelea excepcional demostr la madurez que tiene y que est listo para conseguir la medalla
4116348 siempre se le han dado bien los boxeadores rusos los ha ganado a todos y ahora seguir en esa l nea
4116349 realmente me siento feliz y adem s es algo hermoso escuchar el aliento de mis dos hermanos que estaban en el estadio
4116350 y de alguna manera pod a sentir el apoyo de todas las personas que est n en m xico
4116351 yo ven a nadando fuerte y sab a que iba a llegar alto
4116352 creo que esta ha sido la mejor de mis tres carreras
4116353 estoy muy contento de que haya depositado tanta confianza en mi
4116354 i have not had a very serious tough election up until this primary
4116355 i dont know if the problems in the gibbons administration drag the ticket down rather than that its a loss of the opportunity to lift the ticket up
4116356 i dont think the governors numbers have negative coattails but its the loss of the opportunity to be able to stand next to the governor
4116357 you cant get any higher than where the republicans were in 2002
4116358 they really won it all once they hit that level their farm team had been pushed up they werent grooming anyone for office that was going to result in an uptick for democrats irrespective of the national scene
4116359 the overall republican brand doesnt seem to be as appealing
4116360 but im optimistic that all of our incumbents are going to win if we stay a red state ill be a hero if we dont im not going to be happy
4116361 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4116362 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4116363 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4116364 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4116365 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4116366 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4116367 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4116368 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4116369 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4116370 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take

4116372 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4116373 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4116374 they twente imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4116375 och dagen kom n r det var farligare att f rbli i knopp n att sl ut i blom
4116376 there is a huge difference between us and other countries in the way we prepare for international events every country has serious olympic programme in place unfortunately we do not have it in india we can make progress if only we have a programme which can provide grassroot level training to athletes from all over the country
4116377 i thank ioa and sai for the role they played in my success they can do a lot more now to inspire other sportspersons to bring glory
4116378 i had some troubles i dont know what happened at the end of the day it gun worked so i dont want to think about it
4116379 i am overwhelmed and honoured that i have got a chance to meet these people it is a proud moment for me

4116383 very well organised and sophisticated business importing and selling fake trainers
4116384 whether the people who bought them knew they were fake or believed they were genuine one cannot say but what one can say is that they would never have been of the quality of the genuine article
4116385 you came here illegally and what you have done over the last few months has effectively deceived everybody and that cannot be tolerated
4116386 the fake trainers may seem like a bargain but they are actually poor quality and will fall apart after only a short time
4116387 insiders said tsvangirai was parroting the same sentiments expressed by the united states the and britain
4116388 a fresh position paper titled notes on the dialogue to date which appeared to repudiate all the agreements already signed and would have set back the status of the negotiations by weeks

4116391 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners schwarzenegger spokesman
4116392 but schwarzenegger will have to miss some of his own party because of a far less glamorous side of his life the summer budget stalemate in sacramento
4116393 he said he would fly in his private jet between budget talks in the state capital and the governors conference in los angeles which ends friday
4116394 the other governors will understand that the budget is the most important thing right now he said they too have states to run
4116395 the event is just one example of how the budget deadlock now in its seventh week has crimped schwarzeneggers high flying style
4116396 warning that california faces catastrophic water shortages from a worsening drought sen
4116397 feinstein has joined republican gov arnold schwarzenegger in calling for major improvements to state water storage and delivery systems but their water bond plan has run aground in the legislature
4116398 lawmakers particularly democrats have been loath to support the program which would include 3 billion for water storage and 1 9 billion to repair levees and restore the ecosystem of the sacramento san joaquin delta
4116399 legislative efforts to place the measure on the november ballot have also stumbled amid the states bitter budget standoff
4116400 in a speech to the sacramento metropolitan chamber of commerce feinstein urged lawmakers to end the budget stalemate and put the water infrastructure proposal on the ballot
4116401 at a news conference oconnell announced it would cost that much for schools to be able to teach algebra 1 to all eighth graders starting in three years
4116402 the 3 1 billion represents the overall cost of a new algebra 1 success initiative which oconnell released tuesday it calls for reduced class sizes more instructional time summer programs teacher training and many other efforts
4116403 the state is in a fiscal crisis and budget stalemate when asked where the cash would come from oconnell shrugged saying the algebra mandate was something the governor foisted upon us
4116404 schwarzenegger did not respond to the specific call for 3 1 billion instead he issued a statement saying he looked forward to working with the education community to determine the best path toward the new algebra goal
4116405 a bill allowing cities and counties to set up hot lines and ensure confidentiality for whistle blowing employees who report alleged fraud waste and mismanagement
4116406 swanson said the bill will be held until the legislature approves a budget because gov arnold schwarzenegger has said he will not sign bills until then
4116407 public employees are a direct line of defense against waste fraud and abuse swanson said in a statement this is a piece of legislation which was long overdue
4116408 ruby said the bill will buttress an oakland ordinance which the city council adopted last month that established a whistle blower hot line in the city and designated the auditors office as the lead investigating unit for reports of fraud in city government
4116409 reversing course from only a week ago the los angeles county board of supervisors voted 3 to 2 on tuesday to put a sales tax increase for mass transit and road projects on the nov 4 ballot
4116410 however the board also voted 3 to 2 to officially oppose the measure
4116411 last month the metropolitan transportation authority board voted to put a half cent sales tax increase on the general election ballot
4116412 but last week the supervisors three of whom say the sales tax wouldnt spread money evenly across the county refused to put the initiative on the regular ballot
4116413 instead they forced the sales tax onto a supplemental ballot
4116414 however after learning that a supplemental ballot would cost county taxpayers an additional 10 million supervisor don knabe said he would change his vote even though he continued to oppose the sales tax increase

4116448 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

4116454 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4116455 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4116456 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off

4116536 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4116537 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4116538 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4116539 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max

4116542 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4116543 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low

4116551 nothing we can do about it weve got pitchers who can throw to hitters too
4116552 its part of the game but you cant throw up at someones head

4116577 he must not have read our proposal if he did he must not understand it
4116578 i applaud what theyre doing over there but what they dont understand is if we tried to bring their proposal to the floor in the senate it would never get 60 votes
4116579 we both agreed that it is not the wave of the future its the wave of the present

4116593 the buzzword is shared services under which different bodies share corporate functions such as finance and personnel reversing a decades old trend of allowing different agencies to do their own thing however there is a fine line between achieving economies of scale and returning to a 1960s style dependence on government wide data centres

4116595 the time for innovation in journalism is over it s mature it s been done perfected written about studied taught and analyzed for a couple of centuries it comes down to a few simple things check your facts include as many sources as possible avoid bias avoid libel jesus christ these are things a ten year old can grasp the innovation the ideas in the internet age must come from the content delivery side
4116596 what we have here is well over 200 businesses about 100 property owners who deserve to be treated fairly and ive called continually on the administration to work with them
4116597 this is not about the council and advocates killing the plan its about making the plan fairer for everyone
4116598 i cant understand how one day they can just put a picture of a condo or a hotel on your property and nobody even talks to you
4116599 you just open the newspaper one day and see a hotel and say this is my land
4116600 guarantee me that these people that live here are going to have a home around there and then we can talk about it
4116601 because now i dont think any of the people that are living there right now are going to have a home or an apartment or job to work around there
4116602 the city has made 500 calls meetings and then they stand up and say the citys not meeting with them
4116603 everybodys got to be honest and open to working this out everybody could win in the end
4116604 theyre pushing for it our rezoning plan for chinatown and the lower east side
4116605 thats basically going to cut out and up zone all the areas of people of color and create massive displacement
4116606 weve had meetings that were open and publicized and advertised to everybody anyone was welcome to come
4116607 so frankly those allegations that weve had closed meetings are absolutely baseless
4116608 why we find it difficult to trust certain climate scientists
4116609 there are many many other convincing lines of evidence which strongly support modern agw
4116610 the key point in this is the quality of the science the estimations done by giss are sloppy the peer review process is incredibly sloppy the failure of anyone in the alarmist community to check the quality of the surface temp station siting is really sloppy the adoption of the hockey stick without anyone making an effort to check manns work was beyond sloppy the wild guess assumptions uncovered in the sea surface temp records was sloppy the failure to archive samples and data sets is sloppy the unwillingness of ipcc scientists to comply with its record requirements is sloppy the calls to stifle dissent is way beyond sloppy there seems to be a pattern developing here regarding the quality of the science
4116611 the refusal to employ the services of the best experts in statistics forecasting and computer modelling is sloppy
4116612 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
4116613 even im embarrassed by the tone of hansen on many occasions but disagreeing with his political stances is a far cry from alleging that he conducts fraud in his scientific work
4116614 we have to get rid of the medieval warm period to any input number resulted in the same graph being reconstructed
4116615 i find myself reading a lot of vitriolic ad hominem attacks straightforward defamations based upon nothing but speculation
4116616 of course the method is not robust to red noise but random variations in tree ring growth have been shown to be white noise
4116617 its true that the antarctic ice cap has a slight positive trend
4116618 i think when cooling become incontrovertible and the house of cards comes fluttering down then the eyes of the public will behold all science and scientists with disdain i fear that will be the real legacy of hansen and mann how much this will impact adapting to the cooler regime is unclear but a couple well placed cold snaps could be disastrous at least the high price of energy is encouraging conservation and weatherproofing so that will be a help
4116619 ok so maybe we were wrong in that little part of the analysis but our overall conclusion is still correct
4116620 no skeptic on the blogosphere has been able to demonstrate where the physics behind agw is incorrect
4116621 hockey stick no one has debunked the stick the only thing that has been shown is that there is a great deal more uncertainty in that particular reconstruction than in others
4116622 i said very clearly that if i had been a manager or principal of the next ipcc report i would have wanted to understand very clearly what if anything was wrong with it and how we could avoid such mistakes in the future
4116623 that the statistical foundations on which they had built this paleoclimate castle were a swamp of misrepresentation deceit and malfeasance was to wahl and amman an irrelevance
4116624 the basis of the issue is that models produce an enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere when there is warming at the surface this is true enough whether the warming is from greenhouse gases el ninos or solar forcing trends aloft are enhanced for instance the giss model equilibrium runs with 2xco2 or a 2 increase in solar forcing both show a maximum around 20n to 20s around 300mb 10 km

4116658 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
4116659 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

4116733 la invasi n rusa de georgia es un golpe contra el n cleo de los valores occidentales en nuestro sistema de seguridad del siglo xxi si la comunidad internacional permite a rusia aplastar nuestro estado democr tico e independiente dar carta blanca a gobiernos autoritarios de todo el mundo rusia no s lo trata de destruir un pa s sino tambi n una idea durante demasiado tiempo hemos estado infravalorando la crueldad del r gimen de mosc ayer dio m s pruebas de su duplicidad a las 24 horas de acordar un alto el fuego las fuerzas rusas entraban en gori bloqueaban el puerto de poti hund an nav os georgianos y lo peor de todo purgaban con brutalidad poblaciones georgianas en osetia del sur violando mujeres y ejecutando hombres no se puede confiar en la direcci n rusa y esa dura realidad ha de ser la gu a de la respuesta occidental s lo las fuerzas occidentales de paz pueden poner fin a la guerra
4116734 algunos estadounidenses se preguntan si los sucesos en esa parte del mundo son motivo de preocupaci n para nosotros despu s de todo georgia es un lugar remoto peque o y oscuro sin embargo a menudo la historia se hace en lugares remotos y oscuros aunque el gobierno ruso dice que s lo est actuando para proteger a los osetios el verdadero objetivo ruso parece ser el cambio de r gimen a pesar del alto el fuego conseguido gracias a la mediaci n francesa que preocupantemente no hace referencias a la integridad territorial georgiana prosiguen los ataques rusos
4116735 el pueblo georgiano ha sufrido con anterioridad y sufrir ahora debemos ayudarle en esta tragedia y debe saber que los pensamientos oraciones y apoyo norteamericanos est n con l esta peque a democracia alejada de nuestras costas sirve de inspiraci n para los que comparten nuestros m s alabados ideales como le dije al presidente saakashvili el d a que se declar el alto el fuego hoy somos todos georgianos no debemos olvidarlo
4116736 el mi rcoles por la ma ana el presidente dmitri medvedev prometi a los negociadores europeos que rusia detendr a los ataques a georgia y que empezar a la retirada de sus tropas unas horas m s tarde los tanques rusos se adentraban en la encrucijada estrat gica de la ciudad de gori a s lo 40 millas de la capital de georgia tbilisi no estamos seguros de si esto significa que medvedev no es quien est al mando o que estaba mintiendo para ganar tiempo para derrocar el gobierno democr ticamente electo de georgia ambas explicaciones producen escalofr os
4116737 estados unidos y sus aliados deben advertir a mosc que su deseo de unirse a la omc no llegar a ninguna parte mientras siga brutalizando a su vecino la uni n europea debe decir a rusia que no emprender acuerdos de cooperaci n econ mica y pol tica hasta que mosc no est dispuesto a comportarse como un socio responsable
4116738 rusia acord el martes detener la acci n militar en georgia el presidente ruso dimitry medvedev y el primer ministro vladimir putin s lo est n ganando tiempo ya que aceptan detener las acciones militares pero exigen la retirada de las tropas georgianas de osetia del sur y de abjasia tambi n est n pidiendo un cambio de r gimen el kremlin busca socavar a georgia y ganar gradualmente el control sobre los pa ses que formaban parte de la ex uni n sovi tica los rusos est n en el camino hacia el imperialismo y deben ser detenidos
4116739 occidente tiene la oportunidad de enviar una se al tanto a rusia como a toda la regi n de que la era sovi tica ha terminado el presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy que tambi n lidera la ue ha insistido en que rusia y georgia se retiren a las posiciones que ten a antes del conflicto la ue deber a ser a n m s firme las tropas rusas han demostrado que no pueden funcionar como fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz en la regi n estas tropas deben ser sustituidas por las fuerzas de las naciones unidas para garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos de osetia del sur y de abjasia y evitar futuras conflagraciones occidente debe insistir en que no habr cambio de r gimen en georgia y en que los esfuerzos para integrar a georgia en la otan no han llegado a su fin este es un momento definitivo para la regi n
4116740 los jefes de exteriores de los pa ses de la ue aprobaron ayer en bruselas en una reuni n de urgencia un plan de regulaci n para la situaci n en osetia del sur este plan fue acordado la v spera por los presidentes de rusia y francia dmitri medvedev y nicol s sarkozy el ministro de exteriores franc s bernard kouchner declar que la ue est dispuesta a enviar a georgia a inspectores europeos george bush ha expresado la posici n oficial de los ee uu rusia debe mantener su palabra y poner fin a esta crisis declar el dirigente estadounidense al tiempo que expres la esperanza de que rusia permita desplegar en georgia toda la ayuda humanitaria posible seg n bush con sus acciones rusia pone en una situaci n arriesgada su participaci n en las instituciones internacionales
4116741 el presidente de ee uu george bush amenaz ayer a rusia con el aislamiento internacional y anunci el inicio de su injerencia en el conflicto georgiano osetio se trata del env o a georgia de ayuda humanitaria el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvili minutos despu s de las declaraciones de george bush explic que los aviones y barcos estadounidenses asumir n la vigilancia de los puertos y aeropuertos georgianos los medios de comunicaci n estadounidenses informan al un sono de que la causa fundamental de la guerra es el intento de mosc de no permitir la exportaci n de hidrocarburos del caspio hacia occidente evitando pasar por el territorio rusia
4116742 el plan de regulaci n del conflicto georgiano oseta propuesto por el presidente dmitri medvedev fue convenido ayer en bruselas por los ministros de asuntos exteriores de la ue en l la parte georgiana ha precisado s lo un punto pero clave el referente al estatus de osetia del sur y abjasia los expertos consideran que rusia se ha visto obligada a hacer esta concesi n dado que en caso contrario se ver a inmersa en el aislamiento pol tico el problema se ahonda a n m s con el hecho de que rusia casi ha perdido la guerra informativa
4116743 rusia ha perdido la guerra informativa de las pantallas de los canales de televisi n occidentales s lo han salido noticias de la agresi n rusa contra la soberana georgia y los torrentes de desinformaci n se completaban con informes sobre el ataque de los tanques rusos sobre tbilisi durante las primeras quince horas cuando tbilisi bombardeaba tsijinvali y eliminaba a su poblaci n civil las agencias de informaci n mundiales simplemente callaron
4116744 rusia afirma que utiliz su derecho de leg tima defensa contra georgia
4116745 en una carta presentada por mosc como documento oficial ante el consejo de seguridad de la onu consta que rusia ejerci su derecho a una leg tima defensa a ra z de la agresi n georgiana contra osetia del sur el lanzamiento de una operaci n militar georgiana en osetia del sur subraya el documento fue una violaci n de los acuerdos existentes sobre el cese del fuego en la zona del conflicto georgiano oseta provoc notables destrucciones en la capital suroseta tsjinvali y caus 1 500 v ctimas civiles la mayor a de las cuales ten an nacionalidad rusa el contingente ruso de paz que forma parte de las fuerzas mixtas para el mantenimiento de la paz y permanece en el territorio georgiano con car cter legal tambi n sufri bajas a ra z de ese ataque masivo y deliberado las tropas rusas subraya la carta recibieron la orden de no realizar ataques contra la poblaci n y las instalaciones civiles
4116746 el presidente georgiano ha hecho muy a su pesar un gran favor a rusia
4116747 la guerra ruso georgiana que marcar el verano de 2008 es un conflicto tradicional entre dos estados en torno a un desaf o aparentemente claro la suerte de osetia del sur pero se deriva sobre todo de la voluntad despiadada de ambas partes de cuestionar los equilibrios geopol ticos existentes desde hace casi veinte a os esta guerra confirma en definitiva el regreso de rusia al panorama internacional una rusia segura de s misma que manifiesta sin complejos sus intereses nacionales tambi n supone la aceptaci n por parte de la comunidad de naciones de tratar con esta rusia y no con un estado disminuido saakachvili en su loco proyecto de desafiar a rusia le ha hecho probablemente el mayor favor de los ltimos a os
4116748 fin de la secuencia europea inicio de la secuencia americana las palabras de george w bush han marcado un cambio muy claro en la evoluci n del conflicto georgiano un cambio de los m s cl sicos tras la brutal intervenci n rusa y la mediaci n europea entramos en la fase l gica del enfrentamiento entre las dos grandes potencias tradicionales bush ense a sus m sculos enviando aviones y barcos militares para dar ayuda humanitaria a georgia tambi n env a a tbilisi a condoleeza rice
4116749 en cuanto a los europeos divididos entre los antiguos y nuevos miembros de la uni n los primeros comprensivos con rusia los segundos para nada esperan que el acuerdo sarkozy medvedev aguante alg n tiempo los rusos quieren afirmar su tutela sobre su extranjero cercano
4116750 la c pula rusa no tiene mucho que temer si sus tropas contin an operando en georgia e ignoran el plan de paz que al fin y al cabo ha sido aceptado por medvedev al menos no tiene que temer nada de la ue que ya est toda orgullosa de querer enviar a observadores que adem s no son de la otan puede que realmente haya llegado el momento de reflexionar sobre el papel de rusia en el g 8 y no se puede negociar un acuerdo de asociaci n como si no hubiera ocurrido nada
4116751 los europeos hacen como si pudieran relajar la situaci n con tropas de paz de la ue pero rusia no ha dado su aprobaci n y ning n pa s europeo enviar voluntariamente soldados a una zona en conflicto sin la aprobaci n de todos los involucrados por tanto de momento se trata de un debate fantasma con el que la ue trata de ocultar su verdadero problema europa est profundamente dividida en cuanto a la respuesta que debe dar a la manifestaci n de poder rusa ahora que la ue ha asumido el papel de mediador rusia puede prepararse para un escenario c modo am rica est lejos y en plena campa a electoral europa capitula ante el poder y ante si misma
4116752 la uni n europea acaba de obtener por mediaci n del presidente sarkozy un hermoso pero fr gil xito diplom tico al conseguir que los beligerantes rusos y georgianos aprueben un plan de paz conviene felicitarse sin caer en triunfalismos de que los europeos a menudo ausentes y o divididos y o impotentes en la escena internacional hayan asumido sus responsabilidades la ue dispone de las mejores bazas para actuar como interlocutor privilegiado de mosc y tbilisi ya que ee uu tiene demasiados nexos con los georgianos y el consejo de seguridad de la onu no puede hacer caso omiso del parecer de los rusos
4116753 no obstante el ejercicio se anuncia delicado sobre todo porque tras vencer las reticencias polacas y lituanas la ue se dispone a negociar un nuevo acuerdo de asociaci n con rusia que resulta de vital importancia teniendo en cuenta las necesidades energ ticas de la ue
4116754 el conflicto en el c ucaso toca a su fin puede que tan s lo sea una paz temporal pero no cabe duda de que la violencia militar ha decrecido en beneficio de la diplomacia los mediadores hacen cola y la ue quiere demostrar de lo es capaz tras fracasar en los balcanes la uni n desea tener m s xito en el c ucaso ya que es consciente de que el tema es europeo ciertamente georgia no es miembro de la ue ni de la otan y rusia sigue siendo rusia pero el polvor n cauc sico est en nuestro patio trasero tbilisi y mosc han de llegar a una soluci n aceptable con la ayuda y mediaci n de europa
4116755 el l der georgiano saakachvili cay en la trampa de mosc en pocos d as putin controla la regi n disputada y amenaza con reducir a georgia a una entidad virtual la guerra de georgia primera acci n b lica de la ex uni n sovi tica no s lo tiene un fuerte impacto regional sino que da una portentosa lecci n a los estados unidos contribuyendo a redefinir los equilibrios globales la balbuciente respuesta norteamericana al conflicto ruso georgiano es la consecuencia de una pol tica titubeante entre ganarse la amistad de putin y el intento de logar una nato dilatada capaz de anular la influencia rusa en europa este peligro que al inicio asust a los rusos ha ocasionado predecibles reacciones
4116756 que estados unidos amenace con excluir a rusia del g8 y env e ayudas humanitarias en naves militares a georgia puede contribuir a la campa a electoral republicana pero no asustar a putin convencido del apoyo de sus aliados de la vieja europa

4116776 o foco do nosso laborat rio s o as doen as negligenciadas o objetivo desse projeto era estudar os venenos de diversos anf bios como ferramenta para a busca de novos f rmacos depois de uma triagem feita com diversos animais elegemos o sapo cururu j que ele mostrava aspectos interessantes para bioprospec o
4116777 essas mol culas s o mais interessantes do ponto de vista farmac utico por serem menores e mais f ceis de sintetizar
4116778 a gl ndula parot ide do sapo conta com uma quantidade imensa de veneno que tem uma toxicidade imensa mas com a purifica o da mol cula ativa eliminamos a parte t xica e testamos o elemento ativo no parasita
4116779 curiosamente descobrimos na literatura que a telocinobufagina produzida tamb m pelo organismo humano n o foi muito estudada mas possivelmente tem fun es no controle da press o sang nea
4116780 n o sabemos ainda se o sapo usa esses ester ides para prote o mas poss vel que como vivem em um lugar seco e t m pele muito sens vel eles sirvam para defender o animal de fungos e bact rias no ch o
4116781 inclusive no pouco estudado bioma da caatinga jared levantou a hip tese de que os ester ides s o possivelmente incorporados pelo sapo por meio da dieta
4116782 essas mol culas j eram conhecidas em plantas da regi o mas at agora n o haviam sido observadas no sapo possivelmente elas s o conseguidas pelo animal por meio de um inseto que ingeriu determinadas plantas
4116783 tudo isso faz com que essas mol culas sejam modelos interessantes agora que identificamos sua estrutura qu mica vamos tentar sintetiz las e testar novos desenhos com potencial para uma efici ncia ainda maior o passo seguinte ser a aplica o de testes em animais

4116799 hes a player i signed to play at souths but then i left i know him quite well i know what hes capable of doing he will provide a very good option for us playing at six or seven along with richard myler and stefan ratchford
4116800 hes got a very good kicking game and he directs people around the field very well hes a lot more experienced than stefan and richard and thats what i was looking for
4116801 i knew that i couldnt go into super league and expect a 20 year old and an 18 year old to lead us around the field well every single week
4116802 jeremy is a top class half back of proven ability who will greatly assist with the development of our younger players stefan and richard have enormous talent and potential and they can learn so much and benefit greatly from playing with jeremy
4116803 he is a very good signing for this club and he is greatly looking forward to playing for us in super league
4116804 we are absolutely thrilled and delighted to be bringing in a top quality player of jeremys stature

4116807 fehintola is a good technical boxer and i know its going to be tough because both of us will be really up for it
4116808 but the arthur fight gave me a taste of the big time and i want to get to world level again
4116809 im not too sure who will win out of arthur and cook the only thing im certain of is that i want the winner
4116810 i can mix it with the best and if i cant get arthur or cook then i want british and commonwealth champion kevin mitchell ill fight whoever they put in front of me
4116811 sometimes i look back at that 11th round when i had arthur on the floor and wish i could have finished him off the fight has gone now so theres no point in looking back but its made me even more determined to fulfil my childhood dream of winning a big world title
4116812 that arthur fight showed how strong i can be at super featherweight
4116813 it used to be a big big struggle getting down to featherweight and i feel so much better now
4116814 it is still mathematically possible for us to reach the play offs and we will battle to the last but we will need to have an awful lot of lady luck on our side now
4116815 we have two matches left and our aim is simply to try to win those games and end the season strongly
4116816 we play oldham on sunday and they are undoubtedly one of the best sides in the division they are going for automatic promotion so they will see it as a must win game and they have won all three of their previous meetings with us this season but we played well in two of those games and i certainly think that we are capable of beating them on sunday as long as we play a lot smarter than we did in our defeat to rochdale at the weekend
4116817 robbie paul will play a different role next season and if you saw the dewsbury game you will know what that role is
4116818 hooking is one of the hardest jobs in the modern game in terms of energy levels
4116819 yo me asust y entristec al escuchar sobre la tragedia en arkansas
4116820 we are keen to speak to anyone who has any information about this attack
4116821 the victim and another man asked someone for directions to the graveyard before the attack it would probably have seemed an unusual request and i am certain the person will remember the conversation
4116822 i am appealing to this man to come forward as he could hold information vital to the inquiry
4116823 i would also like to hear from anyone else that may have been in the area in the early hours of monday morning to contact police
4116824 of the 50 people attending the church only six are in full time employment so the effort by local people to raise 150 000 of the money has been tremendous
4116825 the vision is for the new building to be a place for the whole community to use
4116826 we are delighted virgin has made this generous gesture and are anxious to get the job done quickly
4116827 we are happy to help the community we are hoping to start work later this week
4116828 we have a lot of elderly customers who will not be able to go anywhere else it is a sad day for all of us and i would like to thank everyone involved in the fight to keep the post office open
4116829 there has been no date set for the closure all i know is that it will be after september 23 to make sure everyone knows about the closure
4116830 the worst about it is that we just have not been given a reason for the decision its very upsetting
4116831 we are very disappointed at the outcome of the consultation as a langworthy ward councillor who had meetings with the senior executives of the post office to explain the need for the post office in that area i feel i and the community of langworthy have not been listened to or taken seriously by the post office
4116832 there is a retirement home just behind us and obviously a lot of residents come to us its obviously going to cost me my job too its an awful situation to be in
4116833 these are difficult decisions which have not been taken lightly
4116834 we believe that the plan offers our customers in this area the best prospect for a sustainable network in the future
4116835 the olympics are a special event and the pressures are unique
4116836 the big test for any athlete is to perform under that pressure to be able to step up when it counts no excuses and no second chances
4116837 personally i draw upon my experiences from athens to give me the confidence i know that i have dealt with this pressure in the past and i can do it again
4116838 i have been to two olympics sydney and athens and there is a special atmosphere when you walk into the olympic arena on the day there is a tension that tells you this is what it is all about its a mixture of exhilaration and sheer terror
4116839 michelles preparation could not have gone much better her spirits are good and she is looking at her fittest
4116840 the olympics are here for her its no longer a dream but a reality mind you on her first day in the village she just said it is surreal
4116841 we and the rest of the walkden gym are very proud of rebecca and her achievements
4116842 i have never questioned the commitment of the players i am just disappointed that we had the lead in the first half and looked as though we were going to give the hornets a real game only to have an explosion
4116843 we thought we were st helens and could score on any play that we wanted to and it just went from bad to worse

4116845 the beach is absolutely fantastic the beach is in front of us and theyve got palm trees which is nice
4116846 theres plenty for the kids to do if you cant go on holiday this is a good option its absolutely fantastic
4116847 i think its a great idea you dont usually expect to see a beach in salford
4116848 its been fantastic theres been a hell of a lot of people here which is just what we wanted the rains stayed away and its gone really well
4116849 we will be looking at civil proceedings to recover the cost from both women of diverting the flight to frankfurt and this could run into thousands
4116850 we will not tolerate any behaviour considered a threat to the safety of our passengers crew or property
4116851 following an official complaint now received by gmp this incident is being investigated by officers at manchester airport
4116852 officers are now gathering evidence and enquiries are continuing gmp is now liaising with interpol to ensure they are kept up to date with developments
4116853 they were absolutely out of their heads i was behind them at the airport when they tried to get through control with a different bottle of vodka
4116854 security wouldnt let them through so they turned round put towels down in the car park and drank it out there
4116855 they should never have been let on the plane in the first place
4116856 their behaviour was appalling leanne did try to open the door she said she needed some fresh air
4116857 now we hardly visit each others homes or patronise each others shops we are cordial to each other when we meet and some hindus and muslims invite each other for marriages but that is all we really dont have love in our hearts for each other
4116858 in 1947 several muslims were killed by hindu and sikh mobs in league with the maharajas forces some hindus were killed in bhalesa a muslim majority part of doda under shaikh abdullah radical land reforms were introduced in the state through which share croppers mainly muslims and dalits got land previously owned by rajput and brahmin landlords and this naturally incensed the upper castes who felt their dominance was being undermined
4116859 the sort of ethnically separated and divided localities that you have in places like delhi and up are totally absent here
4116860 earlier doda was cut off from the rest of the state due to the difficult mountainous terrain we were to a large extent insulated from communal conflicts elsewhere but now with the rapid expansion of roads and communications facilities new ideas brought in by communal forces both hindu and muslim have begun to take root if any communal clash takes place somewhere in india news travels at once to doda and makes a sharp impact here militancy in the kashmir valley and oppression of muslims in india not any major local conflicts lie at the root of growing hindu muslim divisions in doda
4116861 the quran says that god has sent prophets to every nation and so it is possible that some of the religious figures of the hindus were also prophets islam teaches us that we must relate to all non muslims who do not oppress or oppose us with love and concern self styled militants who kill innocents in the name of jihad are doing the work of the devil they are motivated simply by power and pelf not for the sake of god and so what they are doing cannot be called jihad they have zikr e khuda the name of god on their lips but their hearts are empty of fikr e khuda remembrance of god some people wrongly think that picking up the sword against all non muslims is jihad but actually doing anything good even speaking a good word to someone is a jihad
4116862 mooh mai ram ram baghal mai churi they have rams name on their lips and hide a knife in their hands
4116863 our principal task as muslims is to tell others about islam through love and good deeds
4116864 as long as we are allowed to freely practice our religion we cannot declare jihad taking up arms as some of us have just to set up a separate state or join another state or for any such worldly purpose cannot be called a jihad
4116865 when we look at how muslims are being persecuted in india how efforts are being made to destroy article 370 that guarantees a special status for jammu and kashmir how the armed forces go around killing innocent muslims here in doda and elsewhere in our state and how hindutva forces seek to destroy us we muslims even those of us who are vociferously opposed to the militants naturally become increasingly apprehensive
4116866 maybe our youth have become too materialistic indifferent to such social concerns
4116867 woke up a few hours later with a rubber fist i really dont need
4116868 it was the first place i ever raced on the mainland and i won there so its got a place in my heart its a very tight and technical circuit so you have to be quite precise with the car in order to post good times
4116869 the track surface also seems to change quite a lot from year to year which can catch people out there are a few really fast corners too so you have to be brave and really committed going into them im confident well come away having had a good weekend
4116870 knockhill has been a good place for me in the past i picked up my first touring car win there in 2005
4116871 overtaking at knockhill can be quite a challenge because it is a narrow circuit but that just makes it exciting for us drivers and the fans
4116872 with inflation hopefully having peaked we are seeing a swing in the emphasis from central bankers towards slower growth
4116873 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4116874 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4116875 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4116876 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4116877 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection
4116878 two conceptions of civilization have fought for the soul of the peoples of the americas one foreign and recent that of the west the other ancient and native
4116879 for over 2000 years china has been sustained by ideas virtually unchanged since the bronze age
4116880 history of the west more than any other has swung between savagery and idealism a contradiction apparently deeply rooted in our character and history
4116881 how was it that such small countries came to dominate other peoples
4116882 two conceptions of civilization have fought for the soul of the peoples of the americas one foreign and recent that of the west the other ancient and native

4116885 the wests progress to civilization has been long and painful
4116886 the number of critical vulnerabilities patched by the latest set of security patches described in microsofts august security bulletin is high and they are all quite serious so the patches should be applied as soon as possible however we rated most of them with medium risk level since there are no known exploits in the wild except for ms08 041 which we rated with high risk the first samples of malicious scripts exploiting this vulnerability were seen in the wild couple of weeks ago
4116887 one of the main factors we consider when estimating the risk of encountering an attack in the wild is the existence of a proof of concept code or a malware sample and factor this in our equation for estimating the risk we are not trying to assess just how easy is to create an exploit for a certain vulnerability but also how likely it is our users will be hit by one

4116889 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4116890 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people

4116895 benefit consumers by providing easy seamless and convenient travel to more global destinations with better connections improved flight schedules and enhanced frequent flyer benefits
4116896 it will improve customer choice by enabling the oneworld global alliance of which american ba and iberia are key members to compete more effectively around the world with other global alliances
4116897 bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4116898 by working together to provide links for connecting passengers the airlines can expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4116899 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4116900 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4116901 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4116902 we are applying for eu us anti trust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4116903 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world
4116904 it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4116905 this deal is good news for consumers who will now have more choice i dont see it leading to higher prices and i think it will increase competition on transatlantic routes
4116906 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4116907 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed open skies has not delivered the greater competition that was promised because heathrow is full
4116908 ba aa and iberia would still be unacceptably dominant with nearly half of all of the slots at heathrow leaving competitors powerless to take them on
4116909 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
4116910 oh itself did it well let me tell you god made it
4116911 even the mind of god can only imagine those things that have become themselves
4116912 at least i use my own words and no one elses i dont follow any dotted line
4116913 they are impersonal dated said over and over they become almost meaningless while hope is new and fresh each time and isnt attached to any sect
4116914 i have a home a family a job even a philosophy
4116915 pray to god have faith and your prayer will be answered you have only to ask
4116916 ask and it shall be given unto you knock and it shall be opened do you mean
4116917 but i think one needs each time a very cleverly made subtle and fortunate key and besides i should think one who really loves god wouldnt want to ask him favors all the time bother him with this and that like a lobbyist i should think it would be very trying even for god id be afraid of taxing his patience
4116918 i see him as beyond reach too high like fate
4116919 i believe a beggar woman who said god dont care
4116920 im not cursing i think its as vain to curse him as it is to praise him you want him as the almighty and the all loving but if he is both why does he allow so much cruelty in this world
4116921 im not afraid of hell since i dont believe in it hell or heaven how can you be happy in heaven if your brother is in hell it doesnt make sense
4116922 my soul wont outlive my body the soul is life and death is the end or at least i fervently hope so this life is the real thing not a rehearsal and death is final not an intermission dust and ashes they cant die they are immortal because they are not alive immortality belongs to the unliving
4116923 yes if the word heathen comes from heath the wilderness
4116924 so what are you apart from being a heathen i mean are you at the college here
4116925 i thought so a teacher i pity your students you tell them the things you told me

4116933 it has all the hallmarks of the previous attack with the same delivery albeit a slightly different disguise and formatting of the emails and the eventual link directing you to a variant of the same malicious executable download
4116934 at one point on the morning of aug 13 the msnbc spam campaign spiked and equaled the total amount of all spam we were seeing in our traps in other words this is a significant attack
4116935 so far volumes have been ranging in the 1 5 to 2 million message per hour range for the msnbc spam
4116936 although nowhere near the peaks that we saw with the cnn outbreak from last week it also took 3 days for the cnn spam to reach those volumes

4116941 thats happening more this year than last we want to do the right thing by them and try to help it might mean they are now qualified to apply for a three year degree rather than the foundation degree they originally applied for
4116942 if you think that the process of applying to university started before christmas you can see that a lot can happen in that time we have to be realistic about students who break their contracts with what was their top choice university no university wants a student who wants to be somewhere else
4116943 there was one who was so upset she couldnt speak

4116946 we are seeing many more well informed applicants this year
4116947 they ask more about the career paths that the degrees will lead to and the soft skills theyll gain than they did years ago we have very thoughtful discussions with many of them

4117300 the bank took the view that it had to take measures to stop inflation going higher
4117301 the aim was to slow down demand to make it harder for businesses to widen their margins and to force businesses to start cutting their margins again that has happened thats been successful
4117302 we have asked households to cut back on their spending and i think its fair to say that households have responded very favourably
4117303 we set out to bring inflation back to the target range and we are confident that we are on that path and thats why we are in a position to respond on interest rates
4117304 the banks policy has always been to be pre emptive we try to be pre emptive when we start tightening and pre emptive when it comes to easing the reserve bank now finds itself in a position where it is able to think about cutting interest rates mr battellino said

4117311 i was directly involved with everything except the actual cutting of the glass i made the maquettes the scale drawings that show the pieces for me the challenge of course was to take my paintings which are normally tremendously more detailed and to reduce them to these flat patterns of solid colored pieces that still can read as a recognizable scene with depth and dimensionality the process unfolded over about a five year period
4117312 at first being completely new to this material i was reliant to a great deal on the fabricator larry gordon studios out in port washington the earlier pieces unfortunately i wasnt as happy with when we put all the pieces together thousands for each pane they were laid out flat against a wooden table and you couldnt see the light
4117313 growing up a half century ago on the subways between the bronx and harlem gave me an appreciation of how a bit of artistic beauty might give riders and workers opportunities for reflection on where they were and where they might be going it is a privilege to recognize the great stained glass work of daniel hauben who realized this dream id had of subway beautification as a source of personal contemplation
4117314 its an acknowledgment and verification of my connection to the community and a little bit of attention which every artist hopes for

4117446 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4117447 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes

4117455 i bless bean for uncovering these issues and i beg the medical profession to start looking at these diseases more closely
4117456 why do we not care that our kids are on tetracyclines for years for acne
4117457 patients who trade off getting better with long term antibiotics and staying disabled do not think twice
4117458 ive reached the point where i dont foresee me getting completely well but i can live with the way i am right now
4117459 i read so many books that when i finished with them i didnt know which direction to take
4117460 this book is to help people validate their problem so they can take it to their doctor
4117461 my background was in public health and i didnt know why my antibiotic was limited to two weeks
4117462 if i had been remotely exposed to anthrax in a heartbeat i would have been given this same drug long term
4117463 if the disease has become chronic the bacterial spirochetes may no longer be in the bloodstream
4117464 they may have traveled to the brain and other body tissues where they more easily evade the immune system and antibiotics
4117465 he manages to prevail over the doctors who are willing to treat long term
4117466 they have shown the changes and improvements that occur with continued treatment that would not occur if spirochetes had been eradicated after a few weeks of treatment
4117467 document patient improvement with longer term treatment and better outcomes with longer treatment showing continued presence of lyme spirochetes
4117468 well maybe i should keep it for myself i didnt tell her or anyone else that i was going to gift it so whats the harm

4117476 during the bid i was secretary general and i was confronted by many questions about the opening up and reform of china i always said the games will help china open up and reform faster
4117477 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same
4117478 we welcome the people and the colleagues of the olympic games with us and we welcome suggestions that are constructive advice from these people all kinds of peoples but the foreign press you come here to pick critically dig into details but that doesnt mean we dont fulfil on our promises i did not say china would promise to do whatever i did say the games would open up the horizons of china
4117479 we are confident that the games coming to china will not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
4117480 it would start another debate about the olympic spirit here
4117481 according to my information when the british journalist showed his accreditation he was released
4117482 the question now is why is the office in a hurry to execute them
4117483 are they under the pressure of the australian community to execute the three bombers right away
4117484 the preparation leading up to the execution goes on the decision by the constitutional court is not retroactive

4117512 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4117513 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4117514 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4117515 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4117518 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4117519 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4117520 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4117521 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4117522 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4117523 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4117524 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4117622 the mpc has considered recent economic developments and the outlook for inflation and has concluded that notwithstanding certain risks tofuture inflation outcomes the current monetary policy stance is appropriate
4117623 currently oil is trading at around 112 per barrel compared to around 140 per barrel at the time of the previous mpc meeting
4117624 if current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained a further sizeable decline can be expected in september it is still too early to tell if the lower international oil price is a temporaryphenomenon

4117636 this years conference is entitled development of new molecular tumor markers for diagnosis and therapy the subject is well chosen and critical for good reason it reflects the acute need among the scientific community as well as clinicians for new cancer markers to be used in cancer diagnosis and therapy this need arises from the fact that there are presently very few markers their overall performance is not very good and they are limited to a few types of cancer it also reflects on the fact that since afp and cea were first described as cancer markers in the early 60s not many markers have been discovered biocurex has a unique cancer marker in the sense that it combines excellent performance in discriminating patients with cancer from those who do not have cancer along with the ability to detect very early stages of two of the most common cancers breast and prostate recaf our marker also has the potential to be used on a broad spectrum of cancers which is a tremendous advantage at isobm 2008 well be showing results related to the elisa format a type of test that can be carried out in most research and clinical labs we expect to elicit significant interest among scientists to carry out collaborations that will continue to validate independently and through numerous publications the very good performance of the recaf tests

4117642 companies need to do more than talk about green initiatives
4117643 it takes more than high profile ads to make it happen
4117644 being green is an important part of many employees lives and companies do a disservice to themselves and their employees by not acknowledging that
4117645 workers easily see through hypocrisy and lip service and that certainly applies to green programs too

4117661 sales teams have long deployed crm and sfa solutions to support a variety of chronologically ordered questions within the organization the past what did the customer purchase present what is in our pipeline and future when is the deal likely to close for how many dollars and at what probability to seal the deal
4117662 yet the elusive truth about a companys revenue health measured by a more accurate sales forecast may more predictive analytics than crm tools can provide along with informing the sales teams data with intelligence from other silos within the enterprise

4117673 if the supreme court rejects the defense of marriage act as unconstitutional if state legislatures are frustrated by the opinions of jurists in more states than one and if state remedies to such judicial activism fail and finally if a large majority of americans come to perceive that their communities values are being ignored and other standards concerning marriages are being imposed on them against their will and elections and state legislatures can provide no remedy then and only then should we consider quite appropriately amending the constitution of the united states

4117681 i had personal experience of low aspirations of parents in much of the north east not all of the north east
4117682 theres nothing like parental aspiration for improving childrens a level results if you could quantify it i have no doubt that would be the major factor
4117683 there are plenty of parents in london and the south east that have low aspirations for their children but maybe a higher proportion in the north east

4117687 no company in bulgaria has made such investments thus no company could apply to participate in the tenders this was a clear provocation on the part of the administration

4117690 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4117691 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4117692 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4117693 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4117703 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4117704 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4117705 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4117706 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4117707 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4117708 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4117709 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4117715 it has not only served the students well it has served the country well

4117720 talking beats not talking lets put it this way and were looking at the integrity of these databases and thats extremely important we like to think people have a very common concern with lack of organ donation in this country and we can do something about it if we put our minds and hearts into it

4117759 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4117760 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4117761 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4117762 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4117763 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4117764 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4117765 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4117766 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4117767 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4117794 i think i had to pick up some more beer
4117795 no man i just needed some food and i just forgot
4117796 i try to take care of myself as much as i can and try not to follow in the footsteps of some of those who didnt quite make it
4117797 but as for what people expect i am what i am and thats what you get
4117798 freezing and tired hung over rain dripping off the brim of my hat
4117799 yeah if youre an otter youre just swimming around thinking what am i going to do all day try to catch a fish oh whats the point one of my theories is that the dinosaurs just died out from boredom gripped with a type of existential doubt a world weariness
4117800 we went around finding out where animals were in strife and waded in whether we were welcome or not in the north of england there was a problem with otters getting killed on the roads and its an odd thing why did the otter cross the road
4117801 here we are being liberal do gooders and maybe theyve just reached their evolutionary peak where now for the otter except maybe downhill what we did is we realised we figured out that when the rains are you interested in this
4117802 yes anyway it turns out that the waters are too deep and fast flowing for the otters to swim through it so we built a footbridge so they could stay out of the water and off the road an otter walkway and they used it apparently
4117803 in british hotels every single one ive been to has a trouser press whether you request them or not
4117804 a gideon bible a trouser press and tea and coffee making facilities its a kind of a constant and when youre on tour for months on end these things kind of become your companions the things you rely on theyre always there regardless of how the show has gone how youre feeling drunk whatever you can always come back and the trouser press and the gideon bible will be there strangely ive never really used a trouser press ive never felt that ive needed creases in my clothes to improve my appearance
4117805 he doesnt like talking to people anyone it irritates him that he has to walk across the room to answer the phone
4117806 no dont when we were growing up in the 70s there was a game called drink along with dallas every time theyd have a drink youd have a drink with them the first episode i joined in on was the oil barons ball so the whole episode was drinking from start to finish i was virtually hospitalised but no black books is not a life guide
4117807 we did this guitar act the rubber bishops and the place was full of big scary west county skinheads
4117808 one came up to me poked me in the chest and asked me if id been the bloke on stage
4117809 crunk skiffle john lennon started off as a skiffle player
4117810 i try to look for musical styles that have become so entrenched that they become a form of shorthand so if you said trip hop people would immediately have an idea
4117811 im looking at emo in tinselworm a particularly overwrought gothic pounding teen angsty kind of music

4117813 the schools will never be any better if parents like you pull your kids out
4117814 when they see your name above madonna or john butler they realise that you just might be getting somewhere and it gives them something to brag about at work although im pretty sure my mum would still prefer it if id become a doctor
4117815 this year has gone so fast that we havent had time to think about it it happened and then we were on the road touring but at the time we were overwhelmed
4117816 we dont take a lot of notice of how the music industry reacts the main effect on us is that it spurs us on wed hate to have people think were going to get lazy or rest on some pretty laurels
4117817 its a weird thing spending 10 years with the same group of people
4117818 we were playing for nothing and its grown from that and our friendship has grown from that its a brotherhood no cliche its actually true im with these three guys virtually every day its second nature to all of us now
4117819 i dont know where it stems from but on this record it definitely came out from inside me im just not interested in happy love songs which is kind of odd since i am happily married
4117820 maybe its because i write lyrics between midnight and 6am that can be a pretty depressing time to be working alone
4117821 well be letting shihad use just eight channels of the mixing and maybe four lights
4117822 you always feel young at heart just look at the stones your persona doesnt change that much either you mature a bit and you dont go out as much but in the grand scheme of things were still the same blokes who used to ride our pushies down to the shops

4117829 fenland has been a fantastic place to live and work
4117830 i first moved to march in 1996 and in that time ive seen an amazing improvement in both the council and fenland
4117831 as a resident of fenland for 12 years im really looking forward to being able to remain connected to the great things going on at the council
4117832 when the idea was put to me my first question was is there a precedent
4117833 i then asked if it was legal and was told that it was so here we are and the council is confident it will work well both for us and mat
4117834 we have found an exciting and innovative way of retaining his considerable expertise until we have recruited someone who can replace him
4117835 we are the first local authority in the country to fully utilise modern technology to deliver a highly cost effective solution to the problem of maintaining continuity when there is a change in key personnel
4117836 retaining mats services is much more cost efficient than bringing in an interim finance director
4117837 modern technology within the council linked to the world wide web ensures that there are no obstacles in communication
4117838 and an interim manager could not possibly be expected to fulfil all the requirements of the permanent post
4117839 the councils smooth running from the point of his departure a seamless handover to the new appointee and continued coaching and support thereafter
4117840 mat has the experience and knowledge of fenlands future plans and finances and he will remain an invaluable member of the senior management team until a suitable replacement is found suffolk homes
4117841 she just closed in when we got here like giving up she didn t sleep didn t eat hardly even talked
4117842 then one day i found her in her room she had taken an overdose she nearly died
4117843 it was touch and go anyway she went into therapy which was hard how do you be honest about someone like you without people thinking you re barmy
4117844 pete stepped in couldn t bear to see her like that he instructed torchwood to start development for new ways to cross from different universes by reading rift gaps it took a while but rose threw herself into the project got heavily involved when the dimension cannon was finished she was almost like her old self she was coming to you oh i put up a fight but i knew she was only ever going to be happy by finding you even if it meant never seeing me again when the darkness came she really thought it was fate
4117845 it took some getting used to i can tell you doctor
4117846 stop calling him that mum he s not he s not he s just some clone a carbon copy he looks like him and that s where it ends
4117847 i don t want you i want him how could he do this to me
4117848 stop it stop trying to be like him because you re not you re not
4117849 so you stole his screwdriver what does that make you what you gonna do how you gonna convince me doctor
4117850 look we can overrun this pissant democracy whenever we want so have a care what kind of deals you make with them

4117854 i would like to appeal to you that you should be extra sensitive to human rights while combating militancy in certain parts of the country
4117855 besides guarding our frontiers the nation owes you gratitude and always looks forward to the rescue and relief operations rendered by the armed forces during natural calamities
4117856 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society
4117857 the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult
4117858 there have been instances in our country of people taking law into their own hands and causing destruction to life and public property
4117859 howard dont worry about it you arent the first doctor to sleep with one of his patients and you wont be the last

4117888 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs

4117895 its got romance its kind of got the lady eve type thing going on theyre traveling around on steamer ships its got that kind of almost old school feel to it
4117896 originally i heard the budget and i was like what we going to do with all that money
4117897 but then you put these big actors into it and you do it internationally and youre traveling and youre on the road it was also the scale of the movie it was pretty huge actually for what we made it for in some ways it was more ambitious to make this movie for this budget than to make brick for that budget
4117898 its a really difficult character because the character has for lack of a better work quirk to it what rachel really pulls off is actually getting beyond that grounding it
4117899 that was the first day of shooting and darren aronofsky was on set i wasnt terrified at all
4117900 as much as i wanted to do a character based con man movie i didnt want to do that by sweeping the con under the rug i wanted it to have a big fun con that kind of goes somewhere although i feel i should put out there the place it goes at the end isnt where a traditional con man movie goes it definitely has some big cons in it but it also veers off the road a little bit
4117901 its sand beneath your feet the whole time as opposed to rock
4117902 im really curious to see how people react to seeing it a second time as a totally different movie but one that i hope will almost be more interesting
4117903 genres are kind of the seed that everything has started with for both of those it starts sounding kind of effete and arty when you start talking about it but you dont really control that seed or that thing that really grabs you and says oh yeah when it starts rolling its kind of weird how little control youve got and what starts getting you excited for some reason it was the dashiell hammett stuff with brick but this one it was con man movies although thats only an initial thought and doesnt really start rolling until you find something else you care about that attaches itself to that with brick it was actually the high school aspect of it and attaching a lot of the feelings and real subjective memories of high school to these dark noir archetypes that kind of got me going inside with this it was storytelling it was something i had been thinking a lot about in my life about how we use storytelling in our lives kind of taking the con man genre and taking the more romanticized almost fairy tale aspects of the con mans life as opposed to the gritter side of it and then using that as an engine to explore how we use storytelling how we hide behind it and how we need it how were all kind of telling the story of our lives thats kind of blooms whole thing through the whole movie he has this notion which i think we all have at different points that youre faking it and everyone else right outside the window is leading a real life sort of that the real world is kind of right outside your grasp and youre kind of just getting by i dont know how to boil it down to something that would fit on a motivational poster its about realizing that were all faking it and that life is faking it its writing your own life and deciding how youre going to take the world and tell it back to yourself
4117904 but the conclusion i came to is that its a really unhealthy thing to think in those terms i think the ultimate litmus test at the end of the day is just that it comes from you
4117905 but its very much well i think people toss out philip dick sci fi when they mean small dark sci fi although when i think of philip dicks books i think of something very different i think people are confusing it with the movie blade runner to me its a lot more like the first terminator its very sci fi but its also very character based its like the first terminator in that it involves time travel its actually really different from bloom its really violent and dark
4117906 the whole adaptation thing for me when i read a book that i love or a graphic novel that i love my instinct isnt lets turn this into a movie theres a disconnect there for me its almost like finding a pair of boots that you love and wanting to knit a sweater out of them to me it me it makes much more sense just to find things that you love and then whatever they inspire within you to come up with something on your own
4117907 im just waiting for it to play at the new beverly
4117908 that would be like my favorite thing in the world

4117948 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4117949 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4117950 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4117951 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4117952 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4117958 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4118060 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4118061 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4118062 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4118063 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations

4118133 your comments on the system are fairly accruate but by no means the whole picture ill try and elaborate a bit more your character is defined by a number of traits what your character is like and backgrounds what things they have done in their life or other ways in which they interact with the world when you make a roll you pick a trait and background that you think suit the circumstances and then roll a number of dice d8s based on how appropriate your trait is and add your background level other modifiers such as equipment bonus may also apply this dice roll is matched by the gm making a similar roll in opposition to determine whether you are successful or not if you think the odd are in your favour you can add raises to the roll menaing you have to beat the gms roll by a bigger margin the more you add but can apply additional effects to the result as the traits are defined simply by the player and the backgrounds defined by the setting it allows for quite a simulationist approch to character creation and development however that is only the basics of gameplay gateway uses the drama resolution system to structure the development of scenes allowing you to perform any action you can imagine and then describe its effects on the other characters objects or whatever around you in game specific terms its a kind of blend of narrativist and gamist philosophies allowing both the freedom to play the tactics of the game whilst providing the freedom to be inventive and narrate the action of the scene hope that maybe helps people get a better idea of what the game might be like cheerio ben

4118274 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about

4118282 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4118283 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4118284 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4118285 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4118286 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4118287 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4118288 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4118289 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4118290 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4118291 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors
4118292 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
4118293 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
4118294 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
4118295 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
4118296 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
4118297 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
4118298 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
4118299 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
4118300 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
4118301 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon
4118302 they will most likely be small fuel efficient and inexpensive

4118317 while we appreciate those nab members willingness to embrace a retransmission consent quiet period a start date of feb 4 2009 is simply too late and will not go far enough to protect consumers whose signals could be pulled by broadcasters before feb 4
4118318 were focused on the dtv transition theyre are focused on retransmission consent those are two very different sets of business issues
4118319 thats a business decision between the cable company or satellite provider and the local broadcaster
4118320 i dont want to speak on his behalf but martin seemed fine with it
4118321 he said his dates had just been kind of floating around in his min there was nothing magic about his dates
4118322 he is open to options but he has not made a decision on this one
4118323 any voluntary quiet period that does not begin before the agreements actually expire or which is too brief to preclude potentially confusing messages about broadcast carriage during the time of the actual dtv transition represents the illusion of a commitment and does not serve the consumer
4118324 many tv carriage contracts are coming up at the end of the year
4118325 i know fcc commissioner jonathan adelstein has supported the dec 15 date for the very reason the contracts would be expiring at the end of the year this would prevent any kind of ability of broadcasters to leverage that to the detriment of our members and certainly their customers
4118326 while we support a quiet period around the digital transition we strongly believe that all affected parties should be involved and reach a consensus on the parameters before moving forward
4118327 cbs has done many retrans deals with large and small cable operators with absolutely no disruption to the audience we share
4118328 we see nothing in our current negotiations that leads us to believe that will change so we see no need for the kind of quiet period sought by some cable operators

4118333 this presidential election if it goes one way we could see a reimposition of the fairness doctrine
4118334 i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate because there are a few isolated conservatives who might be cherry picked in a net neutrality effort and i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem then whoevers in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine

4118400 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4118401 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4118402 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4118403 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4118404 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4118405 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4118406 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4118407 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
4118408 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4118409 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
4118410 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
4118411 we definitely expect a slowdown in the growth of the tv market
4118412 if you compete in the low end you end up damaging your brand and your profitability
4118413 because of the economic slowdown the chinese market has been very difficult

4118445 i mourn the loss of their culture i know when i was working with them that they were something special but the impact they had was something i took for granted
4118446 ill bet 90 percent of them jumped over nothing too
4118447 i learned to pour coffee over rich thick sheepherder bread with condensed milk
4118448 its better for weight gain and better for the trail

4118470 preventing the onset of illness by simply doing what comes naturally may provide an effective way to save millions of dollars in health care costs and cut hospital waiting lists
4118471 theres nothing to buy no pills no endless pounding the pavement pumping iron or anything like that
4118472 i know it sounds unbelievable but people seem to feel more confident and comfortable knowing theres some sort of cure for their illness than about preventing it from occurring in the first place
4118473 its fair to say society is not particularly interested in prevention instead its hooked on treatment even though it is known that most treatments address symptoms not causes and may lead to the onset of new disease
4118474 as a consequence the concept of taking control of ones health and actually preventing the onset of illness is for many very difficult to entertain
4118475 prevention has been presented either as gym workouts jogging and fad diets as a costly regime of vitamins hormones sexual stimulants or in some instances as ancient wisdom to which only a fortunate few have access
4118476 faced with those sorts of options it is hardly surprising people feel little enthusiasm
4118477 in its place we should invest heavily in promoting prevention so it is seen as an attractive preferred pathway to vibrant health presently developed countries spend on average just three cents in the health dollar on preventive measures

4118510 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4118511 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 per cent

4118573 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials
4118574 the conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas

4118582 funding is presently reviewed on an annual basis and we have budget for the year but we will look for more in the next 18 months to two years
4118583 they come here from all over the world and then pretty soon you cant tell them apart
4118584 contrary to ordinary u s policy israel has been and continues to be allowed to use 26 of this military aid to purchase equipment from israeli manufacturers
4118585 by all accounts the united states has given more money to israel than to any other country the congressional research service s conservative estimate of total cumulative us aid to israel not adjusted for inflation from 1949 through 2007 is 101 1908 billion
4118586 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan
4118587 it deals with something current but something that a lot of people in this country dont know a lot about
4118588 its nice when you get a book which makes you think about issues in the real world rather than just in the book you hear a lot about afghanistan and its interesting to see things from the perspective of someone whos lived there even though terrible things happen in the book it shows you afghanistan as a country the narrator is proud of living in
4118589 we are bombarded in the news with afghanistan so to be taken by the hand into that country and to meet the people through the joy of reading a novel is a really remarkable thing chimamanda ngozi adichies half of a yellow sun does that too you feel youve been absolutely changed that your understanding of the world has been significantly enhanced and not through reading a dry history book theres a huge appetite for that and i think khaled is the strongest at providing it
4118590 the writing of this book was a labour of love for me i grew quite attached to the characters and came to care for them in a most personal way
4118591 sharing this book that means so much to me with readers in the uk has been gratifying to me beyond words

4118594 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
4118595 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
4118596 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
4118597 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
4118598 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
4118599 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
4118600 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
4118601 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people
4118602 we appreciate the vfws help in assisting soldiers it would certainly make it easier for soldiers but there are other ways to help them recoup their money for army travel
4118603 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her i got a bottle smashed over my head and after that i started fighting but i got beat down

4118621 don told me that one time when he was recording with hank fred rose took his hands and put them out just past the treble strings and said don play up here
4118622 it was freds belief which proved accurate that a high whining sound would cut through the noise of a typical roadhouse or bar where people would be talking dancing and carrying on
4118623 hank sr was always my favorite artist and is still my favorite artist so youd have to say don helms was right there with hank in my mind

4118648 there would be a universal disaster and they would perish in the mutual hostilities and fightings
4118649 as a result of religious people being long accustomed to their religious denomination as days passed and it became a habit
4118650 jesus claimed that he is the son of god while moses claimed that he had no son and muhammad claimed that he jesus was created like the rest of humanity
4118651 mani and zoroaster contradicted moses jesus and muhammad regarding the eternal one the coming into being of the world and the reasons for the existence of good and evil
4118652 this sounds like the words of the needy rather than of the laudable self sufficient one you claim that the evidentiary miracle is present and available namely the koran

4118666 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4118667 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4118668 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4118669 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4118670 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4118671 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4118672 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4118673 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4118674 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4118675 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4118676 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4118677 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4118678 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4118679 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4118680 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4118681 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4118682 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4118683 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4118684 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4118685 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4118686 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4118687 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4118688 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4118689 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4118690 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4118691 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4118692 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4118693 demand from most of our existing clients continued to rise and a number of newly acquired customers in the past year have been expanding the scope of their outsourcing assignments to us after our successful completion of the pilot projects

4118698 we want to provide them with marketing and public relations that will add to and highlight their success
4118699 but what will happen if these kinds of acts continue is that ngos will be forced to downscale reduce the scope of their activities and ultimately the only people who will suffer are the afghans who rely on the support the ngos are providing
4118700 to discuss their concerns and to offer support to ensure the continuation of programmes and projects so desperately needed by so many vulnerable communities
4118701 in regards to the suspect we can confirm he was an hourly employee at the conway arkansas sic target store since november 2006
4118702 he voluntarily quit his job earlier this morning he had no history of behavioral or performance problems at target in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4118703 there was a large amount of ammunition found inside the house consistent with some of the weapons the suspect had down in grant county
4118704 while running mates typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights he eludes ideological labels a roman catholic he opposes both the death penalty and abortion yet has allowed several executions during his tenure as governor and says he does not think abortion should be criminalized he describes himself as pragmatic not partisan a bridge builder
4118705 i think hillary clinton has been very gracious i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4118706 bayh adds virtually nothing to obama and would present a number of significant drawbacks biden is just the opposite
4118707 for obama whose only obvious weakness in the race is his light foreign policy resume biden would provide an immediate boost and badly complicate john mccains attempts to paint the illinois senator as ill prepared to represent the united states on the world stage
4118708 as of wednesday evening they were about 99 100 short of their stated goal
4118709 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4118710 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4118711 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4118712 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4118713 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4118714 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4118715 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4118716 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4118717 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4118718 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take

4118725 the institution of slavery and the presence and personhood of those enslaved and of legally free african americans are either completely erased or extremely minimized

4119045 the decision of the government on the recommendations of the sixth pay commission is not fully satisfactory to employees
4119046 though the pay fixation formula and rate of increment have marginally been improved it is still less than what was demanded by the staff unions
4119047 we are really disappointed because our suggestions have not been accepted including minimum wage of rs 10 000 5 per cent rate of incremen t as in case of psus making 40 per cent fitment
4119048 there is a sharp disparity between fitments of 12 per cent to 180 per cent among the pay scales moreover the minimum wage and maximum wage ration has increased from 1 10 to 1 14 which is not acceptable
4119049 the government needs to review this as the gap between the pay of the lowest and highest member of hierarchy has increased drastically this time
4119050 with the elections coming near day by day this is the best done for the central government employees
4119051 i have worked hard under my coach former olympic champion mac wilkins and that helped me improve a lot i hope it shows tomorrow

4119066 we probably shouldnt have but we read all of that stuff
4119067 there have been times when weve been doing the olympics where guys will come from the swimming pool with the gold medal around their necks and theyre still wet and they walked over and theyre just in a daze

4119081 todays children are no longer interested in the ancient myths they prefer modern heroes like spiderman or sponge bob
4119082 heureka theseus i have an idea we implement your story with the minotaur as a computer game what do you say
4119083 perfect then now theseus your task is to implement the game
4119084 we have a two dimensional labyrinth whose corridors can point in many directions of course we can abstract from the detailed lengths and angles for the purpose of finding the way out we only need to know how the path forks to keep things easy we model the labyrinth as a tree this way the two branches of a fork cannot join again when walking deeper and the player cannot go round in circles but i think there is enough opportunity to get lost and this way if the player is patient enough he can explore the entire labyrinth with the left hand rule
4119085 mh how to represent the players current position in the labyrinth the player can explore deeper by choosing left or right branches like in
4119086 but replacing the current top of the labyrinth with the corresponding sub labyrinth this way is not an option because he cannot go back then
4119087 ah we can apply ariadnes trick with the thread for going back we simply represent the players position by the list of branches his thread takes the labyrinth always remains the same
4119088 for example a thread turnright keepstraighton means that the player took the right branch at the entrance and then went straight down a passage to reach its current position with the thread the player can now explore the labyrinth by extending or shortening it for instance the function turnright extends the thread by appending the turnright to it
4119089 to access the extra data i e the game relevant items and such we simply follow the thread into the labyrinth
4119090 unfortunately if we want to extend the path or go back a step we have to change the last element of the list we could store the list in reverse but even then we have to follow the thread again and again to access the data in the labyrinth at the players position both actions take time proportional to the length of the thread and for large labyrinths this will be too long isnt there another way
4119091 well i uhm i need some help with a programming problem im programming a new theseus amp the minotaur computer game
4119092 yet another artifact to glorify your heroic being and you want me of all people to help you
4119093 ariadne please i beg of you ancient geeks inc is on the brink of insolvency the game is our last hope
4119094 huh what does the problem have to do with my fly
4119095 nothing its a data structure first published by g rard huet
4119096 more precisely its a purely functional way to augment tree like data structures like lists or binary trees with a single
4119097 i know for myself that i want fast updates but how do i code it
4119098 dont get impatient you cannot solve problems by coding you can only solve them by thinking the only place where we can get constant time updates in a purely functional data structure is the topmost node
4119099 but then the problem is how to go back because all those sub labyrinths get lost that the player did not choose to branch into
4119100 well you can use my thread in order not to lose the sub labyrinths
4119101 wait how would i implement this behavior as a function turnright and what about the first argument of type a for turnright ah i see we not only need to glue the branch that would get lost but also the extra data of the fork because it would otherwise get lost as well so we can generate a new branch by a preliminary
4119102 now we have to somehow extend the existing thread with it
4119103 indeed the second point about the thread is that it is stored
4119104 aha this makes extending and going back take only constant time not time proportional to the length as in my previous version so the final version of turnright is
4119105 that was not too difficult so lets continue with keepstraighton for going down a passage this is even easier than choosing a branch as we only need to keep the extra data
4119106 but the interesting part is to go back of course lets see
4119107 if the thread is empty were already at the entrance of the labyrinth and cannot go back in all other cases we have to wind up the thread and thanks to the attachments to the thread we can actually reconstruct the sub labyrinth we came from
4119108 note that a partial test for correctness is to check that each bound variable like
4119109 well i would have called it ariadnes pearl necklace but most likely its called zipper because the thread is in analogy to the open part and the sub labyrinth is like the closed part of a zipper moving around in the data structure is analogous to zipping or unzipping the zipper
4119110 as if your thread was any help back then on crete

4119115 dispatchers should not be subject to discipline for using their judgment to help the captain determine the appropriate fuel load for a given flight
4119116 any attempt by airline management to inappropriately influence or intimidate dispatchers is extremely misguided
4119117 in 2007 american flights had more than 600 gallons above and beyond what the fars federal air regulations require
4119118 concerned about what appears to be a drive toward minimum standards by our airline and others until now american airlines has never been an airline that has been satisfied with meeting only federally mandated minimums
4119119 we dont fuel to minimum requirements we have policies and procedures in place that exceed those minimums
4119120 archaeologists announced that the burial in the main chamber of the large rich tomb was that of philip ii father of alexander the great who was assassinated in 336 b c
4119121 regarding the paraphernalia we attribute to alexander no single item constitutes proof but the quality of the argument increases with the quantity of information
4119122 we believe that it is likely that this material was alexanders as for the dating of the tombs themselves this is virtually certain
4119123 andronikos presented his theories that the tombs were those of alexanders father and his family with great skill and the greek nation responded with fervent enthusiasm
4119124 indeed i was one of those who in two early articles in the late 1970s accepted andronikos view that the remains were those of philip ii
4119125 the earliest securely dated barrel vault in greece dates to the late 320s b c nearly a generation after the death of philip ii
4119126 we have several surviving coins issued in his own lifetime showing alexander holding what appears to be a scepter of about that height
4119127 once we have determined on archaeological grounds that tomb ii is a generation later than philip iis death we can then ask whose tomb is it
4119128 we have a double royal burial from this era attested in the ancient literature thus the tomb is that of alexanders half brother philip iii arrhidaeus and his queen adea eurydice
4119129 tomb i is from the age of philip ii unlike the big chamber tombs which are later and the human remains of the three burials accord well with the assassinations of these individuals
4119130 indeed for most scholars working in fourth century macedonia the original attribution by andronikos now seems doubtful
4119131 lets hope the suspicion is unfounded that fascism is resurfacing in our country under another guise
4119132 some people have been detained and the investigation is focusing in the direction of extremist fundamentalist elements
4119133 there could be remnants of fatah al islam or those cooperating with it and linked to al qaeda

4119169 our model makes an apples to apples calculation of the actual dollar contributions required for a db and dc plan to achieve the same target retirement benefit
4119170 the efficiencies of db plans already are well documented this report however is important in terms of quantifying the magnitude of those efficiencies

4119228 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4119229 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in a position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on we find that unacceptable and we are going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future

4119264 were unhappy with what happens when you come home and thats a much larger problem
4119265 it has to do with the uneven nature of medicare in canada and how some provinces seem to excel at it and other provinces dont provide the same quality of it
4119266 but its fundamentally unfair to push the wounded soldiers and already over stressed families onto an already overburdened civilian health care system
4119267 there has to be some sort of inclusion for the long term care costs of rehabilitation and psychological care for the soldiers when theyre in uniform and when they come out of uniform
4119268 the federal government should ensure there are regional centers at a minimum that would provide for the care and the rehabilitiation

4119284 i would describe my practice as an interdisciplinary design studio with a strong conceptual approach

4119286 when my father bought a zx spectrum in the mid 80s koen one of my earliest friends and i started connecting lego to it
4119287 i built robots and thought about applications koen programmed the code in the early 90s we became intrigued by the demo culture an early form of computer art which was mostly text scrolled over the screen to show the capacity of a computer we designed the typefaces ourselves and let them dance over the screen the music we ripped from games we stole music even before mp3s existed the biggest problem was what to write about so most of the time we wrote the names of our friends or let the computer speak as if it was a human itself this approach has never changed i still like to make things and want to let the things speak for themselves
4119288 we teach a course that follows the principles we use in our own daily practice
4119289 what we dont teach is how to design a website we want the students to be aware that they are becoming designers in a world where technological development shapes our lives they are designing at a time when information flows as a continuous stream that is changing constantly in such a time we believe it becomes more important to design the systems that hold the information we want students to think about designing or developing tools that can be used in a creative process in other words they should think of the frame within which others can operate where others have the liberty of creation
4119290 the important criteria were that the audience at the opening would be able to witness the whole shoot and that the video clip would be added to the exhibition immediately after the shoot
4119291 this meant that we had no option to reshoot or edit if something went wrong which made the whole crew so focused that we performed even better than any of us could have imagined

4119312 heck yeah you can have hampsters if it only costs me 5 and there is virtually no maintenance involved
4119313 anything to give us some form of clue as to the origin of this threat
4119314 for all we know this is nothing more than a nightmare caused by bad food
4119315 what about the fact this only happens when his sharingan changes and he stops breathing
4119316 whos to say that abomination inside you want turn evil like the kyuubi and decimate our village
4119317 whether or not this threat is real or imagined domestic or foreign vigilance is the key to our survival we have had peace for several years but unfortunately peace is a fleeting thing that is maintained by the shed blood of shinobi and soldier alike as several members of this council can attest to from personal experience the purpose of this meeting was to make the council aware of my vision nothing more
4119318 if thats all this was then it was a waste of time hokage sama fellow council members i will take my leave of you and attend to actual important matters
4119319 no offense taken he hasnt been my son for years dattebayo
4119320 kanaye is hate filled and hopeless wheeze trying to save him is a lost cause thank you ryuji kun for sharing your vision with us we will prepare now im tired i think ill go home wheeze
4119321 but please if you have another vision try to focus on anything that may be a clue we can use even the slightest thing could help
4119322 your father would be proud of you especially when dealing with trash like kanaye oh im sorry hana chan i dont mean to upset you
4119323 the man who did that to my brother upsets me i cant believe i ever loved hiashi why would a grandfather do that i still cant understand
4119324 we may never know other than the fact that hiashi was a bitter old man
4119325 it just becomes a serious pain in the neck when kanaye feels the need to remind us all of the power he holds after the war we had to rely on the hyuuga clan for strength and even now they make up nearly half of all konohas forces but i dont have to tell you that also ryuji kun do not forget about the anbu training you scheduled this afternoon
4119326 however is there any word of when dad might come back
4119327 no son i havent heard anything from your father yet but then again it does take time for messages to travel back and forth to the land of demons
4119328 although i did hear your sister reached suna this morning and hopefully she will be able to find a cure to kaiyas sickness
4119329 or at least i hope she can for narukis sake if no other
4119330 we all do at the very least she has all my notes on the matter to help
4119331 now if youll excuse me i have dull hokage things to deal with sigh all day long
4119332 well all in all i dont think the meeting went that bad
4119333 what if it is all imagined what if this is some side effect of me developing a new sharingan
4119334 there are a lot of unanswered questions and we cant dwell on possibilities but we can prepare you said you had an anbu training session this afternoon so why dont i train with you
4119335 no im not because i was never offered the position
4119336 i have never even led or trained a genin team
4119337 you have successfully completed 23 s ranked missions 74 a ranked missions 231 b ranked missions
4119338 your mom is right he flaunts his power and hes used it against me among others
4119339 he is the head of the hyuuga clan the hyuuga clan makes up a third of the council and kanaye has used his influence to persuade enough of the others to give him a majority vote the only council members who do not side with him are shikamaru kiba choji shino our dads and the hokage
4119340 after he denounced me as a member of the hyuuga clan i became open sport for them then there is the fact of kiyobi even though my dad did not stand for ridicule of any kind against me there was nothing he could do to change the fact no one trusted me
4119341 despite the fact daddy struggled to make everyone acknowledge him and kept his word to become hokage people still judge me because of her
4119342 no one trusts her despite the fact we defended konoha during the war despite the fact we have completed so many missions its all because of my brother dad couldnt remove kanaye as head of the clan but instead had to protect his position to maintain stability so my brother has used that net of protection along with his position and hatred to weave dissention
4119343 he turned the people against you with subtle rumors and well placed lies
4119344 he convinced the people their children would be in harms way if you led a team and that it would be disastrous if you were apart of one thats why all your missions were solo missions and why you were never offered a position in the anbu my father was right when he said no one will hurt you or betray you like a family member
4119345 you will join the training this afternoon as an anbu member
4119346 there is a rule that states as leader of the anbu i can appoint members who i deem are more than qualified for the job and after seeing your service record with my own eyes i would say you are over qualified
4119347 i will not let your brother hold you back anymore and i will not let you sit idly by on the side lines either you are going to show these weak willed villagers the strength flowing through your veins the strength of uzumaki hana
4119348 why would you risk so much for me if kanaye finds out he could have you removed from your position
4119349 naruto how the hell did you see that coming and i didnt
4119350 of course besides they have a new super sized ramen bowl with lobster crab beef shrimp and pork called meat of heaven i want to try
4119351 alright but do you think they will be okay i mean shes older than he is
4119352 are you kidding im just happy my little girl will finally have someone who doesnt listen to kanaye and will give her a chance dattebayo
4119353 your son is an honorable man just like his father
4119354 well comparing kaiyas symptoms with my mothers notes gives me the indication that kaiya is in the early stages of the disease
4119355 with it being in the early stages gives us about five months not trying to sound morbid
4119356 well in my mothers notes she references several treatments that showed promise but really had no effect because the disease was too far advanced
4119357 i will start with those treatments first and we will go from there now if someone can show me to the medicinal greenhouse i can get started
4119358 like crap cough but as long as youre with me cough cough i know we can beat this
4119359 i promise you kaiya my beloved we will find a cure
4119360 i will find a cure i will save you dattebayo

4119367 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
4119368 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4119369 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4119370 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent

4119429 the obama campaign is going to have to decide if they are going to go after this who is going to do it and to what extent they are going to do that because they have to be careful not to blow it up
4119430 obamas campaign has to absolutely make sure they can respond to every charge and make sure they have all the research on this because the lack of this research was an enormous impediment to responding to the ads and the swift boat book

4119479 not realistic for the united states or almost any other country
4119480 its going to be very challenging to achieve that goal in that period of time so much of the energy issue that the united states deals with and the world deals with people i think do not have an appreciation for the lead times that are required
4119481 an integrative set of solutions and you have to undertake them all so when the whole debate focuses around we have to choose this one solution or that people are missing the point
4119482 for people or policymakers to pick one as being the winner is really shortsighted
4119483 should be developing again all the supply sources and all the options that we can develop
4119484 consistent with ongoing structural change and making the industry more export oriented and open
4119485 it will make sure that australias credentials as a country committed to trade liberalisation are supported
4119486 balancing the needs of the industry internationally and the need to be export oriented
4119487 it also addresses the need to allow structural change to take place and to allow the industry to adjust to the impact of climate change by greening the industry

4119498 the important thing is not the official cash rate but what the level of interest borrowers are paying
4119499 our view is that their implementation of the account switching package is really not good enough
4119500 industry has followed the path of least resistance to get in place a package that meets the treasurers requirements with the least amount of effort possible
4119501 come november there is going to be this package in place and it does mean multiple physical trips to the banks and no guarantee that all your direct debits will be switched you the customer still bear all of the risk
4119502 if the government doesnt follow through on that report and actually do something that account switching package has no teeth
4119503 choice warmly welcomed our package in february and have been participating in constructive discussions since then so their comments are somewhat surprising
4119504 we would expect choice to look favourably on any attempts by the government to help families make the banking system work for them not against them which is what our initiatives will do

4119527 t here is a ground swell among the players that masterson should start i found it interesting that two national league scouts both said he reminds them of kevin brown and a young darren dreifort because of his sinker
4119528 i realize that t his is a very brief window but one national league team that does defensive ratings like red sox and indians has lowries defense ranked 5th among the 62 major league shortstops
4119529 i dont think players were angry because so many of them like manny off the field but what happened was that he became a distraction and players dont like answering questions about other players when those players wont answer the questions themselves
4119530 i am told that as long as brian cashman is the gm and hank steinbrenner is owner manny will not be going to the yankees their plan is to take the money they have stashed away and go after cc sabathia

4119532 my guess is that theyll make a run at jarrod saltalamacchia in texas or mike napoli with the angels but they may have to forge some kind of platoon with someone like brian schneider and hope that the next couple of years they can develop a mark wagner or a luis exposito

4119573 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
4119574 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4119575 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4119576 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
4119577 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent

4119584 telah tetap bagi laki laki dan wanita yang sudah lanjut usia dan tidak mampu berpuasa serta wanita yang hamil dan menyusui jika khawatir keadaan keduanya untuk berbuka dan memberi makan orang miskin setiap harinya
4119585 adapun keadaan keadaan puasa rasulullah datang ke madinah menetapkan puasa selama tiga hari setiap bulannya dan puasa asyura kemudian allah mewajibkan puasa turunlah ayat
4119586 artinya hai orang orang yang beriman diwajbkan atas kalian berpuasa
4119587 berbuka dan gantinya memberi makan satu mud gandum setiap harinya kepada seorang miskin
4119588 seorang wanita hamil dan menyusui boleh berbuka dan tidak mengqadha
4119589 berbukalah dan berilah makan orang miskin setiap harinya dan tidak perlu mengqadha
4119590 al baqarah 184 dan allah menjelaskan makna gugurnya puasa bagi yang tidak mampu menjalankannya dalam firman nya
4119591 al baqarah 184 maka jelaslah bagi kalian bahwa wanita hamil dan menyusui termasuk orang yang tercakup dalam ayat ini bahkan ayat ini adalah khusus untuk mereka

4119595 we have no interest in acquiring airports we will not be acquiring stansted airport but clearly we will be happy to work with anybody who buys it
4119596 its the same offer we made to the baa five years ago
4119597 weve offered to build a second terminal in stansted in the past and double the traffic but the baa told us to go away
4119598 the only way airports make money is to build passengers numbers
4119599 i cannot allow these delays to impact on the care of those vulnerable adults and children who rely on health and social care services
4119600 these new arrangements are to be introduced as a temporary measure
4119601 you could do without a weekend break but replacing your summer holiday is very difficult
4119602 what do you do stay at home if you look at the weather it is a different experience
4119603 if you are working to a budget then it is attractive that costs for drinks children and water sports are included
4119604 we are encouraged that management has taken steps to ensure some resilience to changes in demand in the future capacity reduction and fuel hedging combined with the merger synergy benefits provide some reassurance that the group will be able to cope with a downturn
4119605 we are probably one of the best hedged companies out there
4119606 while we are encouraged by these early results we are increasing our flexibility to give us the levers to pull in tougher market conditions including fuel price hedging and capacity management in all our markets
4119607 our proposal is a response to the changes our business is facing and the highly competitive nature of the market we operate in we are seeking to secure alternative roles for colleagues based on their experience and the roles available
4119608 if fewer people are moving house then they are less likely to purchase new fridges and washing machines that fit into their new space
4119609 benefit consumers by providing easy seamless and convenient travel to more global destinations with better connections improved flight schedules and enhanced frequent flyer benefits
4119610 it will improve customer choice by enabling the oneworld global alliance of which american ba and iberia are key members to compete more effectively around the world with other global alliances
4119611 bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4119612 by working together to provide links for connecting passengers the airlines can expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4119613 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4119614 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4119615 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4119616 we are applying for eu us anti trust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4119617 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world
4119618 it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4119619 this deal is good news for consumers who will now have more choice i dont see it leading to higher prices and i think it will increase competition on transatlantic routes
4119620 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4119621 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed open skies has not delivered the greater competition that was promised because heathrow is full
4119622 ba aa and iberia would still be unacceptably dominant with nearly half of all of the slots at heathrow leaving competitors powerless to take them on
4119623 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
4119624 akal sem primerno ponudbo iz tujine medtem je uprava dom al stopila v stik z menoj in hitro smo se dogovorili za sodelovanje odlo il sem se da se vrnem v slovenijo

4119627 dont wait for extraordinary opportunities seize common occasions and make them great weak men women wait for opportunities strong men women make them
4119628 i focus more of my time on seeking solutions rather than staying absorbed in the problem
4119629 its never happened in the history of our program to my knowledge
4119630 it says everything because the bottom line is the players vote they know she exudes everything about what iowa field hockey stands for on the field and off the field
4119631 the team needs something that comes from leadership and brings it together at times when we need a boost
4119632 carolines the epitome of a team player sometimes to a fault
4119633 she will put the team first almost all the time her everyday presence leads the team ive been encouraging her to take on ownership of herself i think what the team needs most from her this year is for her to be the best player she can be
4119634 we were there to get better for iowa and to get better for ourselves but we also knew there were a lot of athletes that were looking to complete their olympic dream and we needed to play for them too it was an awe inspiring mood
4119635 there is some sadness knowing that this is my last season but im excited at the same time
4119636 its an honor to be back for a fifth year the joke on the team is that i always wanted to stay at iowa longer than four years but i didnt necessarily mean this way the team is great its an awesome group of people but there is that sense of sadness the past five years have had a huge impact on my life
4119637 it proved why i came to iowa in the first place i discovered that even if i wasnt able to play field hockey i would still want to be here the day the injury happened it was clear that i was their first priority and that meant a lot to me the coaches were literally by my side the first thing tracey said was i guess youre here for another year that was the only thing i needed to hear at that point
4119638 one of the biggest reasons i came to iowa in the first place was the overall tradition and camaraderie of not only the team but the fans of iowa athletics overall it was something that lured me here and every time i step on the field is the same if not better
4119639 weve been building for this for a really really long time every single day we want to get better at something individually and collectively were trying to get better and that snowballs and prepares us for what we all know we want its a motivation tool for the present
4119640 we always dream big but we also like to think day to day and not get too far ahead of ourselves
4119641 theres an unspoken goal we have to be in the final four this year were not afraid to say it thats what we want and we have the tools to get there its entirely up to us
4119642 one of the biggest reasons i came to iowa in the first place was the overall tradition and camaraderie of not only the team but the fans of iowa athletics overall
4119643 it was something that lured me here and every time i step on the field is the same if not better
4119644 coaching field hockey at the collegiate level has always been my top priority
4119645 i have a huge respect for athletes who understand the time commitment that it takes to be a successful student athlete
4119646 i was flying over iowa and i looked at my mom and said what am i doing out here
4119647 but i was here for about 20 minutes and i loved it the people here initially sold me and it didnt take long for the facilities especially the field hockey facilities to seal the deal its like one family out here i was going from one family to another
4119648 the only thing that went through my head was the entire year leading up to that
4119649 myself my trainers my teammates we worked really hard to get ourselves there it was an awesome culmination to the hard work that i put in that i drained out of my coaches and trainers especially it was a low to a high for me personally but it was an awesome high to a high for the team overall
4119650 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structure that the public can feel reassured about
4119651 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4119652 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4119653 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4119654 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4119655 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4119656 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4119657 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4119658 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4119659 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4119660 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take

4119668 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4119669 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 per cent
4119670 the six month survival rate was 100 per cent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 per cent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
4119671 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead

4119700 deutschland hat ein gutes team mit exzellenten drei punkte werfern
4119701 wir werden uns in cottbus nicht verstecken ein unentschieden reicht uns nicht wir wollen gewinnen cottbus muss schon sehr gut sein um uns zu schlagen
4119702 wenn die energie und lpreise die inflation und lebensmittelpreise in die h he treiben geraten die kunden unter starken druck
4119703 if something sounds too good to be true it is
4119704 we dont care as long as its proven to be fresh and very very rich in nutrients we want health health is wealth
4119705 er kommt bei der mannschaft gut an man erkennt seine handschrift wir sind berzeugt von ihm es war deshalb eine folgerichtige entscheidung
4119706 macht den spielern ihr beruf auch mehr spa daraus hat sich ein ganz besonderer geist entwickelt der uns durch die schwierigen phasen der saison getragen hat
4119707 tempo handlungsgeschwindigkeit umschalten darauf wird es ankommen und daran werden wir in den kommenden wochen arbeiten deshalb haben wir auch entsprechende testgegner ausgesucht west bromwich albion fc sc heerenveen valencia cf die spieler m ssen sich an die hohe qualit t gew hnen
4119708 jos hat nie viel gesagt aber wenn dann war es stichhaltig er hat einen guten einblick in den fu ball
4119709 da sieht man dass man kein bullenbei er sein braucht um ein team zu leiten
4119710 dass das team funktioniert eine basis besitzt auf dies es zur ckgreifen kann die sicherheit verleiht
4119711 dass man sp ter sagt die haben die klasse gehalten aber unansehnlichen fu ball gezeigt ich will beides
4119712 unser ziel kann es nur sein die n chste runde zu erreichen der fc eto gy r ist zwar f r mich eine gro e unbekannte trotzdem m ssen wir uns bei allem respekt vor dem gegner durchsetzen und die erste hauptrunde im uefa pokal erreichen
4119713 ohne den gegner zu untersch tzen aber diese aufgabe ist machbar
4119714 unsere zielsetzung ist ganz klar wir wollen in den uefa cup
4119715 while there may be young men on estates missing fathers who left them there are also children in middle britain whose parents become strangers in a culture of long working hours
4119716 in society the fetishisation of money and the growth of consumerism add new pressure
4119717 inequality plays its part as young men from poor backgrounds feel they have less to lose
4119718 why one boy asked me was i worried about his grades at school when he might not live long enough to get a job this is the world of get rich or die trying
4119719 the issue is one of self image in a warped world of gang culture carrying a weapon has come to be associated with being a man rather than being seen as a risk the knife confers respect

4119728 the healthy rivers action plan is a comprehensive catchment to coast approach to protecting the future of our rivers by improving water quality
4119729 the swan river is the very heart and soul of our community just like other rivers around the world the swan and canning rivers are susceptible to algal blooms low oxygen levels and seasonal fish deaths and these are exacerbated by the onset of climate change
4119730 the new turbolox unit will work more efficiently in the upper swan than its predecessor by adapting to river conditions to spread oxygen further it is essential that we continue to develop and adopt innovative technologies to deal with river water quality issues and oxygenation is just one technique we are using
4119731 i make that journey two or three times a week and the train is usually crowded but this time people werent standing just because there was no room all the seats and tables were wet
4119732 it wasnt just one window that was leaking none of them would close properly it was like being in the outside people were putting up umbrellas
4119733 everytime we stopped at a station the guard leapt out to try to get some tissue from the toilets to mop up the tables and stuff the paper in the windows to try to staunch the flow a bit
4119734 i go all the way to cambridge and it was a very difficult journey even worse than usual
4119735 the weather was quite exceptional on tuesday but we will be looking to see if anything can be done about the windows
4119736 the one coach trains that they use on that line just arent up to the job really passengers call them scuds and after this we could see why
4119737 they were greatly alarmed and immediately sought god for guidance
4119738 the care should include prevention early intervention targeted treatments for particular disorders an understanding of developmental processes and continuity of care
4119739 furthermore treatments should be accessible regardless of age gender sexual orientation disability race ethnicity and culture lastly evidence based practice should be cross disciplinary and include collaborations with families schools practitioners and researchers from various health fields
4119740 this is especially true for low income youth for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems ethnic minority youth and those with drug alcohol problems
4119741 despite much excitement generated by recent advances in the knowledge of brain development and function the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of depression as well as its amelioration by ad treatment remain poorly understood
4119742 this gaping wound in my chest is like reading your diary out loud
4119743 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4119744 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
4119745 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4119746 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
4119747 our findings support a role for nmdar dependent modulation of da neurons in cue induced relapse to drug seeking
4119748 our findings link nmdar signaling in da neurons with relapse behavior and provide a new rationale in the treatment of cocaine addiction specifically the selective activation of the glur1 subunit could potentially improve the outcome of any given exposure therapy
4119749 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
4119750 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4119751 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4119752 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4119753 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here
4119754 eucom forces will remain ready to support as further needs are assessed
4119755 in the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life
4119756 the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government
4119757 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4119758 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4119759 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
4119760 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area
4119761 this investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
4119762 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4119763 we are changing the way ocean science is done launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans
4119764 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter
4119765 sentry is a true robot functioning on its own in the deep water
4119766 the vehicle is completely on its own from the time it is unplugged on the deck and cut loose in the water
4119767 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4119768 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
4119769 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4119770 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
4119771 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4119772 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
4119773 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
4119774 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
4119775 clinical caspase activation in cll by gcs 100 a phase 2 study
4119776 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders
4119777 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
4119778 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4119779 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
4119780 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
4119781 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
4119782 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
4119783 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
4119784 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
4119785 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
4119786 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
4119787 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards

4119792 we dont hold the telephone company liable when two callers use the phone lines to plan a crime
4119793 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about
4119794 the president should come from a technology background and understand technology at a high level
4119795 it would be good if the person at the helm of the country had an appreciation of the changes taking place as we speak
4119796 we had artillery fire you can hear them shoot it i saw a lot of death dying soldiers
4119797 so when i came home yeah i had major sleep disturbances i was angry confused disillusioned
4119798 when you have ptsd you dont recognize that you got it you dont know whats wrong with you theres a lot dysfunctionality
4119799 heck yeah you can have hampsters if it only costs me 5 and there is virtually no maintenance involved
4119800 by the time any user was notified that facebook was at a minimum an observing party to the transaction and that facebook was asking for an approval to publicly broadcast identifying information regarding the event personally identifying information had already been communicated to facebook
4119801 thus non facebook persons who utilized the facebook beacon activated affiliate websites were not told that their transaction and indeed every transaction they engaged in upon the website was being communicated to a third party facebook with whom they had no relationship whatsoever

4119806 jorginho dungas teammate when brazil won the 1994 world cup in the united states was in tianjin wednesday to watch cameroons 0 0 draw with italy which secured the african team a second round berth and set up the matchup against the brazilians
4119807 but their biggest strength is their physical condition its a typical african team
4119808 it will be a rematch of the teams quarterfinal matchup at the 2000 sydney games when cameroon eliminated brazil 2 1 in extra time ronaldinho brazils top star in this years squad was a member of that team too
4119809 but now its the knockout stage and anything can happen we cant make any mistakes we need to be cautious
4119810 in 2000 cameroon went on to win its first and only title in a 5 3 penalty shootout against spain in the final coach martin ndtoungou will not be able to count on two regular starters against brazil at the shenyang olympic stadium suspended midfielder georges mandjeck and defender paul bebey
4119811 theres not much of a difference between winning and loosing the fact that you put in your best what gives you satisfaction and the fact that i did give that so i am happy
4119812 the indian olympics association and sports authority have their role to play they have played their part i am sure they can give a lot more for the indian sports and i hope that this gold medal will inspire them to work harder as well so that not just one but we come back with maybe 15 medals
4119813 theres a huge difference the difference is that every other country has a serious olympic programme unfortunately we dont until and unless we have as serious olympics programme supporting athletes right form the beginning from the grass root level we will not make progress so we have to have a serious olympics programme
4119814 todays student ministry model is in need of major repairs
4119815 this model of student ministry has allowed us to maintain very strong participation for the sum total of two years off middle school then we lose the first group on their way to high school the next group when they get their drivers license and the last group in the spring off their senior year the fact that most now sleep off hangovers on sunday mornings in the dorms suggests our model though well intentioned has generally been a failed experiment scripture research and observation by seasoned youth leaders suggests it is time for a new model
4119816 this idea has created a genuine movement in the evangelical community to which parents are responding
4119817 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4119818 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4119819 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
4119820 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
4119821 i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
4119822 the mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is often times it can be very beneficial to make a trial decision and then walk around with it for awhile and see if it feels like it is going to lead to i have practiced this numerous times in recent years and have found it to be massively helpful in determining if its the right decision or not but then successful leaders will then learn to condense this decision making system into personal short powerful axioms that they repeat often to themselves and others and aids them often in making more decisive decisions do you reflect long enough that you are aware of your axioms that god has been writing in you i have traveled the world with bill on many occasions helping him coach and mentor leaders and have watched him then in private settings wrestling with massive decisions and embodying these very principles that have resulted in very wise decisions what are you using to help you make the right call in the key decisions of your life gary haugen the president of international justice mission spoke on this was one of the most powerful talks i have heard in a long time he hit the ball over the green monster hit the long ball several key quotes that stirred me deeply and i will be reflecting on in major ways in the days ahead include are jesus and i interested in the same things
4119823 gods plan for making his goodness believable to a world that is oppressed and abused is us
4119824 if you want your leadership to matter lead in the things that matter to god
4119825 the eyes of god roam to and fro throughout the whole earth looking for those whose hearts are fully committed to him
4119826 even though i dont feel his presence i will seek to love him as he has never been loved

4119830 growers have always believed you can achieve significant production boosts without dramatically increasing corn acres
4119831 and while total planted acreage estimates decreased by 300 million harvested acres rose by 400 million signaling the rebound from the spring floods
4119832 while the weather in july turned almost ideal for corn throughout much of the corn belt the soybean crop continued to struggle with later plantings and uneven stands as reflected in the august crop production report
4119833 soybeans are now in the flowering and pod filling mode so a better assessment of the crops condition will be forthcoming in the september report
4119834 illinois was only off two bushels per acre but what was unexpected was that iowas estimated yield of 171 bushels per acre was unchanged from last year
4119835 in contrast to corn the yields in all but one of the top five soybean producing states which are the same states for corn are estimated to be less than in 2007
4119836 the soybean outlook still has plenty of time to improve the crucial pollination period for corn typically occurs in july while soybean pollination typically takes place in august

4119878 anyone can give a short speech but governor gilmore is committed to providing hours of service to lobbyists and other important republican vips these individuals are under a lot of pressure and knowing that they have a former governor of virginia to watch the door will allow them to relax and enjoy their convention experience

4119889 digital imaging for mammography at least when were looking at quality is at least as good
4119890 in some cases when we look at patients younger patients with very glandular or very dense breasts and peri menopausal or pre menopausal women that study did conclude digital mammography was the best choice
4119891 we are trying to minimize that impact by continuing to bring in locum support as we have for the last year for mammography
4119892 once we move to digital mammography then we can look at how we can transmit those images off island for further support there as well

4119932 russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
4119933 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of democratically elected government are at stake

4119961 lets hope the suspicion is unfounded that fascism is resurfacing in our country under another guise
4119962 the only fascism present in italy today are the brutal tones which antonio sciortino defended the editorial and said the magazine had no reason to feel chided by the vatican response

4119974 its the greatest venue in boxing with all the champions who have fought there
4119975 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4119976 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4119977 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4119978 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4119979 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4119980 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4119981 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4119982 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4119983 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4119984 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take
4119985 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
4119986 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4119987 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4119988 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4119989 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4119990 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4119991 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4119992 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4119993 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4119994 sen john mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits serious consideration despite his support for abortion rights
