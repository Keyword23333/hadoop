4060006 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
4060007 he was just spoiling everything he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
4060008 the whole thing makes the anheuser busch company look totally childish
4060009 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
4060010 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking their sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
4060011 from our perspective it was more of a conversation than a confrontation
4060012 in the heat of the moment they saw people stickering our products in a non uniform way all over the boxes and the bar codes so they may have acted emotionally there and asked them to stop
4060013 their point is this is my property and youre defacing it my point is its just a positive cautionary message and its the store owners property
4060014 we are not opposed to the message the method theyre using is what were not totally in agreement with
4060015 i think there are probably better ways to communicate underage drinking is wrong that are more long term methods
4060016 we feel if it prevents one child from drinking and helps one parent to be aware of the situation then it is positive

4060019 this is a very important moment for the birds as they take their first flights into scottish skies they will be facing many challenges in the years ahead and like others ill be crossing my fingers that they find their way and breed in the future
4060020 the sea eagle is one of the cornerstones of scotlands species reestablishment programme and it will be an incredible experience for more people to see these huge birds in their natural environment

4060041 were updating the ie 7 installation experience to make it available as broadly as possible to all windows users
4060042 google is excited to partner with ibm to provide resources which will better equip students and researchers to address todays developing computational challenges
4060043 in order to most effectively serve the long term interests of our users it is imperative that students are adequately equipped to harness the potential of modern computing systems and for researchers to be able to innovate ways to address emerging problems
4060044 the reason that were partnering with universities is that google is an engineering firm
4060045 were working with our academic partners to teach large scale distributed computing to students
4060046 you need to design your software to that it scales horizontally
4060047 in this age of internet scale computing the new evolving problems faced by computer science students and researchers require a new evolving set of skills
4060048 its no longer enough to program one machine well to tackle tomorrows challenges students need to be able to program thousands of machines to manage massive amounts of data in the blink of an eye
4060049 this is really going to benefit every entity that goes on to take these students
4060050 theyre all going to benefit from this change theyre all going to need it sooner or later
4060051 to train tomorrows programmers to write software that can support a tidal wave of global web growth and trillions of secure transactions every day
4060052 were made very small contributions to hadoop for this project and we obviously very strongly support the project
4060053 i was spoon fed baby food at school when all i craved for was steak
4060054 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4060055 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4060056 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4060057 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4060058 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4060059 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4060060 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4060064 as a natural course american companies would not look at pakistan
4060065 so we have to get them to look at us and once they do business with us and credibility is established they come back for more
4060066 pakistan started late but now is catching up very fast in software development
4060067 our u s office has to offer the same kind of relationship management as top notch u s companies
4060068 it depends on all its members responding to messages when one member wants to contact another beyond their immediate network in every case where i tried to contact someone two networks away i found the gatekeepers asleep so my messages were never passed along
4060069 to be very static the networks in place but im not doing anything with it partly because im not sure how to use it well i like having other people i respect in mine in the hopes that they will meet each other but that doesnt seem to be happening either
4060070 as your network grows the number of gatekeepers available to a given contact grows as well perhaps i have just been lucky but the ones i asked to pass on a referral have been prompt and helpful
4060071 almost daily anything from finding valuable information about a prospect to finding the next employee finding contacts in a particular industry geography and much more
4060072 in sum whether social entrepreneurs choose a nonprofit or a for profit vehicle often depends on the particular business model and the specific social needs addressed
4060073 die berufsspezifische beratung ist ein wichtiger gesch ftsbereich bei formaxx in den wir kr ftig investieren

4060083 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4060084 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4060085 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4060086 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4060087 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4060093 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4060094 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4060105 natuurlijk waren we liever een half jaar eerder geweest met de huidige economische omstandigheden maar in tegenstelling tot de vorige economische afkoeling is nu de vergrijzing op niveau de schaarste blijft wel daarnaastvinden de vacaturebanken alleen de actief zoekenden wij nemen ook de passieve groep mee een goede professional heeft al een baan maar staat misschien wel open voor verandering daar mikken wij op

4060111 wij beschouwen dit meer als een rss feed wanneer je je inschrijft geef je alleen je e mailadres en je naam je zoekprofiel kan je zelf opgeven als je iemand kent die geschikt is voor een vacature dan ga je naar de site je hoeft geen vrienden uit te nodigen

4060114 yeerr people die already leave them alone lah dont kacau them to ask for favours somemore they are your parents but you cannot always run to them and tell them to bless so amp so with better luck more wealth good health because they are only humans once they are on their long holiday a well deserved rests so stop bugging them can
4060115 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4060116 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4060117 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4060118 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4060119 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
4060120 the discovery that this protein called platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor pdgfr is involved in cmv infection suggests a new target for anti viral therapies
4060121 every hour the virus causes one child in the u s to become disabled
4060122 by understanding how cmv gets into a patients cell we can identify new and better ways of treating the infection or even of preventing it altogether
4060123 and this virus has been found in several forms of cancer particularly brain tumors
4060124 moreover this growth factor receptor has been known to drive cancer so our findings suggest that its activation by cmv may promote tumor growth if further studies verify this it could help us develop new ways of treating these kinds of cancers
4060125 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
4060126 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4060127 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
4060128 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
4060129 although it is an old scientific chestnut we must once again emphasize how important it is to support continuing basic science on tropical forests
4060130 there are very few psychologists whose work has made such a difference as his
4060131 schools of the 21st century and other community schools can be the salvation of schooling in america
4060132 these schools are working toward increasing student achievement which is first and foremost a function of whether children have had proper supports from early in their lives to promote their optimal development
4060133 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4060134 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
4060135 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
4060136 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
4060137 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4060138 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
4060139 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4060140 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
4060141 this study is important because it brings attention to certain vulnerable groups who are currently underserved specifically ex combatants who make up 30 percent of 3 2 million people
4060142 we hope these findings will be used to help the liberian ministry of health in writing their mental health policy
4060143 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
4060144 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
4060145 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
4060146 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
4060147 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
4060148 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
4060149 antibodies with dual reactivity to plasminogen and complementary pr3 in pr3 anca vasculitis
4060150 there are many unanswered questions about peyronies disease and our goal is to ensure patients and physicians have a one stop resource providing the information they need therefore we are dedicated to continually providing fresh content and resources to the visitors of menshealthpd com

4060157 being named to this esteemed list two years in a row underscores the vast efforts on behalf of our medical staff to provide exceptional care to our patients
4060158 we are fully devoted to our mission of providing world class care to our patients in the communities where they live and being recognized as a 100 top performance leader is a great honor
4060159 this study identifies superior leadership based on the success of hospital executive teams long term strategies for strengthening performance
4060160 these are true good to great leadership teams that have focused on better serving their patients and communities

4060169 our findings suggest that many former child soldiers may need more than interventions to reduce the mental health problems associated with surviving bombings and torture often they have to endure being stigmatized when they return to their home villages
4060170 these findings suggest that there is something else in addition to war trauma that is causing problems for the former child soldiers
4060171 one hypothesis is that the reintegration process puts added stress on them
4060172 i want a career that allows me to do evidence based research and provide mental health care to those in the most desperate need
4060173 the parkinsons and mental health education project has clearly identified the need for health and social care professionals to increase their understanding of parkinsons and related mental health issues the pds is keen to use this information to design a specific training programme to help professionals find practical ways to help their patients have the best quality of life and the upcoming conference is a good place to begin
4060174 fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy in the treatment of primary recurrent and metastatic lung tumors
4060175 the cyberknife systems ability to non invasively treat lung cancer with favorable local control rates and minimal toxicities make it an important tool in the fight against lung cancer
4060176 as demonstrated by our study this is particularly important for patients who previously had few or no other options because it gives them a chance for a positive outcome while maintaining their quality of life
4060177 can allow for reductions in planning target volume margins because of less movement uncertainty while maintaining the desired level of accuracy
4060178 with each year that clinical studies are completed and published we see physician confidence increase and patient demand grow dramatically
4060179 this increase in momentum for cyberknife radiosurgery worldwide is offering physicians a better way to treat lung cancer and patients a better option for a quick and complication free recovery

4060181 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time

4060183 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4060184 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4060185 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4060186 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4060187 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4060188 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4060189 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4060190 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4060191 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4060192 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band

4060195 er zijn nog geen vaste regels waaraan netwerksites zich moeten houden er is nog ruimte voor nieuwe initiatieven en iedereen zou zomaar het marktsegment kunnen domineren
4060196 de eerste maanden streefden we een vrij klassiek beeld van een sociaal medium na tot we doorkregen dat voor gebruikers n g zon standaardplek geen toegevoegde waarde meer had ze vonden het zelfs vervelend er ontstond profielsitevermoeidheid
4060197 om te overleven moet je je op een specifiek segment richten
4060198 ga op zoek naar een doelgroep als er n ding is dat web 2 0 ons geleerd heeft dan is het dat je je beter kunt richten op kleine doelgroepgerichte marktsegmenten
4060199 het hele profiel komt dan in een klein venster te staan maar gebruikers kunnen het uitvergroten door erop te klikken
4060200 we hebben nu zon half miljoen leden verspreid over de verschillende onderwerpen

4060203 we proberen sociale informatie te verkrijgen door de activiteiten van anderen te volgen
4060204 het is de eerste zoekmachine die door de massa wordt aangedreven en resultaten geeft op basis van wat ander mensen zoeken
4060205 bedrijven laten adverteren is het meest populair maar niet per definitie de beste methode advertenties combineren met premium lidmaatschappen lijkt het beste te werken
4060206 ik denk niet dat je tegenwoordig nog succesvol kunt zijn als je minder dan twee miljoen unieke bezoekers per dag hebt een sociale netwerksite die het van adverteerders moet hebben komt met minder echt niet rond wil je daarna echt succes hebben en geld verdienen dan moet je minstens vijf miljoen unieke gebruikers per dag hebben
4060207 bedrijven hebben geen enorme bakken geld en advertenties nodig om te overleven
4060208 the reduction in breast cancer risk was a surprise to us
4060209 we dont know how tibolone reduces breast cancer risk understanding its mechanism might point us toward new ways to prevent the disease
4060210 stroke is very rare among women under age 60 so although taking tibolone does slightly increase the risk for women in their 50s the benefits of treatment for bothersome menopausal symptoms would outweigh those risks
4060211 the potential benefits of direct and intimate customer relationships that social applications can provide are just too compelling for companies to deny nevertheless embracing the groundswell is tever deficiencies a business might have
4060212 but as consumers around the world increasingly turn to social technologies organizations cant pretend the phenomenon isnt occurring
4060213 i was blown away when i saw the millville tracks

4060216 we needed mavericks who are passionate about racing to do this
4060217 five years ago it was a dream a year ago we broke ground the community was willing to take the risk because it creates job opportunities and keeps the younger people here
4060218 im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a car that i could get out there and give it my best it was great fun running with those guys at the front it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car

4060232 das urteil st rkt die kologisch orientierten anbieter am strommarkt
4060233 dank dieser entscheidung bleibt die preish rde f r verbraucher die den gro en energiekonzernen den r cken kehren und zu konsequentem kostrom wechseln wollen sehr klein
4060234 so aber m ssen sich auch die gro en energiekonzerne die zugleich netzbetreiber sind einem fairen wettbewerb auf dem strommarkt stellen
4060235 wir gehen davon aus dass wir dank des urteils weiterhin viele neue kunden gerade auch von vattenfall gewinnen werden

4060243 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4060244 the russian troops drew their weapons the georgians responded in kind
4060245 what is clear is that the complete russian victory in this small but nasty war has created a new reality on the ground
4060246 not just in georgia but in relations between russia and the west
4060247 cel ce se simte izolat ca un strain printre straini si ca supravietuitorul melancolic al unei epoci defuncte in plina actualitate se simte prin aceasta solidar cu o alta cetate al carei cetatean este cu o alta patrie cu un oras invizibil cu o republica indepartata aceasta republica este un fel de prezenta absenta un altundeva aerian si vaporos un oras pneumatic pe care exilatul il intrevede prin transparenta si ca in filigran de a lungul agitatiei unui oras strain
4060248 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4060249 the russian troops drew their weapons the georgians responded in kind

4060256 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4060257 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4060258 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland
4060259 our military is only involved in a war of self defence against this war of the sinhala nation
4060260 we will liberate the north sooner than people even think when you need to look at a bigger target a bigger goal you need to make certain sacrifices down the line and these are the sacrifices and for these sacrifices we are not going to let them down
4060261 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4060262 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
4060263 thank you for this it really is time to start shifting gears i guess your
4060264 this is a free event no pawsox tickets needed it should be in the

4060274 john is still mulling over their relationship he likes to have some space before deciding it is definitely over but he may be too late if these rumors that she is dating a model are true he will be really upset
4060275 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
4060276 contrary to reports jennifer didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
4060277 who could have sex the longest i think thats an event i can do well in
4060278 and probably who could stay up the longest just so you know thats supposed to be funny even though i am serious
4060279 there was this young lady recently that i invited to a party but it was a party with just me and her you know what im saying and id made a playlist of all the songs that reminded me of her because most of them were slow we ended up dancing and then things progressed
4060280 bob wants answers about what has been going on max is keen to meet him and explain he only has his daughters future at heart but he has a tough job on his hands
4060281 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
4060282 bob cant get over the fact she did this on a whim
4060283 right now he doesnt want to see her but hes incandescent with rage and she is in for a huge talking to when they finally meet up
4060284 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realized it was becoming a problem
4060285 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs
4060286 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4060287 its awful i cant tell you you dont know when it is going to stop
4060288 thank goodness people are starting to see the hypocrisy of it all
4060289 i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around

4060299 sidi ould cheikh abdallahi was his creature abdelaziz was the one who pushed him to the front of the political scene
4060300 and when you see him talking in arabic or french you certainly dont get the impression hes particularly brilliant
4060301 its obvious he has no vision no plan for what happens now
4060302 he must know the international community and most of mauritania doesnt want him to stay so he will think about it and find a way to get out without humiliating himself
4060303 one friend brings me something to eat twice a week sometimes people give me a bit of money as well but i dont ask anyone for anything
4060304 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4060305 the russian troops drew their weapons the georgians responded in kind
4060306 what is clear is that the complete russian victory in this small but nasty war has created a new reality on the ground
4060307 not just in georgia but in relations between russia and the west
4060308 it was put to him the items were stolen they included dvds cds a book and a shirt he said nothing over that he said he hadnt opened any packages and one package had been damaged by accident
4060309 he didnt set out to commit these offences he didnt intend to take items from royal mail with the intention of putting them on ebay the fact he had so many packages supports the contention that it was getting out of control
4060310 studying for six a levels was very difficult im not sure if i would want to do it again next year but im very relieved it has paid off

4060317 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief and we are determined to catch whoever was responsible
4060318 heyes agreed with the smoking ban he has not given us the chance to have a say in the matter im not a smoker myself but the smoking ban is killing the trade
4060319 he is only welcome back if he helps put it back to how it was before
4060320 that is tragic news let me get one thing clear i have not set foot in the prince of orange for eight or nine years
4060321 so its nothing to do with me as a regular i suspect its a stunt on the part of those who are opposed to the smoking ban
4060322 the majority of people who i know object to smoky atmospheres in pubs
4060323 the labour mp and trade union activist says his preferred drinking haunts in ashton are the oddfellows arms on alderley street and the broadoak hotel on broadoak road
4060324 we hope motorway service station operators will consider what more they could do to ease the pain at the pumps
4060325 meanwhile as we hit the peak summer holiday driving season and with fuel prices at current levels every penny counts
4060326 by spending a couple of extra minutes to come off motorways drivers really can be quids in by taking advantage of significant fuel savings
4060327 people are saying a record pass rate is a terrible thing
4060328 while some elements of courses are easier because students can retake modules students still have to do a lot of course work and perform well at exams in order to even pass their subject
4060329 i feel so sorry for our students because they want to celebrate what theyve done but theyre being told its worthless
4060330 it is a very positive picture and an accurate reflection of all the hard work that has taken place over the last year
4060331 we are very happy with the way things have gone the grades are going up every year but from what we have seen it because of our students hard work
4060332 during the investigation it became apparent that the registrant was holding morning surgeries on exactly the same basis as dr gray himself she was holding open morning surgeries on occasions when dr gray was not there or when he could not do it himself
4060333 we say the scope and remit of these open surgeries either held alongside dr gray or alone went far beyond anything she was qualified or experienced to do as a nurse practitioner
4060334 a lady came in with a prescription it was signed by dr gray despite the fact that i knew he was on holiday
4060335 the reason why i went across to the surgery was the quantity of one of the prescriptions was for one capsule there was no locum doctor on duty at that point i was told by the receptionist that the quantity should be 28
4060336 i was told that it was authorised by dr gray i was not satisfied with this because it was obvious dr gray was not on the premises
4060337 its a strain and im certainly not getting any younger
4060338 i have supported proposed changes to the 17th for ten years
4060339 i think this change could attract more visitors and hopefully extend the playing life of some of our members
4060340 the hill adds to the strain as the players have already played 16 holes and are tired
4060341 yes you have to walk slowly up it but i tend to do okay
4060342 nobody loves the walk but it isnt getting any steeper
4060343 i am however tibetan before i am dalai lama and i am human before i am tibetan
4060344 the difference between me being on the podium and not was four tenths of a point which is one landing
4060345 its my first olympics and i couldnt be more proud of my team and myself and how we did
4060346 i have no regrets i did everything i could today and i had fun
4060347 i needed to show what i was capable of at nationals and trials and all they saw was me falling
4060348 i had to prove myself here it definitely changed everyones perspective of me
4060349 i was looking at yang and thinking thats cool thats going to be me in four years
4060350 i want to get in the gym and learn new skills because its going to take every bit of time to get it done for london
4060351 going into these olympics i was shooting for the gold medal but to win any medal feels really good it feels like everything ive done over my career has paid off
4060352 the biggest thing over the next two days is trying to get as much rest and recovery as possible
4060353 tomorrows 200 im is going to be a hard race and so is the 100 butterfly against ian crocker crocks been waiting around for this event so you know hes going to be ready
4060354 shes an amazing athlete and its so exciting for team usa
4060355 everybody looks up to natalie and shes a great team leader
4060356 i was really fortunate to have them in my heat and to judge myself off of
4060357 we absolutely respect and admire michael but the feeling on the team is by no means does one man come first
4060358 the other night when lezak hit that relay guys on the team were bringing up the fact that if he didnt touch bernard out mike wouldnt have his eight golds but its honestly not something mike talks about
4060359 i think the biggest thing over the next two days is trying to get as much rest and recovery in my system as possible
4060360 ten months ago i was third at pan american games and that put me about 50th in the world nobody would have known who i was over these past few months ive been dropping time and now im right up at the top five ive put myself into world contention for the next few years
4060361 definitely the huge mistake i made four years by taking the preliminaries too lightly has been eating at me for a long time
4060362 for me to go out there and accomplish that medal im really excited obviously it doesnt top the relay from the other night but its something that its really pushed me to swim for four years
4060363 the momentum from the relay victory was great but physically it took a toll on me
4060364 im lucky i survived that im feeling a little tired right now ive got a couple of days of rest which is much needed right now
4060365 we all just tried to do the best we could and thats all you can ask for
4060366 a bunch of us are olympic rookies so we just gave it all we had
4060367 i dove in and they filled right up with water
4060368 it got worse and worse as the race went on at the 150 meter wall to the finish i couldnt see the wall i was hoping i was winning and hoping i would touch the wall first
4060369 u s a and waving american flags were drowned out by the deafening cheers of the hometown fans
4060370 its the ride of my life armstrong told the olympic news service
4060371 its what ive dreamed about since i was a little kid i had to stay focused on the descent and really push
4060372 we armstrong and poole were only four seconds apart on the climb
4060373 there was absolutely no damage to the aircraft our engineers confirmed it was safe to fly and we made sure our passengers still got to prague weather is very unpredictable but we have safety procedures in place to cope with any problems
4060374 what worries me is how many other times he has done it and i ask myself whether he has done anything even worse
4060375 i wont come into manchester any more unless i have to ive moved away from the area
4060376 its changed a lot you want to talk to people because you are scared its such a difficult area its embarrassing but it shouldnt be
4060377 im angry very angry with him hes obviously shown no remorse for what hes done hes not got a care for anyone i wouldnt be surprised if it got worse
4060378 be extremely cautious look over your shoulder if you are unfortunate and he does something to you get a good look at him if you can because the more people who positively identify him the more chance of getting him
4060379 people who know anything about this if they have any moral decency or standards should come forward if they can hes turned peoples lives upside down for his own sick enjoyment
4060380 i didnt notice anyone behind me i was speaking to a friend on my mobile at the time
4060381 i was walking down the road and someone grabbed me it happened quite fast i turned round to shout at him thats when i got a good view of him
4060382 people have asked why i didnt run but i was so shocked
4060383 these are very serious sexual assaults the victims have been very badly affected
4060384 three women have been attacked more than once typically he follows his victims and then lies in wait this man poses a serious risk we need help from the public
4060385 people should not worry about naming the wrong man because we have forensic evidence which can be used to rule out anybody else
4060386 i knew that my father transported hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of beechwood over long distances never however during the day but at nights and generally when the moon shone the reason for doing it this way as my father often explained was because water exposed to the suns rays is tired and lazy and therefore curls up and sleeps at night however and especially in moon light the water becomes fresh and lively and is able to support the logs of beech and silver fir which are in fact heavier than water
4060387 i saw a shadow fall out of the corner of my eye
4060388 then i heard a sickening thud almost like a crunch i glanced over and saw a body lying on the floor someone shouted that shed jumped off the roof so i ran out and yelled up to the security office
4060389 a woman came past with a little lad in tears and i heard her say she nearly landed on them
4060390 paramedics were here almost instantly by chance they must have been passing and got the call i dont know if she was still conscious but they whisked her off in an ambulance
4060391 the 41 year old suffered serious spinal and hip injuries and she has been taken to hospital
4060392 he has won every race he has been in he has the confidence and the drive to win and he is top on my list if he brings other factors also to bear
4060393 the sudanese yuriy and kamel have run 1 42s this season and i think that is pretty good
4060394 the race will be competitive and the winner may be the runner who controls the mind games better
4060395 the olympics are tricky mental toughness is important the race is not won by the best time or how strong an athlete is but how relaxed one is how well one executes his judgment
4060396 you make the right decision at the right time and you win you make a slight mistake and you are cooked and mistakes dont win medals
4060397 i lost the gold in sydney when i was at my best because of those simple mistakes
4060398 i was confident but my judgment was not right when an athlete kicks is paramount to his winning the race
4060399 the 2014 soccer world cup is very very important its the basis for the success of our organization
4060400 we organized the best pan am games ever at the olympics level
4060401 this continent hasnt had the chance to organize the olympics and paralympic games now its time were ready now its the moment
4060402 we are still a society with inequalities and the olympic games will help to reduce that
4060403 the 2014 soccer world cup is very very important its the basis for the success of our organization
4060404 we organized the best pan am games ever at the olympics level
4060405 this continent hasnt had the chance to organize the olympics and paralympic games now its time were ready now its the moment
4060406 we are still a society with inequalities and the olympic games will help to reduce that
4060407 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4060408 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4060409 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4060410 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4060411 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4060412 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4060413 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4060414 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4060415 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4060416 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important
4060417 and hes keeping the attention of the public he is a great athlete
4060418 you had jesse owens you had paavo nurmi carl lewis and now you have phelps and thats what we need to have
4060419 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4060420 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4060421 of course there are exceptions like in any other country some people are not satisfied that is true
4060422 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details
4060423 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4060424 it was really disappointing that doubles isnt in the olympics but at the same time it created a challenge to come back and medal im just ecstatic
4060425 the targets were jumping around and it was hard to see them and keep an eye on them
4060426 unlike the other shooters i dont have peripheral vision and i dont have depth perception because of my eye
4060427 ive overcome this with lots of determination and fighting spirit
4060428 i have a different strategy i stand back a little to get a better perspective
4060429 shooting in the middle position is the most difficult for me especially getting the targets flying from the left
4060430 it was really disappointing that doubles isnt in the olympics but at the same time it created a challenge to come back and medal im just ecstatic
4060431 the targets were jumping around and it was hard to see them and keep an eye on them
4060432 one of the saddest moments of my career we have to fix what went wrong and try to do things right
4060433 im much more experienced and its important that i can pass along what i know to the other players
4060434 im not really disappointed im just sad about it because before high bar i knew if i could just do the routine it was second place
4060435 i cant really tell why that happened i just tried to do the first flying element very soon near to the bar then i missed the bar with one hand and i couldnt hold it boom i just went down
4060436 for an athlete joy and happiness is temporary most of the time you have to be doing painful training
4060437 sometimes i would get really hungry but i was only allowed to drink water i would tell myself to hold on until after the olympics
4060438 a gold might have been a tad bit unrealistic for us
4060439 i think weve had a very consistent strategy over the last five to 10 years and weve stuck to that strategy
4060440 its a strategy that works in a really good market and its a strategy that works in a really tough market as well
4060441 being focused and sticking to that has been one of the hallmarks of our success
4060442 los testigos indicaron que el sospechoso pidi ver al presidente del partido ingres en el edificio y poco despu s se escucharon tres disparos de arma de fuego
4060443 flashback posttraumatic stress disorder suicide and the lessons of war
4060444 i thought i wont be able to get a medal therefore at that moment i didnt think anything except for continuing the competition
4060445 whether my parents are here or not it will not affect my performance
4060446 ello s lo servir para profundizar el aislamiento al que se dirige

4060460 one of the saddest moments of my career we have to fix what went wrong and try to do things right
4060461 im much more experienced and its important that i can pass along what i know to the other players
4060462 our perception is that we may be passing the peak of construction costs cycle
4060463 we will be retendering contracts to see if we can get some costs out as contractors become more eager to price business keenly
4060464 consistent with the evidence in the empirical literature the analysis in this paper has established a statistically significant effect of investment on growth in a sample of 33 african countries the evidence confirms that investment constitutes a key driver for growth in addition
4060465 while there may be young men on estates missing fathers who left them there are also children in middle britain whose parents become strangers in a culture of long working hours
4060466 in society the fetishisation of money and the growth of consumerism add new pressure
4060467 inequality plays its part as young men from poor backgrounds feel they have less to lose
4060468 why one boy asked me was i worried about his grades at school when he might not live long enough to get a job
4060469 this is the world of get rich or die trying
4060470 the issue is one of self image in a warped world of gang culture carrying a weapon has come to be associated with being a man
4060471 rather than being seen as a risk the knife confers
4060472 gracias a vuestras leyes democr ticas os invadiremos gracias a nuestras leyes religiosas os dominaremos los petrod lares que entran en las cajas de arabia saudita y de otros gobiernos isl micos son usados para construir mezquitas y centros culturales en pa ses cristianos con inmigraci n isl mica incluida roma

4060474 cada vez hay m s mujeres practicando deportes de pa ses como qatar o kuwait se puede elegir usar la vestimenta o no para m es liberador
4060475 la gente nos ve con los pa uelos y piensa que montamos camellos pero la mujer musulmana puede hacer todo lo que quiera

4060477 em portugal continuamos a brincar um bocadinho ao desporto continuamos a ter a sorte de ter uns cogumelos como algu m disse atletas que aparecem de vez em quando e que fazem resultados ptimos em alguns desportos
4060478 em portugal n o h por exemplo uma carreira nacional de treinador seria impens vel deixarmos de ser professores e deixar os nossos lugares nas escolas para nos dedicarmos exclusivamente aos trampolins s se fosse para rir
4060479 foi escrito foi dito pelos media que os trampolins s o uma das modalidades que n o se deve descartar em termos de atingir resultados de excel ncia quem escreveu quem disse quem inventou isso deveria ser responsabilizado
4060480 temos portugueses entre os 16 melhores do mundo em masculinos e femininos qualquer um deles pode ir a uma final
4060481 fizerem o seu melhor e n s fizermos o nosso melhor eles ganham
4060482 verdade que estamos entre os melhores do mundo mas dentro do sistema que est implementado em portugal estamos longe de ter as mesmas condi es que os outros ginastas t m nos outros pa ses
4060483 quando colocamos as fasquia l em cima a falar em n meros de medalhas a conquistar tudo bem um discurso ambicioso que fica bem mas pode depois dar nisto
4060484 o facto de muitos atletas terem vindo c lutar por medalhas e n o estar a correr bem para a equipa portuguesa
4060485 sinto alguma press o mas uma press o boa que me vai deixar um pouco nervosa naquele ponto de nervosismo que me faz bem me faz estar mais alerta para poder na competi o ter uma t cnica mais aperfei oada porque me sinto mais r gida e consigo saltar melhor
4060486 existem poucos lugares dispon veis para um n vel t o semelhante portanto muito dif cil atingir uma final
4060487 que os resultados apare am quer para mim quer para a minha modalidade quer para portugal
4060488 ich leide unter starken prellungen eine hand und mein r cken tun f rchterlich weh ich bin bers ht mit blauen flecken ich versuche mich so schnell wie m glich zu erholen um den m lilla grand prix nicht wieder wegen einer verletzung absagen zu m ssen
4060489 in der formel 1 habe ich gar nichts bewerkstelligt aber ich bin zu 1 000 prozent zufrieden
4060490 die formel 1 war immer mein traum wesentlich mehr als die nascar in meiner gedankenwelt habe ich das erreicht was ich in meinem leben erreichen wollte
4060491 pers nliche herausforderung ganz ehrlich wenn ich es nicht schaffe dann w rde ich mich nicht schlechter f hlen als wenn ich es schaffe w rde
4060492 ich wei dass ich nicht der beste nascar fahrer bin und wahrscheinlich auch niemals sein werde
4060493 ich bin mit dieser art rennsport nicht aufgewachsen klar besch ftige ich mich damit aber ich verliere den zusammenhang nicht hier betreiben wir entertainment
4060494 the art of interpretation is not to play what is written
4060495 i see divine origin everywhere in music the sea a flower a leaf an act of kindness in all those things i see the presence of what people call god the sounds created by a bach or mozart are a miracle that nobody can explain without thinking of something infinitely good something divine
4060496 poison put to sound a brutalization of both life and art
4060497 that was an interesting programme in one scene the cellist and a sort of hungarian composer zolt n kod ly are seen together with their great granddaughters at least thats what one supposes until one learns tat they are their wives and what were the two racy octogenarians talking about well they were saying that the trouble with me is that i must always be doing the latest thing but who are they to talk when they have been doing the same old thing for at least eighty years se or casals also offered us an interesting insight into his philosophy for example playing bach in the style of brahms
4060498 music must serve a purpose it must be a part of something larger than itself a part of humanity and that indeed is at the core of my argument with music today its lack of humanity a musician is also a man and more important than his music is his attitude towards life nor can the two be separated
4060499 casals respected furtw ngler not only as a man of integrity but as a fine musician so i asked casals if he would like to record brahms double concerto with
4060500 you will recall that i told you nothing would give me more pleasure than to record with furtw ngler i still feel he is a man of integrity however i am seen by my colleagues as a symbol of anti fascism and i would let them down if i played under furtw ngler they wouldnt understand

4060504 cellulosic ethanol is not a specialist thing its not for a few people here and there we believe well be able to mass produce this for millions of cars and if you use ethanol as a blend with gasoline which is how its most commonly used you could find almost every car is one day running on this
4060505 you have to do more than demonstrate that it can be done you have to show that it can be done profitably
4060506 they are usually offered for a reason a change in technology duplication of resources or cost cutting
4060507 the meeting indicated to us it was a cost cutting measure
4060508 it does indicate to me that there is an issue about service levels in country areas
4060509 theyre not sacking them but theyre not replacing them either
4060510 my concern is overall numbers will be less and we will still need to put those people on the ground to assist in the continued drought
4060511 there is no formal redundancy forced or voluntary program currently in place at dpi
4060512 voluntary redundancies are considered for those staff who express a personal interest in applying for them as has been the case since the dpi was established in 2004
4060513 running keeps you feeling good ive never had any problems with my health and have managed to remain injury free all my life
4060514 ive known people who have taken up running in their sixties and seventies so i think people of any age can run
4060515 you really have to listen to your body and dont push yourself too hard
4060516 i worked hard to get a better time than last year when i ran the race in 81 minutes

4060520 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
4060521 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas australian workplace agreements or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
4060522 we talked to him tuesday morning and hes very excited about all of this he cant wait for us to come he has all sorts of things planned for us but hes training too
4060523 he said everything feels great he says hes 100 ready hes going to bring home the gold
4060524 i want prove that they have made a big mistake
4060525 i do think they could have waited a bit i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

4060527 sidi ould cheikh abdallahi was his creature abdelaziz was the one who pushed him to the front of the political scene
4060528 and when you see him talking in arabic or french you certainly dont get the impression hes particularly brilliant
4060529 its obvious he has no vision no plan for what happens now
4060530 he must know the international community and most of mauritania doesnt want him to stay so he will think about it and find a way to get out without humiliating himself

4060534 based on unified assurances proven platform and architecture for next generation networks we are confident in our ability to support telstras next g tm network
4060535 the trend toward video streaming over the internet continues and we expect the rate of adoption to increase in approaching periods even in the present were seeing increasing evidence that streaming is becoming more mainstream a good example of this is the 2008 olympics in beijing where more people then ever before will be able to use their computers and cell phones to see events live or on demand any time of day
4060536 for the first half of this year weve continued to make progress toward stronger growth and expect this trend to continue in subsequent periods based on order flows continued high levels of marketing and sales activities plus fourth quarter product introductions we believe revenue growth at 20 percent or more for full year 2008 is attainable compared to full year 2007 in addition gross margins appear to be sustainable in the 65 percent range for the remainder of the year
4060537 most people go wrong because they fall in love with their own rectitude it keeps them from being practical
4060538 two front fight for democracy both at home and abroad
4060539 is that there is a little bit of the totalitarian buried somewhere way down deep in each and every one of us
4060540 youve got one song called lets impeach the president what is this song about
4060541 if you have a conscience you cant go through your day without realizing whats going on and questioning and saying is this right we have to be cognizant of the fact that we can make mistakes thats part of freedom we dont all have to believe in what our president believes to be patriotic no one george bush or anyone else owns the 9 11 mentality
4060542 im not in the least bit concerned i expect it i respect other peoples opinions thats what makes the united states and canada great is the fact that you can differ from your friends you can still sit down at the same table and break bread with your friend
4060543 its terrific hearing neil young speaking out on this very controversial subject and on the theme of what he said anybody who feels that the themes of this album are motivated by the need for publicity i think
4060544 from all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world but only these two the
4060545 life in a concentration camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths is it surprising that in those depths we again found only human qualities which in their very nature were a mixture of good and evil the rift dividing good and evil which goes through all human beings reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the concentration camp
4060546 the universal dividing line between good and evil runs not between countries not between nations not between parties not between classes not between good and bad men the dividing line cuts across nations and parties shifting constantly it divides the heart of every man
4060547 the pharisees in an attempt to discredit jesus brought a woman charged with adultery before him
4060548 he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone at her
4060549 neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
4060550 for the world is in a bad state but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best so let us be alert alert in a twofold sense and since hiroshima we know what is at stake

4060557 while we are pleased with our first quarter 2009 revenue performance which outpaced our growth rate for the fiscal year 2008 despite its reflection of historical first quarter seasonality we are disappointed with our overall financial results product approval delays and the may earthquake disrupted our products business during the quarter and we continue to feel the impact of this event in our product sales year to date despite these realities we remain optimistic about our prospects for the second half of fiscal 2009 and expect our products revenue and profit performance to be weighted heavily toward the later part of the fiscal year healthcare services revenue was lower than expected primarily due to a disruption in patterns of business travel and tourism in the months leading up to the olympics but we do not expect this to impact the divisions full year results
4060558 although the turnaround in the medical products division is taking longer than anticipated the long awaited sfda approvals are now in place and we have today announced the signing of our first da vinci surgical robot contract however earthquake disruptions negatively impacted our results for the first quarter and movement of freight through the transportation hubs of beijing and shanghai is restricted during the olympics which will negatively impact the divisions second quarter results as a result of these circumstances sales are significantly back end weighted for the year we now expect medical products revenue of at least 40 million for the second half of the year which we believe represents a more normalized baseline revenue expectation for the division we expect to report profitability in the division on a quarterly basis by the end of the current fiscal year
4060559 in the healthcare services division we believe this quarters results are seasonal in nature and we continue to expect an increase in annual revenue of approximately 30 over fiscal 2008 while inflation impacted our results this quarter we have navigated a variety of inflationary environments in our long history of doing business in china and we will continue to evaluate selective price adjustments when appropriate furthermore the chinese government has indicated it intends to take steps to slow the rate of inflation going forward we remain enthusiastic about our full year results

4060605 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4060606 sometimes homeowners just shut down and they dont do anything because they either think theres nothing they can do or theyre embarrassed

4060613 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4060614 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4060615 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4060616 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4060617 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4060618 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4060619 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4060620 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4060621 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
4060622 we face two urgent challenges both of which were responding to as part of planyc
4060623 first we have to shrink our carbon footprint to slow climate change second we have to adapt to the environmental changes that are already beginning to take place for example raise critical infrastructure like back up generators to higher ground in areas prone to flooding changes in the way we maintain and operate our infrastructure can help secure our city
4060624 the rockefeller foundation is proud to help new yorkers blueprint and build a more sustainable future as a part of our 70 million commitment to strengthen community resilience to climate change
4060625 this new york city panel on climate change will shape innovative approaches to cope with global warmings potentially devastating consequences in our hometown and model the kind of planning which can and should be applied in cities around the world
4060626 experts at columbia universitys earth institute are pleased to offer scientific and technical expertise to assist the city of new york with its climate adaptation plans
4060627 it is our hope that cities in the united states and around the world will use new york citys planning process as a model to respond effectively to climate change challenges
4060628 we look forward to building on the important work the scientific community has already done on these issues and helping new york city find specific solutions to adapt to climate change
4060629 new york city is well known as a vibrant place for aspiring artists and musicians and some of the most internationally celebrated musical performers of this century have had their start right here on our streets
4060630 its only fitting that the role new york city has played in launching the careers of so many of the worlds most talented artists like rock and roll hall of famers paul simon blondie and the velvet underground on the worlds greatest stages like the fillmore east the apollo theater and madison square garden be recognized and honored with the opening of the rock and roll hall of fame annex
4060631 establishing outposts like these is becoming a strategy of other major institutions
4060632 these projects allow museums to extend their reach but also provide space to travel exhibits and allow curators to display some of our priceless artifacts for the first time outside of cleveland
4060633 although there are more than 6 000 different languages spoken around the world music is the one language that we all share in common reminding us that we are all inherently the same
4060634 we partnered with the rock and roll hall of fame annex to help develop a cultural destination that captures the shared history of rock and roll and new york city and appeals to all ages and interests
4060635 new york city is home to talented musicians adventurous audiences and more than 1 400 extraordinary cultural institutions said cultural affairs commissioner kate d
4060636 we welcome the rock and roll hall of fame as a unique addition to the citys vibrant creative community
4060637 rock and roll is embedded in the history of our times and has changed the world around us
4060638 the rock and roll hall of fame and museum and now its extension the annex help us to illustrate in a tangible way musics impact on the cultural social and political history of the modern era
4060639 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
4060640 we should continue to push for a calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
4060641 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
4060642 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4060643 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4060644 we should immediately call a meeting of the nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4060645 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

4060651 this ban will add another layer of protection to prevent terrorists from obtaining the dangerous materials needed to bring harm to americans a ban on heu is a strong step forward in increasing our national security and preventing a nuclear terrorist attack
4060652 its absurd that the nrc has continued to drag its feet when it comes to banning this highly radioactive material
4060653 plain and simple banning highly enriched uranium for civilian use will remove another potential lethal weapon from the terrorists hands
4060654 you were not to do anything with ice or immigration and illegals whether or not they committed a crime even to arrest them because there will be the perception we are harassing illegals
4060655 stupid black men how to play the race card and lose
4060656 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4060657 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4060658 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4060659 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4060660 we definitely expect a slowdown in the growth of the tv market

4060696 what makes this store unique is the donations we receive
4060697 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
4060698 this is going to be the model of all of our stores
4060699 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
4060700 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much
4060701 our goal is keeping the stores well rotated and well stocked
4060702 a lot of residents have actually complimented him on his diligence in pumping water out of basements people seem to be satisfied
4060703 he couldnt give me a reason other than that he wanted to go in a different direction this year
4060704 why all of a sudden after 16 years are we replacing somebody
4060705 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is retribution
4060706 if you want to be the star football player this is not the school for you
4060707 this is for students and families who want something different
4060708 the opening ceremony i enjoyed but after that i didnt say another word or talk to anyone until the competitions began
4060709 sometimes you only have one shot and if you dont get it right your whole dream withers away

4060715 mr carosella had written to dr ender offering to help with a new theater company
4060716 when i met him i knew it was a great match we had the same vision for what we could do for the college
4060717 but its also fun and exciting and doors are starting to open
4060718 i said this might be the one time in my life i get to wear a tux
4060719 i took my granddaughter lauren patton up to see that and these 20 something fellows are standing there
4060720 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
4060721 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
4060722 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
4060723 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
4060724 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
4060725 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
4060726 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it
4060727 we were nervous about her we didnt want her to start swimming
4060728 we are adding all of this new space for one reason to make room for reaching out to men women and children who could use some of gods love and hope in their lives
4060729 the idea is to hit them real fast but only use five shots
4060730 the actual key to winning these games is not only shooting quickly and accurately but also changing gears in midstream and going from fast to slow thats the key
4060731 the top 25 people thats literally all they do is compete every year i have gotten better up here as i become a little bit more accustomed to it there is a lot of money and pressure
4060732 its a primer for new shooters they are just trying to promote firearms and it has really expanded

4060734 bour associates is no stranger to monroeville or pittsburgh as they provided the event planning and coordination for celebrate monroeville and have worked in the pittsburgh region on such projects as bassmasters the pittsburgh 250 celebration and the 2008 head of the ohio regatta
4060735 their expertise in managing successful events and conferences will be invaluable to the clientele of the cvb
4060736 it was strongly suggested by the council representative that given financial irregularities that apparently are over there it might be a good thing for a new board to be seated
4060737 the conventions and events currently scheduled for monroeville will be fully supported by the cvb and the interim management team
4060738 a significant number of your residents are not satisfied with how this has been handled
4060739 if mr campagna thinks there could be a conflict then 2 500 is a small price to pay to make sure everything is checked and balanced

4060741 take it to court and we lose every single penny
4060742 we are focused more on using data to drive instruction and for decision making
4060743 how do we educate a child who comes in with a myriad of problems from period one

4060745 the rigor associated with pre k counts standards will help them while they transition into kindergarten that helps when they go into pssas
4060746 we wanted to up the ante for wilkinsburg kids and set standards so that kids can get a head start
4060747 theyve been totally committed to the idea of pre k counts in the district and that made our jobs easier
4060748 weve had very good cooperation with teaching staff school board and administration without that collaboration none of this would be possible
4060749 i have to be at work at 8 a m if i have to take my children to different day care centers ill be late for work every day

4060752 i think that somewhere out there theres a solution thats just waiting to be found
4060753 its a compromise of some sort between the developers and the citizens what we perceive to be useful development as opposed to big box stores i would urge the council to take a little bit of time lets find that solution thats out there
4060754 you are in a very small group of vocal citizens against development
4060755 it is also very obvious that the group opposing this ordinance does not represent the future of murrysville by gauging the age of the attendees
4060756 wait and see i bet you will be doing more shopping in murrysville soon and enjoying it thank you for your input
4060757 a majority of the people youve heard speak against the overlay ordinance are not against development that may be something you feel we are against in total but that is not quite true
4060758 i think that theres been a misconception as to the amount of development i think that at least what weve seen proposed is an upscale shopping district with one anchor i dont feel that big boxes are going to be taking over murrysville
4060759 theres only two of our council members who pay any attention to the public
4060760 it was said to be a done deal a year ago and apparently it was they just basically ignored us for eight months
4060761 besting the 10 000 plus that were purchased for last years production of aida and we were pleased with last summers figures for that particular show

4060792 hubiera firmado un resultado como este antes del partido pero ahora estoy un poco decepcionado porque hemos tenido ocasiones claras para marcar y ganar el partido
4060793 me sorprendi un poco pero jugamos bien y el liverpool peor de lo esperado dimos lo mejor de nosotros mismos y demostramos de que est hecho el standard ha sido una desgracia que reina haya hecho un partido tan bueno pero tal vez tengamos mejor suerte en anfield dentro de dos semanas lo hemos hecho todo bien lo nico negativo es que nos vamos con las manos vac as es una faena pero no nos podemos quejar porque sigue siendo un buen resultado
4060794 fue una muestra de que est bamos jugando muy bien el hecho de que tuviesen que arriesgar sacando a gerrard convaleciente es relevante aunque habr a estado mejor si hubi semos conseguido marcar alg n gol
4060795 espero que podamos ganar nuestros partidos de liga porque nos dar moral de cara al choque de vuelta algunos dir n que pagaremos el hecho de no aprovechar nuestras oportunidades pero tambi n parec a que nos vendr amos abajo despu s de fallar el penalti y no fue as creo que tendremos nuestras opciones dentro de dos semanas

4060799 our only hope is to march to the throne of god and cry out the pain that lives in our souls my psalms are not finished anger and alleluias careen around within me sometimes colliding
4060800 si encajas dos goles en los primeros 20 minutos no puedes decir que has hecho un buen partido pero al menos es positivo el hecho de haber conseguido el empate a dos
4060801 estoy seguro de que mejoraremos nuestro rendimiento en el partido de vuelta porque antes disputaremos la supercopa y un encuentro de liga que nos har n coger la forma este resultado le da ventaja al steaua por lo que tendremos que ir a por la victoria en ruman a
4060802 nos sorprendi la velocidad con la que sali el partiz n en los primeros 25 minutos pero supimos reaccionar y comenzamos a llegar con peligro hasta que llegaron los goles obviamente no puedo estar contento con el resultado porque siempre tengo confianza en poder conseguir la victoria

4060839 sono veri e propri criminali coloro che offendono la dignit e la integrit di ogni persona umana soprattutto se sono bambine e donne
4060840 quanti tra le mura domestiche nei posti di responsabilit nei luoghi pi disparati e disperati di questo mondo alzano la mano contro le bambine e le donne sappiano che non avranno facile perdono e misericordia di dio i crimini contro la persona umana vanno denunciati e contrastati con una forte campagna di sensibilizzazione culturale e morale che deve coinvolgere qualsiasi istituzione soprattutto la chiesa non pi rassegnazione alla violenza n passiva sopportazione dei mali e delle offese che si consumano tra le mura domenstiche nei rapporti tra marito e moglie tra genitori e figli ma coscienza che il male morale e male fatto deve essere espiato e non nascosto per vergogna o per altre motivazioni di carattere sociale o di immagine la ribellione delle donne nei confronti di mariti violenti la ribellione delle bambine spesso molestate dai parenti e familiari deve emergere nella loro drammaticit per porre rimedio a questi gravissimi peccati ed abusi che gridano vendetta davanti a dio mi auguro ha concluso padre rungi che nel contesto della festa dellassunta anche i sacerdoti le guide e i padri spirituali i parroci i missionari facciano discorsi chiari da un punto di vista morale e non invoglino ancora oggi allaccettazione passiva degli abusi di ogni genere ma guidino con prudenza e sapienza quanti soprattutto donne e bambine subiscono violenze e che per vergogna non denunciano o non segnalano alle istituzioni competenti uomini mariti padri non sono padroni n possono abusare impunemente delle persone pi care pensando di farla comunque e sempre franca dietro minacce ricatti e condizionamenti di ogni genere e invece tempo nella verit che viene dalla morale cristiana del rispetto che si deve ad ogni uomo e donna della terra soprattutto se pi debole e fragile come le bambine e le donne che la chiesa gli operatori pastorali e le altre istituzioni presenti sul territorio non facciano finta dei drammi che si vivono in famiglia ma prendano coscienza dei gravi disagi morali personali e sociali ed aiutino concretamente quanti chiedono aiuto e che per altro sono tanti la vera devozione alla madonna ha detto padre rungi parte dal rispetto di ogni mamma donna bambina ragazza adolescente contrastando ogni forma di violenza in privato e in pubblico questo quanto ci chiede la vergine santa se vogliamo davvero essere vicino alle sofferenze di chi ha paura di dire apertamente come stanno davvero le cose nelle loro case e famiglie o negli ambienti di lavoro o di svago soprattutto in estate i terroristi delle nostre famiglie e dei nostri ambienti sociali vanno isolati condannati e fatti scontare tutte le pene che meritano in questi casi senza alcun attenuante
4060841 continua ha dichiarato simeone il progetto di fratellanza ed amicizia tra pignataro e sault due cittadine per lingue e per tanti aspetti diverse ma che vogliono assomigliarsi
4060842 katanya dia mau berdansa denganku kalau aku membawakan bunga mawar merah untuknya
4060843 ah sudah kubaca semua pendapat orang orang bijak dan semua rahasia para filosof namun tetap saja gara gara setangkai mawar merah hidupku jadi berantakan
4060844 setiap malam aku bernyanyi tentang dia meskipun aku tidak mengenalnya tiap malam pula aku bercerita tentang dia pada bintang bintang baru sekarang aku bertemu dengannya rambutnya hitam seperti kuntum bunga bakung bibirnya merah seperti bunga mawar merah yang diinginkannya tapi mukanya pucat seperti gading karena terlalu bersedih dan hanya memikirkan wanita itu saja
4060845 dan wanita idamanku diundang ke sana jika aku memberinya setangkai bunga mawar merah dia pasti mau berdansa denganku aku bisa memeluknya dia akan menyandarkan kepalanya di dadaku dan kami akan saling berpegangan tangan tapi aku tidak punya setangkai bunga mawar merah ia pasti tidak mau menghampiriku aku pasti sendirian disana melihatku pun pasti ia tidak akan mau dan hancurlah hatiku
4060846 persis seperti yang selalu kunyanyikan ia menderita apa yang menjadi kesenanganku malah membuatnay menderita pastilah cinta itu memang indah cinta lebih berharga dari zamrud lebih cantik dibanding mata kucing tidak bisa ditukar dengan mutiara atau buah delima bahkan tidak pantas dipajang di pasar tidak bisa diperjualbelikan emas pun tidak bisa menandinginya
4060847 wanita idamanku pasti akan menari dengan gerakannya yang ringan sekali sehingga kakinya tidak menyentuh lantai diiringi suara musik harpa dan violin
4060848 hanya satu tangkai saja apakah tak ada cara untuk mendapatkannya
4060849 hanya saja sangat mengerikan sehingga aku tidak berani mengatakannya kepadamu
4060850 kau harus membuatnya sendiri dengan suara musik di bawah sinar bulan dan kau harus melumurinya dengan darah yang berasal dari hatimu kau harus bernyanyi untukku sambil menusukkan durinya ke dadamu sepanjang malam kau harus bernyanyi dan duri itu harus membelah hatimu sehingga darah itu mengalir ke nadiku dan mejadi milikku
4060851 kematian adalah harga yang terlalu mahal untuk membayar setangkai bunga mawar merah
4060852 dan semua orang mencintai kehidupan lebih menyenangkan hinggap di hutan hijau memandang matahari yang berwarna emas memandang bulan yang berwarna perak lebih indah menghirup harum bunga bunga dan lebih indah mendengarkan lonceng biru yang tersembunyi di lorong lorong bangunan dan menghirup udara segar yang berhembus melewati puncak puncak bukit namun cinta lebih baik daripada kehidupan dan apalah artinya seekor burung dibandingkan dengan hati manusia
4060853 bergembiralah karena engkau akan mendapatkan setangkai bunga mawar merah aku akan membuatnya dengan dengan suara musik dan cahaya bulan dan melumurina dengan darah hatiku sendiri yang kuminta darimu sebagai imbalannya adalah kau harus menjadi kekasih yang sejati karena cinta lebih bijaksana daripada filsafat meskipun filsafat itu bijaksana cinta lebih kuasa daripada kekuatan meskipun kekuatan memang kuasa cinta memang sangat indah dan manis
4060854 katamu kau mau berdansa denganku jika aku membawakanmu setangkai mawar merah
4060855 ini mawar termerah yang pernah ada kau akan memakainya nanti malam sematkan di dekat hatimu dan pada saat kita berdansa bunga itu akan mengatakan betapa aku mencintaimu
4060856 aku beri tahu kau memang kasar sekali dan lagipula kau ini siapa hanya seorang pelajar aku yakin kau tidak punya sepatu perak seperti yang dimiliki keponakan pak chamberlain

4060860 we presented a short skit on gandhi for the cultural programme the script which was inspired by the film lage raho munnabhai showed how a young boy took up every challenge in his life with his gandhian approach
4060861 it was hilarious and yet had a subtle message for everyone especially amid such tense situations as in jammu and kashmir
4060862 we didnt have a cultural programme just the flag hoisting and a few speeches but the students put in all their ideas and creativity to make the entire event colourful and memorable

4060878 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4060879 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

4060885 repentance toward god and faith in the lord jesus christ
4060886 all you need to do is accept that jesus died and rose again ask him to be your saviour and you will go to heaven
4060887 let the wicked for sake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him

4060898 we hadden onze kerk liever op een mooie plek gehad maar dat is niet gelukt
4060899 het heeft trouwens ook voordelen we zijn niemand tot last en er zijn genoeg parkeerplekken voor de zondagse kerkgangers overigens is een mooi kerkgebouw niet het belangrijkste het gaat erom een liefdevolle gemeenschap te zijn maar we delen niet de mening van sommige evangelische gemeenten die een gebouw totaal onbelangrijk vinden een kerkgebouw is meer dan een plaats van samenkomst het is een thuis voor de gemeente voor dat gevoel doen wij ons best
4060900 we willen de wereld niet nadoen maar we willen aandacht voor ontmoeting en relaties
4060901 we aanvaarden de bijbel van kaft tot kaft ook als het gaat om zaken die in deze maatschappij moeilijk liggen zoals huwelijk en samenwonen samenwonen kent de bijbel niet zowel in het oude als in het nieuwe testament gaat het om echtelijke relaties

4060907 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
4060908 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion
4060909 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
4060910 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
4060911 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion

4060965 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4060966 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses

4060987 saya sudah pergi ke gereja selama 30 tahun dan selama itu saya telah mendengar 3000 khotbah tapi selama hidup saya tidak bisa mengingat satu khotbah pun jadi saya rasa saya telah memboroskan begitu banyak waktu demikian pun para hamba tuhan itu telah memboroskan waktu mereka dengan khotbah khotbah itu

4060989 there is no doubt that the situation in the air travel industry is serious and probably the most difficult it has ever been these capacity reductions should be seen in the light of an expected further slowdown in the economy in 2008 and 2009 although we remain financially stable with a satisfactory acid test ratio it is essential in the short term that we carry out the measures in the p08 program to be able to implement the long term s11 strategy
4060990 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt

4060992 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4060993 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4060994 she was always respectful to local customs and very attentive when listening to peoples views we are all in a complete state of shock she had a incredible commitment to humanitarian issues and was a wonderfully sensitive and dedicated person
4060995 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan

4061006 my putting on the front nine was bad there were some easy holes that i could have birdied and i did not
4061007 i started to putt better on my back nine and just hit the ball better overall i am confident going into the weekend and i am going to try and shoot under par the rest of the week

4061026 she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realized it was becoming a problem
4061027 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs
4061028 john is still mulling over their relationship he likes to have some space before deciding it is definitely over but he may be too late if these rumors that she is dating a model are true he will be really upset
4061029 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
4061030 contrary to reports jennifer didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
4061031 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4061032 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4061033 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

4061070 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4061071 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4061075 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

4061077 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4061078 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4061079 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4061080 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4061081 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4061082 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4061083 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4061084 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4061085 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4061086 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4061087 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4061088 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4061089 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4061090 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4061091 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4061092 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4061093 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4061094 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4061095 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4061096 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4061097 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4061098 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4061099 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4061100 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4061101 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4061102 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4061107 today a newspaper without a posse of blogs is so pass
4061108 might be the best washington political blog youve never heard of
4061109 deeper and better understanding of oregon politics than almost anyone
4061110 i realize im lucky in having the blog as my primary job while others still have to write for the paper as well
4061111 i have the luxury of being able to cover issues and people statewide and dont have to worry about writing for the paper
4061112 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4061113 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4061114 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4061115 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4061116 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4061117 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4061118 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4061119 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4061120 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4061121 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4061122 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4061123 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4061124 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4061125 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4061126 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4061127 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4061128 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4061129 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4061130 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4061131 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4061132 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4061133 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4061134 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4061135 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4061144 what hes saying is lets keep this out of a polarized political debate
4061145 what barack obama is doing is different from what people running for president traditionally have done
4061146 hes putting an option on the table not just saying he wants to work with congress but also saying what he wants to work on
4061147 weve studied a range of plans with combined employer and employee rates between 2 and 4 percent
4061148 is being fuzzed up to prevent people like me from running the numbers
4061149 it is factually inaccurate to say that a decision has been made to de link taxes from benefits
4061150 that is something youd want to work out with congress

4061193 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4061194 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4061204 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4061205 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4061210 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4061211 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

4061222 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4061223 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4061224 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4061225 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

4061229 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4061230 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4061231 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4061232 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4061233 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4061234 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4061235 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4061242 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4061243 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4061244 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4061246 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4061247 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4061248 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4061249 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4061250 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4061251 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4061252 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4061255 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4061256 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4061257 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4061258 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4061259 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4061260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4061261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4061314 champion the very best in new music and new dj talent
4061315 its been an incredible 13 years at radio 1 of all the shows ive presented dance anthems is the one im most proud of creating and i am delighted that even in our recent late night slot we increased audience
4061316 its time to move on but i have some exciting new radio projects to come
4061317 radio 1 is here to champion the very best in new music and new dj talent and i believe that these schedule changes mean we can continue to do this even more effectively
4061318 kissy kutski and mistajam are djs who are completely passionate about the music they play and the audience they play to im really happy that they will now all have their own regular shows
4061319 our newest recruits heidi van den amstel jaymo and andy george are a fantastic addition to the in new djs we trust lineup id also like to thank both dave and eddie for their commitment to radio 1 and wish them all the very best for the future
4061320 e tutti che facevano le corna muahauhauhauha u u dopo la funivia abbiamo girato un p il
4061321 i didnt know what the situation was going to be or what its going to be like at the end of camp im just going to go out and play as hard as i can and let the coaches do their job
4061322 i think matts definitely closing the gap theres no doubt about it
4061323 i think hes really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days
4061324 i dont know yeah i suppose he can competitions all over this place you never know how its going to work out
4061325 after the first pass i knew it could only get better
4061326 overall i felt like i did a pretty good job of just the mechanics of the offense most of the time i felt like i went to the right place with the ball obviously there were a few times when i made mistakes went to the wrong place maybe forced one in there on the first play but after that i felt pretty good about the way things were going
4061327 as a rookie first game its kind of hard to put a grade on it
4061328 im just going to go out there and play as hard as i can and let the coaches make decisions i really am here to do what helps the team the most if thats third string then thats going to be my job and im going to do that position proudly im going to play it and give it my best and let the coaches make decisions on everything else
4061329 but right this second were comfortable with the fellas we have albeit were young
4061330 there were certainly a few things that happened last year that you learn from
4061331 i really enjoyed winning the super 14 this year that was something i was proud to be a part of
4061332 i made sure what happened the previous year didnt affect the way i played the game and just to enjoy it
4061333 obviously we had some great success with the crusaders and i really started to feel i was playing some great rugby before i got injured against england
4061334 injuries are always going to happen i think ive been pretty lucky over the years in avoiding major injury setbacks and when it does happen you just got to get on with it
4061335 but im happy to be back and we still have a chance to win the tri nations
4061336 theres a good bunch of guys in this team and when the team performs you enjoy it a lot more
4061337 yeah the auckland win was a bit of a contrast compared to the week before
4061338 the sydney test was probably the worst performance by an all blacks side in quite a while
4061339 so to bounce back seven days later like we did was pretty satisfying
4061340 i think those two games in particular just show that there is very little between all three teams in the tri nations if you not giving 100 per cent you going to end up second
4061341 you just got to make sure you get your preparations right and make sure you play as well as you can
4061342 so while winning last week was a tremendous effort its easy to do it once however being able to back that performance up is the tricky part and thats what we will be going out to try and do on saturday
4061343 i think with this all blacks team we want to make sure that every time we go into a tri nations or enter a test match that we perform as well as we can and hopefully get the results we after
4061344 weve got two games left and if we can get up for both of them weve given ourselves a chance so thats what were aiming to do and im sure the other teams are doing exactly the same
4061345 he really hurts you there at the breakdown and in the physical side of things hes always amongst it
4061346 i know from experience that if you havent got any front foot ball he can be a real menace
4061347 but how the back row operates really depends on whats in front of you last week was a great indicator of that the front five got stuck in and made our job a lot easier
4061348 im sure saturday will be no different the team that wins the battle at the breakdown will no doubt have a stranglehold on the match
4061349 i dont look at this test match as a case of taking revenge
4061350 you just got to put the loss in dunedin to one side
4061351 sure we learnt a few lessons down there but i think this match in south africa whether we won or lost that game is still a motivation to come down and do your best
4061352 the tri nations is too close to call and if you not up to speed you lose thats more of the attitude weve got coming into this match
4061353 we havent had one in new zealand and i think theres only ten of them out there in the world
4061354 so its a hell of an achievement if you get there test rugby isnt easy and to get out on top after 100 games is remarkable
4061355 in the last few years hes certainly played a big part in the springbok team with his goal kicking and the experience he brings is priceless
4061356 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
4061357 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
4061358 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
4061359 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
4061360 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
4061361 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
4061362 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
4061363 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
4061364 we put chris martin in large pool full of octopuses the idea being to test whether they favoured their right or left feet
4061365 but only two of their eight legs were used for kicking four were used to slap him round the face and the last two to cover their ears
4061366 the good news is they play the bagpipes really well if we can get them to stop mounting them
4061367 if you really want your daughter dead of drugs and the terrorists to destroy our way of life then yes go ahead and buy some cheap shoes off an octopus in a market
4061368 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
4061369 this particular technique seems so standard im a little puzzled about why everybodys stuck on this example
4061370 i really dont know how a little girl in china might respond to being told your teeth are not good enough but doesnt that happen all the time in hollywood
4061371 the people were so emotionally involved if you asked them whats the most moving episode i think the majority would tell you that moment with the little girl in red clothes now the chinese people feel they are fooled the psychological hurt is enormous
4061372 the little girl is a magnificent singer she doesnt deserve to be hidden
4061373 the only thing i care about is that my daughter will not get hurt by this shell understand when she grows up
4061374 the dalai lama has taken the kind of courageous step that great political leaders make at crucial turning points in history
4061375 after more than 20 years of stalemate the dalai lama at great risk to his standing in the west and among tibetans in exile has unilaterally sent beijing a clear signal that he is now ready to accept the kind of difficult compromises that are needed to resolve the conflict
4061376 for the first time in decades reconciliation is now genuinely possible
4061377 our position and policy on the tibet related issue is clear and persistent we should not only take into account what the dalai lama said but what he has done we need to see concrete action
4061378 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
4061379 i guarantee that i would have got frankie gavin to make the weight i start working with ricky hatton and i get him to shift 45 pounds in time to make the weight before every fight
4061380 the important thing is that there was the will to address the problems and we knew how to do it
4061381 the server you are connected to is using a security certificate that

4061383 while we are far from satisfied with our performance year to date the second quarter results already show an improvement versus our first quarter

4061389 it was a perfect day i did everything for this day
4061390 to be the favorite and to be still the first afterwards thats a hard thing because you have a lot of pressure it was a really really tough race and now its a moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i am winning
4061391 i hoped for a race like this i knew the course suited me well i rode the race of a lifetime but he cancellara is strong
4061392 i was really fighting hard for that medal i gave it everything i had in the last bit and pushed myself very hard and it paid off and im very happy
4061393 i watched the tour and it was very difficult to watch because i so badly wanted to be there
4061394 to sit at home in july and watch the tour go on without me it definitely gave me motivation to train as hard as i could i came here knowing that i did my best with the situation i had and it gave me the peace of mind to push myself really hard

4061406 the dickson emeriti professorship will permit me to complete collaborative research abroad work with doctoral students on campus and play a leadership role in the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of special education at ucsb
4061407 it is significant to observe that professor michael gerber who was one of the first faculty members invited to join the new program in the school of education is now the chair of the department of education his leadership appointment when coupled with my dickson award reiterates the acceptance of special education as an academic discipline on this campus
4061408 professor semmel has had and continues to have a tremendous influence on the field of special education
4061409 the gevirtz school is honored that he will return for doctoral research seminars and delighted that our current students will have the great advantage of learning with him
4061410 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4061411 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4061412 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4061413 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4061414 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4061415 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4061416 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
4061417 my girlfriends a vegetarian and that pretty much makes me a vegetarian too
4061418 it seems to me its being framed in a very inaccurate way in this country
4061419 the government the presidential candidates and much of the media particularly conservative news media are calling this russian aggression against a sovereign state
4061420 clearly they have kept the two sides from destroying each other for the past 16 or 17 years
4061421 the second point is that the georgians started it launching this attack last week trying to take over south ossetia hoping that the russians would not respond in force and the russians reacted with their typical brutality driving the georgians out destroying the army and going on to bomb places outside of south ossetia
4061422 this small event a great distance away is important and it changes the whole equation in that part of the world
4061423 what the russians are saying is look this is not the 1990s we are not going to be pushed around again we will use our military might to defend against anyone who moves into an area we consider our own area
4061424 this is an important development and it should not be played down but we need to see it other than through the lenses of the cold war
4061425 we are not going to win a war in the caucasus an area of strong russian interests and not of strong interest to us
4061426 georgian president mikheil saakashvili would like us to believe that he is a front person for europe and at the borders between russia and the rest of europe but thats just not something i think we should regard as a primary interest
4061427 now i think it is very much in our interest that ukraine and the baltic republics remained independent

4061454 a bid came in last night and it was immediately rejected
4061455 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4061456 in the long hot autumn of 2000 the world was shocked by the contempt for democracy shown by the republican party
4061457 we conclude that the 2004 notice of termination is ineffective the 1994 agreement remains in effect
4061458 my clients are still weighing their options with regard to further appellate action
4061459 as john steinbecks publisher for over 60 years we are tremendously gratified
4061460 we were the young artists of a generation and we werent doing anything about it
4061461 and still arent but i dont regard an artists job to be socially active i see my job as commenting but it doesnt let me off the hook as a human being
4061462 music has to have a commercial side but without art it becomes a pollutant
4061463 this is a song about f cking i apologise for saying f cking if there are children here but luckily they all seem to be wearing earphones
4061464 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
4061465 sounds like a polite way of saying nothing a verbal silence
4061466 typically we see copycats shortly after a major campaign but this was sent by the same people
4061467 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
4061468 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
4061469 there tend to be associations between a brand and a country
4061470 the challenge for a chinese brand trying to go global is not really positioning itself but actually to position china well
4061471 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4061472 the jets game means a lot to me especially after the way last season finished
4061473 that was very disappointing and definitely stupid and id like to just erase all memory of that really
4061474 its been mixed emotions watching the matches ive got my good friends playing at the olympics and im so happy for them to be there representing australia
4061475 but at the same time i know that i should be there with them and i would be if i didnt do what i did in the grand final
4061476 its tough to take but ive only got myself to blame for it all im looking forward to getting past it now
4061477 i train with him every day and weve become very good mates in the few weeks hes been here
4061478 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but just in life in general hes a very smart man and hes passed on a lot of advice to me in the short time hes been with us
4061479 there was a time there where i thought everything was against me
4061480 the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question
4061481 sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non negotiable
4061482 this is an exceptional deal for our customers we have worked hard with hp and its channel partners to ensure it delivers cash savings it hits all the right buttons in terms of cash savings and green technology issues
4061483 i was involved in the event last year on the organisational side and attended as a helper
4061484 i was overwhelmed by the number of people putting themselves out to raise funds for our department i decided that this year it would be much more appropriate if i took part rather than sit on the sidelines
4061485 im looking forward to doing my bit and i also have an added bonus in that preparing for the event is getting me fitter and im losing weight which is making me feel much healthier
4061486 it started off as a discussion between three friends on a boat
4061487 we all realised the reason we are still here enjoying an active life was attributable to the raigmore cardiology department
4061488 we all agreed that we wanted to raise a significant amount of money to enable the team in cardiology to buy something that would enhance the lives of patients in the highlands
4061489 while the coaches in the background have helped its really been down to myself that has helped improve things on that front
4061490 its only me that can control things on the pitch i have learned to keep quiet get on with my business and i aim to do the same this year
4061491 everyone has got to have that bite and hunger its all about winning your one v one battles first and foremost
4061492 if you dont have that as a player i dont think you should be in the game it is competitive out there and everyone wants to win
4061493 its all about the balance and controlling discipline isnt a problem for me
4061494 its a massive confidence boost for me to reach 100 spl games
4061495 i feel i have developed since i moved to caley thistle it did take a bit of time to get my discipline sorted out but since then i have come on leaps and bounds last year was particularly good for me and i hope to maintain that level this season or progress even further
4061496 that must be up there with the game when we beat celtic at home here last season i thought all the boys were brilliant and it got that monkey off our backs by finally beating aberdeen
4061497 both teams like to attack and it could be a cracking game well look forward to it and prepare like we do for any other game
4061498 the council is aware it was very expensive we had been told it was the going rate but it is a pretty shocking amount
4061499 we are going to speak to sepa and the government about this to see if we can review the restrictions placed on local authorities it would have been a lot easier and cheaper to bury the body on the beach
4061500 we will be asking sepa to detail in writing the reasons for preventing burial and then we will organise a meeting with the government and sepa to see if we can review the situation
4061501 highland council asked sepa for advice on the disposal of the whale as per scottish executive guidelines
4061502 in choosing a suitable method for disposal several factors must be taken into consideration while sepa staff provided regulatory advice and discussed various options the final decision was taken by highland council
4061503 we are trying to promote tourism and there is all this rubbish on the loch side
4061504 people looking across the loch from my boat shed see all these white things on the other side and wonder what they are
4061505 its only when you cross the loch you discover its a dumping ground for fridges washing machines all sorts of stuff there was even a motorbike there one time its a damn disgrace
4061506 one of the boys was out in his boat when a tv was thrown over and exploded on the shore he got a hell of a fright and shouted at the guy but was told to f off
4061507 there are tvs hoovers all sorts of things being thrown over from the laybys
4061508 the council provide a service and there is also the recycling centre why dont people use them
4061509 its almost as if they are getting some sort of perverted thrill to go out and dump rubbish
4061510 as far as i am concerned it is totally unacceptable people dumping their rubbish willy nilly anywhere never mind loch ness which is an icon as far as tourism in scotland is concerned
4061511 its totally unacceptable for people coming into the area or living here all their lives to see the landscape littered by the products of modern society
4061512 the authorities should make the penalty for fly tipping so severe that this practice will come to an end
4061513 if that is how these people treat the countryside how are they treating their houses
4061514 loch ness is the jewel in the crown of scottish tourism yet a few people are prepared to treat it in this way they should be ashamed of themselves
4061515 local authorities along with sepa and the police have powers to issue notices for fly tipping offences of 50 the maximum fine available in summary proceedings for fly tipping is 40 000
4061516 there is no excuse for fly tipping which is illegal
4061517 highland council provides a bulky uplift service to collect large domestic items of furniture consumer goods or items which cannot fit into wheeled bins such as chairs tables sofas beds cupboards fridges freezers and cookers
4061518 we get 98 of our oxygen from the sea the sea is dying because of pollution and environmental degradation
4061519 i will die for the love of the mermaid her seduction beauty and scorn welcome to the end of your life hail the oceanborn
4061520 disgraced is my virginity death has woven my wedding dress oh great blue breathe the morning dew for you are the cradle for the image of god
4061521 i prayed for pleasure wished for love prayed for your
4061522 who the hell are you for me but a mortal dream to see
4061523 leave me be leave me be leave me be ee eeee e
4061524 consumption of personal alcohol is prohibited on the festival site
4061525 only alcohol purchased from one of the festivals bars can be drunk on site
4061526 also glass bottles and tin cans are not allowed on the beach for health and safety reasons so all our drinks will be served in recyclable eco friendly containers

4061536 it looks both worse and more broad based than the crunch in the early 1990s
4061537 you are seeing a second round now where credit tightening is showing up strongly in consumer and business loans
4061538 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
4061539 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
4061540 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
4061541 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4061542 they did have some good at bats made me work and put the bat on the ball
4061543 i was just trying to make pitches when i needed to
4061544 hes one of the best pitchers in the big leagues
4061545 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
4061546 its frustrating to play so poorly today we just didnt do anything good
4061547 in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4061548 i dont think that winning a gold would have much of difference on dds viewership
4061549 in terms of advertisers buying spots in dd i dont think that is going to happen because the majority of the indian television audience do not relate to the event
4061550 nevertheless some might approach the channel but there could be many other reasons for that for example dd gives a big reach to a product due to its largest network fundamentally its an individuals call at the same time one cannot guarantee that india will win more medals which might be a barrier for advertisers
4061551 it is difficult to speak on the clear impact this medal will have nevertheless if the trend of winning medals continues then advertisers might use dd as a medium to promote their brands
4061552 winning the gold at the olympics would definitely increase the level of interest media will also now cover the olympics in more details and it will also increase eyeballs however one will have to wait and watch if dd will manage to get more advertisers i dont think that just one gold medal will push the advertisers to the extend of buying spots on dd
4061553 we are in talks with a couple of channels but nothing has been firmed up
4061554 we are investing rs 1 5 billion for our channel our aim is to grab at least 30 per cent of the channel share of marathi gec
4061555 we are spending close to rs 150 million on the distribution of the channel and will on direct to home dth platform very soon
4061556 we have extensive reach in maharashtra and the hindi speaking belt we will use our 32 bureaux and 20 stringers across the nation apart from maharashtra we have a bureau each in delhi gujarat goa up mp and bihar
4061557 pandav is maharashtras answer to telematch the german game show it will have two teams comprising five members each and the contestants have to show the qualities of the pandavas to win
4061558 we are present in every city and town of maharashtra with our hoardings and print ads
4061559 while in pune we have put up 110 hoardings the number is close to 75 in mumbai in other cities at least 10 15 hoardings have been taken by us
4061560 it is a positive sign for advertisers as more competition will lead to competitive ad pricing also the new entrants should see the marathi regional genre grow
4061561 it will not be easy to sustain as a standalone channel but with the fresh programming we are hopeful of good response
4061562 some revenue will definitely get divided with its launch however in the long run a broadcaster with a bouquet of channel will survive whereas for standalone channels profitable operating will be a tough task
4061563 red fm is known for its attempt to always bring to light things that need attention under its initiative bajaao for a cause on the occasion of independence day red fm salutes the spirit of the war heroes who have sacrificed all to defend our borders
4061564 independence day is all about learning patriotic values and reliving those moments of struggle to achieve freedom with our special programming initiatives at radio mirchi we would like to celebrate the spirit of freedom and would also want to salute all those people who have made it possible
4061565 knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
4061566 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry wales said today at the global brand forum in singapore
4061567 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4061568 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4061569 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes said wales
4061570 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4061571 can participate in meaningful ways when they browse the internet he said
4061572 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways wales said
4061573 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians he said
4061574 canada has a very strong brand in the international community so ive discovered theres a lot of support for us
4061575 theres more to be done obviously were going to have to make a formal presentation in acapulco at some point in time likely in october but there is a warm receptivity shall i say for toronto and region in hosting the 2015 pan am games
4061576 were absolutely thrilled at the reception we got for the bid
4061577 this is a matter of establishing personal relationships of planting our flag and making it known to everybody we are serious and determined
4061578 and the fact we just recently received the support of the federal government was absolutely critical and vital to making sure this is well received
4061579 were talking about an investment here of close to 2 billion and that will serve to do something which i think is absolutely needed in ontario particularly in the southern part of ontario
4061580 we suffer from a shortage of amateur sports and recreational infrastructure and if we want to give our kids all the opportunities they need to experience amateur sports so we can have a flourishing sports culture then we need to make an investment
4061581 our independence day special celebrates the wild and is a reflection of our commitment towards conservation through this special line up we urge our viewers to think about the wild whose existence now depends on us
4061582 the public rarely gets an opportunity to see presidential candidates away from the glare of the cameras the crowds and the structured events these documentaries offer a real insight into the lives of the candidates and those around them
4061583 utvis explosive growth in such a short span of time is a result of its insightful intelligent and inspiring content which is backed by the best in class research support and an appeal that is designed to meet the business acumen of the progressive india
4061584 a bid came in last night and it was immediately rejected
4061585 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4061586 we are very disappointed therefore that they have continued their interest
4061587 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4061588 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4061589 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again
4061590 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4061591 so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4061592 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl
4061593 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4061594 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4061595 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4061596 shweta my daughter has come to be with us and to see the show but more importantly to be with her brother on raksha bandhan

4061602 singh is which released last week is still going strong and would be the first choice of family audiences during the festival weekend
4061603 bachna ae is only for the young audience vis vis god tussi which is a film for the masses because of salman khans presence
4061604 there has also been no pre release tempo preceding both the films even their music has not made a mark in comparison to the music of singh is kinng that is still driving people crazy
4061605 there is a good pre release response to all the three movies however it is true that singh is is still managing high sales
4061606 singh is going strong in its second week and is expected to keep on garnering sales but we have divided our screens equally for all the three movies
4061607 we are expecting a good business with bachna ae because of the yash raj banner in comparison to god tussi but singh is is still getting us business of around 70 percent even on weekdays
4061608 nothing affects the ticket sales it is tough but it depends on the film if an individual has to go for a film then he or she will definitely go for it come what may
4061609 i dont fear any movie there is nobody greater than god and i have my faith in him my movie is commercial but different the audience would come to know of it when they will watch it
4061610 there are a lot of expectations from both the movies both are big projects and have big stars it would be a great holiday period and the movies are expected to do great business
4061611 however what movie fares well at the box office depends upon the content that is the driving force of a film
4061612 with 50 movies to see before you die not only will viewers get to watch 50 of the greatest movies of all time they will also get to see iconic personalities from the film industry telling them what makes these movies great with this property we are further strengthening our differentiator that the worlds greatest movies are on utv world movies

4061663 instead of the government formulating a careful plan outlining their thoughts clearly and concisely with a clear time frame in mind this comment was simply made off the cuff
4061664 it seems that there had been little regard to how this speculative comment might impact on what is already a delicate market
4061665 these figures clearly show the effect that this loose statement has had on consumers and the property market as a whole none of which are encouraging

4061680 lord if my brother sins against me how often must i forgive him as many as seven times
4061681 i say to you not seven times but seventy seven times that is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants when he began the accounting a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount since he had no way of paying it back his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife his children and all his property in payment of the debt at that the servant fell down did him homage and said be patient with me and i will pay you back in full moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan when that servant had left he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount he seized him and started to choke him demanding pay back what you owe falling to his knees his fellow servant begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt now when his fellow servants saw what had happened they were deeply disturbed and went to their master and reported the whole affair his master summoned him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to should you not have had pity on your fellow servant as i had pity on you then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt so will my heavenly father do to you unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart
4061682 he seized him and started to choke him demanding pay back what you owe

4061696 commodity prices have entered a significant correction onthe back of slumping global growth and a stronger us dollar
4061697 this is good news for the global growth outlook and forshares generally as it takes pressure off inflation but itis bad news for resource shares

4061702 he said can you check her see if shes dead
4061703 thats how i relax and thats how i took my mind off of things
4061704 i picked her up and had her in my lap
4061705 someone who when he decided he wanted to do something he did it
4061706 he pushed his way in grabbed her shoulders and pinned her up against the wall
4061707 i felt like they were trying to get shock value
4061708 im hosting a pbs show and im involved in a childrens song writing program kid pan alley im not touring as much
4061709 we did one shoot up in the air in a hot air balloon
4061710 and weve interviewed charlie pastorfield after live from the hook and we should be interviewing sparkys flaw
4061711 i wouldnt say its influenced my song writing yet i havent had time for song writing but im around all this creativity and i know its going to be a flood when i do sit down and write
4061712 people want to dance so well play upbeat tunes ones weve written our favorite covers its a sound we really only play for fridays a new kind of energy for us
4061713 after these hats are off ill think about getting back on the road
4061714 nothing moves too fast in the folk world and you dont have to keep up with anyone except yourself which i cant do right now i think when my world slows down id like to experiment play around with style when i grow up i want to be a better guitar player

4061718 hickory smoked barbecue and some seriously down home atmosphere that ranks with some of the countrys best
4061719 this juicy sammich on texas toast will transport your mouth to the mississippi delta
4061720 i can look people in the eye and tell them that theyll never have better than this being able to be that honest about my food is something ive never had before in all my years in the restaurant business
4061721 the one time i got to curate an exhibit it took me about a year to put it together with the centerpiece being a sculpture made of car bumpers
4061722 living at home at age 35 without a job is not a good thing to do
4061723 i had made the mistake of going out to california with a woman id met at a wedding to see if we could work it out but we couldnt
4061724 so driving back from palo alto i made the decision that i was going to go to starnes barbecue in paducah kentucky where i always went as a boy when i visited my grandparents to see how they did it
4061725 i called ahead and they said that these were trade secrets and that they didnt want me within 100 feet of their pit
4061726 but when i finally got there 10 days later it was teenagers who were running the place and they were happy to show me
4061727 the problem with most barbecue is that they smoke it and they dry the hell out of it so they have to put all kinds of slaw and sauce on it
4061728 what i do is use indirect heat from a hickory fire to cook the meat so that the juices drop down onto the coals so it stays tender
4061729 it has to be this or it cant be anything
4061730 but if someone with deep pockets makes me an offer and will let me do what i do we have something to talk about
4061731 driving is more financially desirable because it boosts the economy much more than our typical commutes
4061732 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity

4061739 too high for the city to undertake in these economic times
4061740 and this will save money and preserve the character of the mall
4061741 the existing bricks on the mall could be easily recycled and re used
4061742 people implore city council not to squander millions on a needless brick replacement program they point out that most of the bricks are in good shape and that disposing of them would be a horrible waste then council votes unanimously to proceed as planned
4061743 id urge city officials and the public to go out and use their eyes
4061744 most of the bricks are fine and even where mortar is missing very few have shifted position this after four decades can we really expect a new mall to hold up better
4061745 but we are determined that the bricks will be re used or recycled or both
4061746 if it was my vote id say leave it alone
4061747 dry laid brick streets survive for hundreds of years without problems
4061748 after 30 years its a little worn and a little beat up so its time to freshen it
4061749 no i dont think so i think its misguided and inappropriate considering the needs of charlottesvilles community with such things as affordable housing
4061750 if it positively affects the environment then im for it 100 percent
4061751 we were surprised how many times we found that employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to long term foot and back problems feet bear the brunt of the daily working life and i nstead of worrying about what their staff look like employers should focus on the effect that the wrong shoes and prolonged standing can have employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and where possible provide the option of sitting

4061772 em portugal continuamos a brincar um bocadinho ao desporto continuamos a ter a sorte de ter uns cogumelos como algu m disse atletas que aparecem de vez em quando e que fazem resultados ptimos em alguns desportos
4061773 em portugal n o h por exemplo uma carreira nacional de treinador seria impens vel deixarmos de ser professores e deixar os nossos lugares nas escolas para nos dedicarmos exclusivamente aos trampolins s se fosse para rir
4061774 foi escrito foi dito pelos media que os trampolins s o uma das modalidades que n o se deve descartar em termos de atingir resultados de excel ncia quem escreveu quem disse quem inventou isso deveria ser responsabilizado
4061775 temos portugueses entre os 16 melhores do mundo em masculinos e femininos qualquer um deles pode ir a uma final
4061776 fizerem o seu melhor e n s fizermos o nosso melhor eles ganham
4061777 verdade que estamos entre os melhores do mundo mas dentro do sistema que est implementado em portugal estamos longe de ter as mesmas condi es que os outros ginastas t m nos outros pa ses
4061778 quando colocamos as fasquia l em cima a falar em n meros de medalhas a conquistar tudo bem um discurso ambicioso que fica bem mas pode depois dar nisto
4061779 o facto de muitos atletas terem vindo c lutar por medalhas e n o estar a correr bem para a equipa portuguesa
4061780 sinto alguma press o mas uma press o boa que me vai deixar um pouco nervosa naquele ponto de nervosismo que me faz bem me faz estar mais alerta para poder na competi o ter uma t cnica mais aperfei oada porque me sinto mais r gida e consigo saltar melhor
4061781 existem poucos lugares dispon veis para um n vel t o semelhante portanto muito dif cil atingir uma final
4061782 que os resultados apare am quer para mim quer para a minha modalidade quer para portugal

4061789 youre waiting around and in that time you couldve gotten something done like walk the dog
4061790 obviously for my job and doctors appointments i go out of my way to be on time
4061791 that way his being late equals him being on time
4061792 and heres the simple fact i got here on time and you can manage to as well
4061793 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
4061794 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
4061795 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something
4061796 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while
4061797 he always taught me its better to be safe than sorry
4061798 if im late for practice it just stresses me out
4061799 you make of it what you want to make of it
4061800 even if youre an adult and you read a book it takes you back to when you were younger
4061801 i still remember the first day my grandmother bought me a book it was great
4061802 you talk to a lot of people and they assume that there arent any new comic book collectors
4061803 comics have changed a lot its not just spider man and fantastic four and what you see in the movies right now
4061804 they even write moby dick and last of the mohicans and a lot of classic books
4061805 its a lot like any other kind of collecting in that people are complete ists
4061806 they dont just want issue number 12 and 35 it occupies your time for completing something
4061807 i dont think its the final goal of having them all
4061808 its the trip there once the guys have it all they lose interest and want to sell it
4061809 back in new york it was more adults about 90 percent
4061810 from a store owner perspective you get to talk to a ton of fans and get to talk about what you think can happen
4061811 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
4061812 he was just spoiling everything he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
4061813 the whole thing makes the anheuser busch company look totally childish
4061814 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
4061815 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking their sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
4061816 from our perspective it was more of a conversation than a confrontation
4061817 in the heat of the moment they saw people stickering our products in a non uniform way all over the boxes and the bar codes so they may have acted emotionally there and asked them to stop
4061818 their point is this is my property and youre defacing it my point is its just a positive cautionary message and its the store owners property
4061819 we are not opposed to the message the method theyre using is what were not totally in agreement with
4061820 i think there are probably better ways to communicate underage drinking is wrong that are more long term methods
4061821 we feel if it prevents one child from drinking and helps one parent to be aware of the situation then it is positive
4061822 so many books so little time a year of passionate reading
4061823 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
4061824 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
4061825 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
4061826 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
4061827 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
4061828 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
4061829 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
4061830 the hardest thing for me is doctors still arent really sure how to treat sarcoidosis symptoms
4061831 theres a lot of research on what to do for other diseases but not for this one so it can be hard to get the proper treatment
4061832 it was a tough sell before but it was doable simply because we didnt have a choice we dont want to deny ourselves access to the space station the very place we have built and paid for
4061833 thats a 100bn investment up there that we wont have access to

4061838 we have to deal with the aftermath of collisions where speed has played a contributory factor
4061839 it is quite simple the faster you drive the more likely you are to be seriously injured in a collision
4061840 this is why we work so hard to try and hammer home the message to slow down and take care on the countys roads speed limits are in place for a reason our officers will be out in force over the coming weeks and will actively be enforcing the limits
4061841 our message is clear slow down or expect to be caught

4061854 how long in time will you persist in ways that hurt you and think they need to exist
4061855 i did it in six hours which wasnt as quick as id hoped but the main thing was to make it to the end
4061856 going over the fells killed me to be honest then as i got closer to the end i really started to hit the wall my legs were really hurting by then
4061857 the best bit was definitely finishing but i did enjoy it and im really proud of myself

4061879 while on the one hand lehman has successfully transformedfrom a one business firm to a more diversified investment bank lehman remains the most fixed income sensitive firm
4061880 asset management remains a highly valuable asset leadingus to believe that a potential neuberger monetization would notbe motivated by capital shortfall but rather unlockingshareholder value and we think leaves the door open for apartial spin versus outright sale
4061881 i dont make predictions but i know we have a very good candidate who works hard and a city with a conservative council
4061882 we also have the county council elections next year and will be campaigning very hard throughout cumbria
4061883 i think thats changed if you look at the last local election results we won 41 seats in the north west
4061884 we control eight councils more than labour in the north west and we have more north west meps than labour
4061885 the conservatives can claim to be the party of the north west
4061886 im surprised he didnt visit the new university the sites of the new academy schools or look at the new flood defences
4061887 we just all got in bed she started saying stuff you better not tell anyone because ive got a boyfriend
4061888 then she started kissing and then we had sex with her that was it
4061889 we just started kissing each other in bed then she gave me oral sex she didnt say stop or anything like that
4061890 hi its nix here im really sorry about tonight i feel right bad about what happened please get back in touch because i want to crack with you because i want to apologise
4061891 its irrelevant anyway because that has nothing to do with what happened that night
4061892 det er ingen grunn til drasse med seg laptoppen til forelesninger eller m ter lenger
4061893 the suspect has admitted committing the crime she has equally mentioned the names of her syndicate members whom she said benefited from the illegal proceeds collected from the applicants
4061894 i am happy about the appeal court judgement the hand of gods in that judgement which has brought to an end to what could have been catastrophe
4061895 with election tribunal and politics over the governor will now settle down and execute his administrations four point agenda and transform enugu state
4061896 i speak to you as a proud citizen of enugu state i am overjoyed over what i see in enugu state because i saw the ugly travails of the past and the tremendous changes made by the governor in just one year
4061897 sono deluso per il risultato finale abbiamo avuto sprecato parecchie occasioni per vincere la partita
4061898 abbiamo giocato molto bene mentre il liverpool non ha offerto una prestazione allaltezza della sua fama ha proseguito il miglior giocatore belga del 2007 reina stato decisivo e mi auguro che tra due settimane ad anfield avremo maggiore fortuna il risultato finale lascia aperto il discorso qualificazione ma dopo una prestazione cos buona dispiace lasciare il campo senza aver segnato almeno un gol
4061899 il fatto che gerrard sia dovuto entrare in campo significa che abbiamo messo in difficolt i nostri avversari ha ribadito defour in caso contrario non avrebbero mai rischiato un giocatore reduce da infortunio
4061900 dovremo cercare di vincere le prime due gare di campionato in modo da arrivare caricati alla sfida di ritorno ha concluso il capitano lotteremo su ogni pallone anche tra due settimane sperando di non dover rimpiangere le occasioni fallite in casa
4061901 scotts agreed to go to falkirk and we need to move one or two more on just to freshen things up
4061902 i dont think its a surprise to anyone that we are having trouble finding housing for people
4061903 there are a lot of folks who are living very nicely in this community there are also a lot who are not living very well who are not so comfortable they have no surplus cash there is no disposable money in their household if they get sick they are in trouble if they get laid off theyll be without a home
4061904 we dont believe that this regulation goes into someones private home off campus
4061905 every so often there are students that are not willing to cooperate yet their health is deteriorating and we must take action
4061906 i think we all share that value but at the same time we felt that it was important to clarify that that was a choice that a student would ultimately be making not an obligation
4061907 this is the way it was before youre now reading it perhaps for the very first time and were sorry about that
4061908 i think that adversarial nature is one of the things that makes it something that student and faculty dont really want to participate in
4061909 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4061910 im like a kid at christmas and the present i want is ac milan in the first round proper
4061911 that would even eclipse the time raith played bayern munich in 1995 and the possibility of such a tie is only 180 minutes away
4061912 but we cant be dismissed out of hand because weve prepared thoroughly for the danes and now were itching to get at them
4061913 they need some creativity up front and some inventiveness in the team generally
4061914 and how not to relax when an opposing team is down
4061915 the first thing gary did when he came in was have a meeting with me he wanted to see if i was okay and was everything fine and it was
4061916 there were no problems between me and sammy lee other than our opinions
4061917 it was just the confidence that gary brought that helped me i think he gave confidence to the whole squad
4061918 you always say its a test of character when you go through tough times
4061919 when you look over the 38 games i think i had a half decent season i was delighted with how it ended
4061920 johan is more of a link up man than nic
4061921 he is good in the air and has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
4061922 we are not putting pressure on him to come in and take over from nic we are putting pressure on him to go out there and do what he does best
4061923 i think we will get a lot of benefit from johan this season and he will score quite a few goals for us
4061924 if we start how we ended last season we wont have any problems
4061925 we have the same team plus one or two good additions and we are looking forward to the season getting up and running
4061926 we played really bad and its clear we have to improve for the game at anfield
4061927 the positive thing is we got a result we kept a clean sheet and its still in our hands but we didnt play well
4061928 ive applied for jobs and have had graham taylor and terry venables speak on my behalf but i havent had any response
4061929 people cant say because it didnt work out at celtic it wouldnt in the second division where there is a much lower expectancy level
4061930 all evidence that was collected back in 85 back in 94 and evidence that has been recently collected by way of interviews and everything else will be examined with every modern technology we have available to us
4061931 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done
4061932 like someone had run round the house and picked up lots of different plastic bags
4061933 believed to conduct financial transactions for aqi and its car bombing networks

4061937 ok scoble wrap it up what are some things that you tech blogger types want from pr
4061938 so what jaiku and social thing do the same thing
4061939 theyve got the whole thing tarted up and its hard to tell what theyre actually doing
4061940 em portugal continuamos a brincar um bocadinho ao desporto continuamos a ter a sorte de ter uns cogumelos como algu m disse atletas que aparecem de vez em quando e que fazem resultados ptimos em alguns desportos
4061941 em portugal n o h por exemplo uma carreira nacional de treinador seria impens vel deixarmos de ser professores e deixar os nossos lugares nas escolas para nos dedicarmos exclusivamente aos trampolins s se fosse para rir
4061942 foi escrito foi dito pelos media que os trampolins s o uma das modalidades que n o se deve descartar em termos de atingir resultados de excel ncia quem escreveu quem disse quem inventou isso deveria ser responsabilizado
4061943 temos portugueses entre os 16 melhores do mundo em masculinos e femininos qualquer um deles pode ir a uma final
4061944 fizerem o seu melhor e n s fizermos o nosso melhor eles ganham
4061945 verdade que estamos entre os melhores do mundo mas dentro do sistema que est implementado em portugal estamos longe de ter as mesmas condi es que os outros ginastas t m nos outros pa ses
4061946 quando colocamos as fasquia l em cima a falar em n meros de medalhas a conquistar tudo bem um discurso ambicioso que fica bem mas pode depois dar nisto
4061947 o facto de muitos atletas terem vindo c lutar por medalhas e n o estar a correr bem para a equipa portuguesa
4061948 sinto alguma press o mas uma press o boa que me vai deixar um pouco nervosa naquele ponto de nervosismo que me faz bem me faz estar mais alerta para poder na competi o ter uma t cnica mais aperfei oada porque me sinto mais r gida e consigo saltar melhor
4061949 existem poucos lugares dispon veis para um n vel t o semelhante portanto muito dif cil atingir uma final
4061950 que os resultados apare am quer para mim quer para a minha modalidade quer para portugal
4061951 weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4061952 money isnt the issue plenty of that in the bank
4061953 the mon calamari will have time to suffer and reflect on their crimes until all are extinct i will purge the galaxy of their culture and history such will be the fate of all who oppose the sith
4061954 we are imperial knights we do our duty by the emperor and the force no matter the cost that is the difference between you and me
4061955 i do it because i like free stuff and wont get caught id do the same with anything if i knew id get away with it
4061956 the area has been in and out of drought since the start of the decade mostly in
4061957 but fall of last year was when it really started to get bad in some places this year has been as dry or even drier than the dust bowl
4061958 the people around here learned their lessons in the dust bowl and the drought of the 50s
4061959 they know it can get bad and they take care of the land year in and year out so when a drought does hit it helps protect their resources a little more
4061960 nearly everyone in the farming community around here has a conservation plan and tries very hard to follow those plans
4061961 the irrigated crops arent making it because although the farmers have watered and watered the high winds and heat are so excessive the water cant keep up with the evaporation rate
4061962 then if the plants do come up wind erosion cuts them off and kills the crop
4061963 buffalo grass is the most resilient of the native grasses to drought and grazing
4061964 the likelihood of drought in regions where the average summer rainfall falls by perhaps twenty per cent
4061965 propaganda bezeichnet einen absichtlichen und systematischen versuch sichtweisen zu formen erkenntnisse zu manipulieren und verhalten zu steuern zum zwecke der erzeugung einer vom propagandisten erw nschten reaktion

4061967 people have been calling me the seniormost actor in the film i almost feel like amitabh bachchan now the others in the film are extremely good actors and not at all inexperienced
4061968 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
4061969 i was completely pampered on the sets and have finally made two great friends in ranbir and siddharth i have not spent enough time with the girls though
4061970 i got a lot of compliments in italy for the clothes i was wearing italian men only know how to romance they are impeccably dressed with styled hair and they only want to marry you
4061971 a nossa suspeita que o senhor laranja possa ter sido beneficiado numa estatal a partir das rela es dele com a governadora

4061973 walang gustong mangyari ito kaya kahit paano ay binibigay namin lahat ng suporta sa pamilya para naman sila makaadjust
4061974 commendable pa nga si 1st marine brigade commanding officer col rustico guererro na humiram ng chopper sa us para maevacuate agad yung mga wounded marines
4061975 ginawa naman namin lahat ng magagawa namin it takes time kasi nasa gitna ka ng encounter may sugatan ka hahanap ka ng landing zone isesecure mo yon tapos nag bad weather pa
4061976 remember there are only ten marines there at that encounter apat ang sugatan bad weather pa hindi naman ganon kadali ang mag labas ng sugatan sa gitna ng bakbakan
4061977 it is not true that there was no air force chopper that arrived the chopper was available but the weather condition did not allow the chopper to evacuate the wounded
4061978 it was not a sikorsky chopper it was a bell 412 the civilian chopper responded to the situation it came at a time when the weather allowed it to enter the location
4061979 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4061980 it would have been an honor to fight de la hoya on his last fight capping a very illustrious boxing career but under the circumstances the option left is to move on i have already made specific instructions to my lawyer to start negotiating with bob arum for my next fight with any possible opponent at 135 lbs
4061981 gbp ceo richard schaefer and i had a good meeting and we resolved the other issues
4061982 oscar wanted 70 30 and richard and i figured that there would be room for movement oscar was supposed to come in to los angeles this week to meet with richard in person but he didnt make it and had to do it on the telephone oscar was adamant about it being 70 30 or no deal richard told me that and that i transmitted it to pacquiao and his people in the philippines they told me that there was no deal and to look to make another fight
4061983 pacquiao has an adviser and lawyer gacal who basically is caught up in percentages but if you go buy a car or a house or food do you pay in percentages or in money the answer is you pay in currency not in percentages i hope this has properly been explained to manny
4061984 el torito concepcion will defend his newly won title against mexican warrior jorge arce in mexico city on september 15
4061985 were very excited to have sheila on our advisory board her rich experience at microsoft which encompasses marketing technical evangelism and business strategy development across global markets will be an asset to aurigo as we expand our presence in the us emea and apac regions
4061986 we are fielding a relatively young side with a lot of our new players included bath are a strong side and we are hoping to learn a lot from this game we have worked really hard during the pre season months and put new systems in place so i am looking forward to watching the team play we all really enjoyed the supporters event on tuesday night and i know the players are really keen to start this season well and give all those supporters something to cheer about

4061988 for any citizen with time to spare and a canny eye to work out what is actually going on but for the many there is not time and the network news is the only news even though it may not be news at all but only a series of flashing fictions

4061992 the ceasefire may be weak but at least it has the advantage of existing
4061993 the europe of 27 members states is not well placed to curb russian confidence
4061994 too many countries freed from the yoke of moscow are driven by a desire for revenge against russia to allow for a calm united and consensual european diplomacy poland and the baltic states are not ready
4061995 want to avoid any impression of an anti russian coalition
4061996 shuttle diplomacy between moscow and tbilisi a high risk exercise
4061997 can speak with a strong voice for balance and for peace
4061998 announced the end of hostilities before mr sarkozy had even landed in moscow
4061999 judging from the grave expression on his face it seems that the french president was aware that he had swallowed everything the russians told him
4062000 mr sarkozy isnt claiming to have solved the explosive problem of the caucasus the status of southern ossetia and abkhazia will be resolved later
4062001 these companies are making a lot of money by doing highly targeted and selective advertising of these products our petition seeks to block these advertisements
4062002 mere belief cannot be the point because belief does not change us at the depth of our true need only what is revealed in our direct experience in body heart and mind altogether rather than mind only can transform us

4062024 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
4062025 vi taler om resultater som g r at vi m se med helt nye briller p sp rgsm let om sammenh ngen mellem v gt og helbredsrisiko
4062026 the rabbit is an exit program for whether you are long or short no matter what you are trading or what your investment philosophy it maintains your original strategy to exit a trade
4062027 not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
4062028 the band were very much looking forward to going there
4062029 but the organisers could not fulfil their obligations and as a result they have cancelled our show this is in no way due to any fault of the band
4062030 i dont do a lot for myself id rather be helping others
4062031 you go over to some of the places in africa that we work with and you have people there that are pretty much living in a home made of cardboard or living on a dollar or two a day
4062032 by world standards americans are wealthy and so you go over there and one of the things they have to get used to is that they are almost like superheroes or a walking wallet
4062033 i still kind a think i might be going to college in the fall a lot of my friends are though
4062034 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4062035 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4062036 many market players took a break from active trading as they were unsure whether the currency would add to its big gains recently or whether there would be a correction
4062037 the market was in a lull today as there werent many factors to encourage buying of the dollar or the yen
4062038 but i would say the u s currency remained firm with support from the recent adjustments in commodity markets
4062039 given the recent fall in crude oil prices worries about inflation are fading so the ecb may well decide to implement an economic stimulus measure which means a rate cut
4062040 were going to share some ideas about how to move the process forward
4062041 people need to realize the severity of these allergies that the children can literally drop dead if a teeny bit of allergy gets even in their eye up their nose in their mouth on their food
4062042 its not just a matter of saying that child should not eat the nuts
4062043 as a community our job is to teach our kids to live in the world
4062044 is not teaching children how to grow up in the real world
4062045 what we want is everyone always thinking there could be a possibility of an allergic reaction and be on guard for it
4062046 as children get older and more responsible you dont have to have anything like a ban
4062047 you want them to learn to deal with the situation
4062048 as the kids get older im not really in favor of the ban
4062049 we dont ban peanut butter because we feel it is a staple among young children
4062050 you just cant monitor whats in every persons lunch pail
4062051 when people understand theres a life at risk everyone starts to feel a little sympathy
4062052 we know we cant put her in a bubble and send her to school
4062053 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4062054 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4062055 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4062056 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4062057 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4062058 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4062059 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4062060 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4062061 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4062062 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4062063 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4062064 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4062065 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
4062066 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4062067 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4062068 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
4062069 i did tell eric on the phone the day before i came up i said hey i want to play as soon as possible
4062070 i wouldve played three plays the other night at cleveland but that wouldve been ugly i dont know i think well just play it by ear
4062071 you cant afford to do that during the season so i hope that were getting that out of our system now those were my fault i overthrew one underthrew another one i think thats where a week from now well be much better
4062072 the ctchc is again taking us the community as scrap
4062073 no hice mi rutina de ejercicios durante tres semanas pero me siento bien
4062074 trot un poco y salt unos obst culos y me sent bien
4062075 we are but of yesterday yet we have filled all that is yours cities and islands forts and towns assemblies and even military camps tribes councils the palace the senate the forum we left you only the temples
4062076 the more we are hewn down by you the more numerous do we become
4062077 do you not see that the more of them are executed the more do the others grow in number
4062078 the church of christ has been founded by shedding its own blood not that of others
4062079 just as with the vine when someone cuts away the fruit bearing parts it grows up again and puts forth other branches both flourishing and fruitful it happens the same way with us
4062080 now that theyve fallen out of the nest the mother wont come back for them
4062081 i couldnt live in brooklyn anymore id never get anything done look at that one over there
4062082 umbrellas remind me of big capped mushroom that are soft and pink on the underside except these mushrooms sprout with the touch of your fingertips on a little button and just like that this little everyday thing made from nylon and veins like spider legs that you were carrying around in your purse or had shoved in your back pocket is protecting you like dorothy with her ruby slippers in the wizard of oz and you huddle beneath it or share it with the person next to you and you feel small beneath it like youve fallen down a rabbit hole like alice in wonderland and youre in your own little world
4062083 when i was young i asked my father why the sky is blue
4062084 and he began explaining to me about how the earth is made up of mostly water and all the water reflects and makes the sky look blue we had a bunch of marbles at the house and you know which one was coveted
4062085 so this doesnt have anything to do with the marble but whenever it would rain i thought that the raindrops should be blue too one day it started to rain and i was too young to remember but my dad told me that we were in the car and i got all upset because when it started hitting the windshield it was raining really heavy i started saying that the big blue marbles are hitting the windshield and its going to break
4062086 my dad tried to calm me down and he told me that when the raindrops fall out of the sky they have to travel so far that by the time they reach people theyre really soft to the touch so i always think of what he said when it rains and i always think that rain drops are blue colored marbles falling from the sky wouldnt that be something if the raindrops painted everything including people shades of blue
4062087 i was thinking that the blue would mix with the existing color and we would all be different shades the color washes off of course it isnt permanent anyway thats my little story about the big blue marble and raindrops and blue people
4062088 yes the blue world would be nice but most people in literature and music use rain and water as a metaphor for cleansing and clearing away any artifice dirt negativity sin
4062089 we could all be blue people and the sunlight could be the metaphor that bleaches us back to our individual colors wed all be the same just for a moment on the outside anyway
4062090 then rain would be more feared than earthquakes or hurricanes but it would be nice to be the same for a moment
4062091 all intimacy should be shared in a whisper at least the first time
4062092 small sweet things like strawberries on pancakes at breakfast time
4062093 after the first time they can be shouted or spray painted on the side of a delivery truck
4062094 but i think that everyone will know after the words are spoken the first time love is something that you can just sense about two people when they are together everyone will hear it then

4062111 well since were putting people in boxes what type of girl do you think im interested in
4062112 a girl like me a former church girl whod never waxed her eyebrows before moving to the city and now i fit in quite nicely type im the loyal smart type who believes in love because her parents are still happily married type educated from a middle class background type who knows to send a thank you card when someone does something nice for me type the compassionate public servant type whos learning to make a living from her art type
4062113 the way you explain it sounds more interesting than my girls type
4062114 you went to the right school joined the most popular fraternity always got what you wanted growing up maybe just a bit of a mamas boy type but that wasnt bad because she raised you right and now youre insanely successful in a very cut throat business which means that a lot of people love you and just as many loathe you but youre true to your friends you have a heart beneath the designer shirts and a soul behind the designer shades but sometimes you get caught up in the hype you like the best of things especially when it shows on the outside but what you cherish the most is discovering something before anyone else and having a secret all to yourself if only for a little while
4062115 yes in some form or another theres nothing wrong with any of these traits individually but all at once can be a bit
4062116 i really like these little curls have you always worn your hair like this
4062117 i was just about to kiss you did you know that

4062127 the group has traded particularly well in the last quarter of its financial year and this combined with good trading conditions experienced throughout the financial year means that air partner now expects to report year end results ahead of current market expectations
4062128 however while the financial year has started in line with expectations booking lead times are shorter and forward orders are currently slightly softer
4062129 the final phase of our business plan has always been to significantly increase sales and this fund raising gives us the required working capital to achieve this

4062136 we urge him to do his rightful duty to the people who are now at the crux of the crises we can do more confrontational house visits if he compel us to
4062137 what is he afraid of it is the workers who should be wary of his probable maneuvers to delay or totally evade the wage hike

4062144 courage is almost a contradiction in terms it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers it might be printed in an alpine guide or drill book this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage
4062145 o rthodox theology has specially insisted that christ is not a being apart from god and man like an elf nor yet a being half human and half not like a centaur but both things at once and both things thoroughly very man and very god

4062152 we should probably go ahead and strip all assumptions out of how
4062153 the two presidents have instructed their foreign ministers to take the necessary steps in this regard starting from today
4062154 in the face of all those who are manipulating its security and stability
4062155 were canceling these tickets because they are in breach of our terms and conditions the third party is breaching our copyright

4062159 parlammo per due ore e lui mi raccont tutta la sua storia da quando si era trasferito dallolanda a londra proprio a causa dei joy division
4062160 era stato allora che aveva scattato quella foto diventata ormai leggendaria di ian che scendeva i gradini della stazione della metropolitana qualche mese dopo ian si era ucciso e la fotografia era diventata immediatamente un qualcosa di fondamentale
4062161 dentro di me desideravo ardentemente che fosse lui a dirigere il film visti i suoi collegamenti e il suo rapporto cos personale con la band
4062162 prima che mi raccontasse del suo trasferimento a londra non sapevo che il suo legame con la band fosse cos profondo e personale e questo mi riport subito a mente una frase che aveva pronunciato potrei essere lunica persona adatta a dirigere questo film non laveva pronunciata in maniera arrogante ma in un modo che mi aveva fatto capire che voleva comunque proteggere la storia e io gli avevo detto la sai una cosa tu sei lunico che potrebbe dirigere questo film non ho mai pensato che il fatto che fosse alla sua prima esperienza dietro la macchina da presa rappresentasse un problema
4062163 it is understood that president mugabe and mutambara subsequently agreed on these issues paving the way for mugabe to form a new government and for the seventh parliament to start sitting following elections held earlier in the year
4062164 tsvangirai would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4062165 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
4062166 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of
4062167 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4062168 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4062169 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4062170 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4062171 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4062172 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4062173 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4062174 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4062175 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
4062176 we are pumping gas again into the south caucasus pipeline
4062177 the baku supsa pipeline remains suspended for the time being it goes through the middle of the country
4062178 its a different route from scp so were still assessing the security implications and that remains suspended
4062179 while the conflict in georgia may have been the of attention for us the most significant supply event was the attack on the btc line in turkey and the implication that it may continue to be a target and one the length of which makes it virtually impossible to defend comfortably
4062180 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key

4062199 the dictionary is for the irrational nincompoop okay i will give it a try does it come from romans
4062200 see the romans were crude gladiators heartless killers of early christians you have heard of nero and caligula the mad roman emperors how can romantic come from the romans
4062201 look neelam todays romans are romantic you agree so there ought to be a link
4062202 no link wink the romans can only wink by the way do you know the meaning of the french word roman
4062203 oh god you have given me the clue romantic must be coming from the french people
4062204 neelam fell into a daze and an angelic trance and she continued to be like that till the exams despite my warnings and prodding and she failed and as for me out came i with flying colours
4062205 oi neelam immediate aa come here your daughter has picked up a word from the tv explain to her what romantic means
4062206 theres always a little bit of rivalry between the four of us i think thats what spurs us on
4062207 sometimes we worked together helping each other when our subjects overlapped but mostly we worked apart
4062208 it was quite chaotic in the house in the run up to the exams but everybody knuckled down
4062209 youd go into a room and find there was already someone in there revising and it would be like oh no
4062210 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning
4062211 weve realised that aiming for the highest is really going to help us
4062212 at first we were probably pushed on but now we see it as the best way to help ourselves
4062213 we all know weve tried our best especially going through the exam process together weve all been helping each other
4062214 its more like holding each others hand and being there
4062215 i was really really excited all last night my friends and i were looking on the internet for any clue on our results we couldnt sleep then at 10am i got my results and it was incredible
4062216 at first it wasnt very easy for me to get on with my fellow students and i couldnt understand everything the teachers said
4062217 but my english teacher helped me and encouraged me to read books and told me i would have to work harder
4062218 documented history and commonsense bear witness to the facts that support my claim the holy church hc has embellished the myth of jc with great falsehoods for purposes of misleading and confusing mankind so that they may degrade the sacred human spirit to nothing more than that of lost sheep
4062219 then they appoint themselves in my name as shepherds to these lost sheep i dont even need to prove this these facts prove themselves their own propaganda and teachings from the pulpits confess to these intentions
4062220 i just want them to stop using my name i would like them to remove all references to my mythical life and symbols of my fabricated death from the bible all churches and all buildings used by the hc
4062221 yet you feel confident in denying that i could be jesus christ
4062222 yes i feel confident in denying that because it would be impossible for you to be jc any normal person who claims to be jc is clearly suffering from a delusion
4062223 but sir i am saying that i am jc the very fact of my stating that is the basis of your labeling me delusional if i were to stop saying that then i would not be delusional is that right
4062224 youve never met jesus christ how can you either confirm or deny that i am he
4062225 the bible sir are you aware that the bible is a publication sponsored by the hc
4062226 honorable judge i object to the witness using a propaganda tool of my opponent to disprove my identity
4062227 objection sustained dr thomas you cannot use the teachings of the bible to prove that he is not jc
4062228 dr thomas if you were to ignore everything you have learned based on the bible and that includes the name jesus christ as referred to in the bible then would you be able to either confirm or deny it that i am jesus christ
4062229 is there any way that jc could be around 2000 years old
4062230 in my opinion his molecular age is between 25 and 45 years old
4062231 dr peters have you ever studied any being not necessarily even from the human species that has lived for 2000 years and is currently alive
4062232 no i have not i am not aware of such a specimen
4062233 so you have no specimen no research and no data relating to anything or anyone that has lived for 2000 years and is currently alive
4062234 do you think you have researched all there is to research about all living beings
4062235 no sir i do not there is much i do not know this is why i have been careful in stating that this is my opinion based upon my own limited knowledge about your molecular age and not your chronological age
4062236 have you developed any test at all that could determine either the chronological or molecular age of a living creature who could be 2000 years old
4062237 it would be impossible to develop a test when there is no specimen to test on or in fact to even base the test on for expected results
4062238 so youve never seen a living creature of any species at the age of around 2000 that is currently alive if you had seen such a specimen you wouldnt know because there is no test to prove it

4062248 the board of control for cricket in india cricket australia and cricket south africa today announced the rescheduling of the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20 from september october to early december the three founding member boards reiterated that this was a goodwill response to a request from the international cricket council icc to consider new playing dates for 2008
4062249 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4062250 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4062251 this is not about me trying to force a political candidate on you and trying to see how you vote
4062252 i wanted to thank all of you who contributed to mitt romney you cant realize how much leverage this gives huron going forward to ask various people for business

4062258 i treat him just like everybody else on this team webster said
4062259 my expectations of him are just like everybody else i dont treat him any different i dont sit on him any more i dont give him any extra privileges
4062260 hes around good people good players good coaches a good administration and hes just got to be like everybody else thats all
4062261 kev is very good with that sort of stuff kevin is a very forthright person he has very strong opinions he believes in
4062262 its going to be a big series it was a big series out here last time and it will be a huge series when we go there
4062263 thats the rivalry that cricket needs to thrive in the longer version not just twenty20
4062264 we havent lost many test matches since 2005 so if form is anything to go by weve probably got them
4062265 kevin is good at making statements he truly believes it good luck to him
4062266 if hes thinking about cricket in one year i would have thought hed want to worry about whats happening in the next few months
4062267 but hes the new captain and full of bravado if he loses a few tests we will see if hes still saying something then
4062268 i first wrote asking to use his name in a song for the bicentennial
4062269 in fact bradman was also very musical he played the piano you know although he downplayed his skill
4062270 unfortunately bradman did not recall our meeting that night and i did not recall the next time when i met him in 1961

4062272 there wasnt any such club locally and the hunts are much safer and easier to do in a club than on your own he said
4062273 after several years of running the businesses as two completely separate and distinct operations we recognized a tremendous opportunity to serve customers much more effectively by combining the strengths of wms and seamobile wireless
4062274 under this agreement we greatly expand our wireless coverage footprint and bring the benefits of over 300 worldwide roaming agreements to the legacy seamobile wireless fleet this will allow a vast majority of mobile phone customers worldwide to use their wireless phones seamlessly when aboard cruise and ferry ships that provide wms wireless voice and data communication services
4062275 we believed that the best way for seamobile enterprises to realize the potential of our maritime wireless business was to fully integrate our operations into the wms joint venture
4062276 our broader vision of providing at sea and remote location communications connectivity and content services throughout the world continues to advance with our maritime wireless services now being offered exclusively through our joint venture with at amp t mobility
4062277 we have been pleased with our relationship with seamobile wireless during the past two years
4062278 this announcement marks another important milestone in our relationship through wms we fully expect to continue delivering a superior maritime wireless service to our guests and crew while adding the attractive benefit of now offering service aboard our ships to millions of at amp t mobility customers and others who have service with the joint venture roaming partners
4062279 if love is all you have well then baby thats not bad and if love is all you got thats a hell of a lot
4062280 we are adding all of this new space for one reason to make room for reaching out to men women and children who could use some of gods love and hope in their lives
4062281 i think that somewhere out there theres a solution thats just waiting to be found
4062282 its a compromise of some sort between the developers and the citizens what we perceive to be useful development as opposed to big box stores i would urge the council to take a little bit of time lets find that solution thats out there
4062283 you are in a very small group of vocal citizens against development
4062284 it is also very obvious that the group opposing this ordinance does not represent the future of murrysville by gauging the age of the attendees
4062285 wait and see i bet you will be doing more shopping in murrysville soon and enjoying it thank you for your input
4062286 a majority of the people youve heard speak against the overlay ordinance are not against development that may be something you feel we are against in total but that is not quite true
4062287 i think that theres been a misconception as to the amount of development i think that at least what weve seen proposed is an upscale shopping district with one anchor i dont feel that big boxes are going to be taking over murrysville
4062288 theres only two of our council members who pay any attention to the public
4062289 it was said to be a done deal a year ago and apparently it was they just basically ignored us for eight months
4062290 but its not a bad thing to try to investigate if there are ways to do things better
4062291 an obligation to point out corrections in a timely manner
4062292 its going to be a big culture shock coming from a country where medical care is taken for granted she said
4062293 i think the biggest struggle will be seeing how impoverished people are
4062294 shes wanted to go into medicine since she was 5 years old
4062295 i have never been joe citizen and dont plan to be for some time
4062296 i havent been that in 29 1 2 years never when i walk into a restaurant i know exactly who is sitting where what they are wearing who theyre facing how the cars are parked in the parking lot
4062297 its the approach we used in the last several years when vacancies opened up in our fire recreation and public works departments
4062298 so we think in the long run it pays to do an exhaustive search and go through this kind of process
4062299 i may be missed as a friend or a coworker but i am absolutely confident they wont miss a beat and thats the biggest tribute i could ask for
4062300 i took an fbi course in psychology at quantico va and the instructor said that when youre the chief every day you should soar in like an eagle whether youre getting a divorce or your kids wrecked the car or you have cancer or whatever your problems you should walk in and make people glad to be there
4062301 one of the things i am proudest of as chief is that in 10 years of dealing with the school district they have a lot of issues and stresses of which im sure im not aware but we have been able to find areas of mutual concern
4062302 cissy bowman the head of media relations and communications has been a great partner with us we now put out joint press releases in some cases if the school district and the municipality put out the same message first of all it has a calming effect and second it demonstrates that local government is working on all levels
4062303 we share this issue with the school district people dont want to hear about it later they want to be informed now
4062304 the night i got the call that one of my officers had been shot it was like one of my own kids had been shot i can never replicate that feeling the drive from my house to the constants front yard
4062305 rather than call people to my office i just tend to wander around i know thats something that was made famous in corporate america no one likes to be summoned to the chiefs office it makes them nervous
4062306 if i could find a way to stay here until i drop dead of old age id do it

4062310 their expertise in managing successful events and conferences will be invaluable to the clientele of the cvb
4062311 it was strongly suggested by the council representative that given financial irregularities that apparently are over there it might be a good thing for a new board to be seated
4062312 the conventions and events currently scheduled for monroeville will be fully supported by the cvb and the interim management team
4062313 a lot of residents have actually complimented him on his diligence in pumping water out of basements people seem to be satisfied
4062314 he couldnt give me a reason other than that he wanted to go in a different direction this year
4062315 why all of a sudden after 16 years are we replacing somebody
4062316 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is retribution
4062317 a significant number of your residents are not satisfied with how this has been handled
4062318 if mr campagna thinks there could be a conflict then 2 500 is a small price to pay to make sure everything is checked and balanced
4062319 as far as im concerned were not practicing fair bidding practices its not the american way
4062320 take it to court and we lose every single penny
4062321 the idea is to hit them real fast but only use five shots
4062322 the actual key to winning these games is not only shooting quickly and accurately but also changing gears in midstream and going from fast to slow thats the key
4062323 the top 25 people thats literally all they do is compete every year i have gotten better up here as i become a little bit more accustomed to it there is a lot of money and pressure
4062324 its a primer for new shooters they are just trying to promote firearms and it has really expanded
4062325 the people that come out are great its a real eye opener for them just to get them shooting and to understand the safety rules how to operate firearms and how to actually hit the target i see more huge smiles on peoples faces than with anything else i have ever done we are really helping to grow the industry so its very rewarding
4062326 the opening ceremony i enjoyed but after that i didnt say another word or talk to anyone until the competitions began
4062327 sometimes you only have one shot and if you dont get it right your whole dream withers away
4062328 i definitely wasnt the best wrestler in my weight class or the fastest or smartest
4062329 i actually got more confident as a match went on
4062330 find a sport that is right for you stick with it be patient you will go through a lot of success and failure but stick with it
4062331 what makes this store unique is the donations we receive
4062332 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
4062333 this is going to be the model of all of our stores
4062334 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
4062335 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much
4062336 our goal is keeping the stores well rotated and well stocked
4062337 if you want to be the star football player this is not the school for you
4062338 this is for students and families who want something different
4062339 i have to be at work at 8 a m if i have to take my children to different day care centers ill be late for work every day
4062340 we dont have any idea what will be happening in a few weeks
4062341 while we have transported students around the district in the past without regard to home school this has changed this school year as we attempt to more effectively and efficiently utilize our transportation resources the board continues to look at the day care issue to determine the best way to balance parents needs and the districts resources
4062342 i said this might be the one time in my life i get to wear a tux
4062343 i took my granddaughter lauren patton up to see that and these 20 something fellows are standing there
4062344 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
4062345 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
4062346 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
4062347 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
4062348 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
4062349 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
4062350 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it
4062351 we were nervous about her we didnt want her to start swimming
4062352 the new company is a huge opportunity to connect with the community
4062353 its a win for the students for the school and for everyone who comes to the performances
4062354 mr carosella had written to dr ender offering to help with a new theater company
4062355 when i met him i knew it was a great match we had the same vision for what we could do for the college
4062356 but its also fun and exciting and doors are starting to open
4062357 we are focused more on using data to drive instruction and for decision making
4062358 how do we educate a child who comes in with a myriad of problems from period one
4062359 its high time for us to look at a child as a human being and say its our job to take this person from point a to point b lets look at the whole child
4062360 the rigor associated with pre k counts standards will help them while they transition into kindergarten that helps when they go into pssas
4062361 we wanted to up the ante for wilkinsburg kids and set standards so that kids can get a head start
4062362 theyve been totally committed to the idea of pre k counts in the district and that made our jobs easier
4062363 weve had very good cooperation with teaching staff school board and administration without that collaboration none of this would be possible
4062364 we are extremely pleased to be working in partnership with pttep in the pursuit of flng opportunities pttep has a clear strategy to expand its e amp p business and it brings to the partnership strong capabilities that are complementary to golars floating mid stream capability

4062372 siamo innocenti ma se ci trovassero colpevoli per colpa vostra signori giornalisti siete voi che avete dato i punteggi pi alti ai profondi vellutati vini non sangiovesizzanti che abbiamo fatto
4062373 tutti i suoli delle vigne contengono circa 20 30 tracce di metalli quali selenio o molibdeno
4062374 i modelli cambiano a seconda della regione in cui ti trovi prima si stabilisce il modello delle tracce di metalli per vini fatti sono con uve cresciute in montalcino poi si analizzano vini da regioni al di fuori la zona di montalcino che si pensa possano essere stati utilizzati per blend i vini che sono etichettati come brunello che caschino al di fuori del modello statistico dei suoli da dove dovrebbero provenire possono allora essere identificati ed appaiati ai territori di effettiva provenienza

4062381 the question now is are we close to the bottom
4062382 we take the slightly more optimistic opinion that the economy will improve by the end of the year
4062383 the decline reflects a backlash from the strong first quarter as well as a cyclical economic downturn
4062384 high oil prices the euros strength and the weakness in global demand are all clouding the outlook
4062385 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4062386 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age
4062387 friend everyone that you know even if they hate you
4062388 yet many of the aspects of why a shotgun is utilized in standard defense do not apply to the undead which is why the shotgun should not be the preferred method of anti zombie weaponry
4062389 top 5 reasons you should not use a shotgun for zombie defense
4062390 secondly a shotgun does not need to be precisely on target to hit the target since it throws out a number of projectiles
4062391 your first order of business is to escape not fight especially if you are on your own firing your weapon should be your last resort and only if spotted since the report of the weapon will draw more
4062392 second if this is based on the average person they cant aim the spread of a shot gun makes aiming obsolete
4062393 just point at the head and pull the trigger baby
4062394 the only way to defeat is to band together and you need to use all sorts of tools to let your human presence be known as well as seeking out other humans barricading yourself in your room is in hopes that some group will eventually defeat the zombies and youll be safe a real american will be part of the group that hunts and defeats the zombies
4062395 i have always wondered if a flame thorougher may be more effective than any gun a garden sprayer filled with kerosene and a lighter may work better at least if your outside with nothing to burn but zombies and you can get them in any country
4062396 one should always carry a samurai sword for quick beheadings
4062397 i would want a 9mm because thats what all the gangstas use
4062398 the only weapon guaranteed to put a permanent hurt on the zombies is a full auto aa 12
4062399 you ladies ought to consider that when our ancestors faced the rise of the living dead they had no firearms whatsoever

4062427 prospect has done the managements job for them in divide and rule it has driven a wedge between the unions
4062428 we sat down afterwards and looked more closely at the figures

4062496 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4062497 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities

4062510 het is echt jammer dat we nog niemand met uitzondering van de nederlanders peter schep en jens mouris hebben bezig gezien
4062511 als ik de anderen bezig zie dan krijg ik altijd een beetje stress en dat heb ik nodig bovendien kunnen we nu ook totaal niet inschatten waar de anderen staan er was echt weinig volk soms reed er slechts tien man rond

4062534 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4062535 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms

4062539 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
4062540 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
4062541 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
4062542 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean
4062543 wenn ber altersstrukturen diskutiert wird ist es notwendig zu kl ren was alter berhaupt f r den einzelnen bedeutet
4062544 zonen des bergangs dimensionen und deutungsmuster des alterns bei jungen lteren und alten menschen
4062545 die entscheidung in welcher altersphase sich ein mensch befindet ist von vielen faktoren abh ngig und sehr stark individuell gepr gt
4062546 aber auch soziale strukturen etwa der bildungsstand oder die einbindung in soziale netzwerke spielen eine wichtige rolle bei der selbstwahrnehmung des alters
4062547 wie stellen sich junge menschen das hohe alter vor wie haben es die alten tats chlich erlebt das sind spannende gegen berstellungen f r unsere arbeit
4062548 die zusammensetzung der projektgruppe erlaubt es empirisch ein breites feld der subjektiven alterserfahrung zu ber cksichtigen und aufeinander zu beziehen
4062549 durch die angek ndigten umbr che und den resultierenden umbau des sozialstaates beginnt eine neuverhandlung ber die rolle der alten in der gesellschaft
4062550 wir m chten ankn pfungspunkte liefern eine gelungene lebensf hrung im h heren und hohen alter aufzubauen vielleicht sogar politisches handeln anzuleiten und uns damit der demografischen herausforderung stellen
4062551 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
4062552 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
4062553 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
4062554 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
4062555 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
4062556 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
4062557 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet

4062561 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
4062562 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
4062563 it also appears and i tend to believe this based on reader mail that some savvy individuals who had leaned toward obama actually decided to do some cursory research on the candidate
4062564 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
4062565 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black

4062588 in georgien ist trotz des waffenstillstands keine ruhe eingekehrt dennoch ergehen die eu au enminister sich in selbstgef lligkeit und freuen sich dar ber dass moskau den vom franz sischen pr sidenten nicolas sarkozy vorgeschlagenen friedensplan akzeptierte dabei haben die russen sich durchgesetzt und ihren willen bekommen ihre vorherrschaft im kaukasus wurde best tigt f r die eu und die usa bleibt nur eine m glichkeit ihre rolle in dem konflikt zu verbessern sie k nnten die aufnahme georgiens in die nato beschleunigen und moskau damit zeigen dass die invasion eines souver nen staates nicht ungestraft bleibt
4062589 neben applaus im regierungslager f r pr sident sarkozys vermittlungsmission im georgien konflikt ist in frankreich auch etwas kritik an mangelnder standfestigkeit gegen ber russland zu verzeichnen der sechs punkte plan beruht vor allem auf russischen forderungen und kann von putin nach belieben zu moskaus gunsten ausgelegt werden auf der pressekonferenz mit putins sprachrohr medwedew in moskau hatte sarkozy es als normal bezeichnet dass russland sich auch f r die interessen der russen au erhalb seiner landesgrenzen einzusetzen suche diese feststellung schien einer anerkennung der doktrin von russlands sonderinteressen im nahen ausland bedenklich nahe zu kommen im unterschied zu den drei baltischen staaten sowie zu polen und der ukraine war jedoch in frankreich dar ber keinerlei konsternation zu verzeichnen

4062591 der westen diskutiert im rahmen von eu und nato wie man sich gegen ber russland nach dessen bertriebener machtanwendung gegen ein kleines nachbarland verhalten soll dass eine solche diskussion stattfindet ist nat rlich weil es kein patentrezept f r die richtige reaktion gibt erneut wird ber isolierung oder vielleicht sogar boykott im gegensatz zu konstruktivem engagement gestritten letzteres ist wohl das richtige allerdings nur bei klaren voraussetzungen russland muss klargemacht werden dass es international nicht nach eigenen regeln spielen und keinen besonderen einfluss in teilen der fr heren sowjetunion beanspruchen kann durch sein vorgehen in georgien hat russland dem eigenen ruf und sich selbst geschadet die harte machtanwendung widerspricht moskaus eigener behauptung dass man ein verl sslicher partner in sachen energie oder in den politischen beziehungen sei
4062592 sie condoleezza rice darf neben der unterst tzung f r georgiens demokratie keinen zweifel daran lassen dass es keine milit rische l sung im streit mit russland geben kann und dass die amerikanischen kampfflieger und kriegsschiffe die jetzt auf dem weg nach georgien sind nur hilfsg ter liefern sollen die vereinigten staaten und europa haben diese g rende krise zu lange ignoriert pr sident george w bush wollte alle seiten bedienen er schmeichelte dem georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili als dieser moskau reizte und sah dann weg als putin seine nachbarn tyrannisierte us vertreter sagen zwar dass sie georgiens staatschef davor gewarnt h tten truppen nach s dossetien zu schicken und damit moskau in die falle zu gehen offensichtlich waren sie dabei aber nicht berzeugend genug

4062597 die erstkonsolidierung darf nicht untersch tzt werden insbesondere bei einer akquisition die in unserem fall den konzern um zweidrittel erweitert hat man muss sich im voraus ber die auswirkungen im klaren sein um im nachhinein richtig kommunizieren und steuern zu k nnen

4062601 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4062602 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4062603 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4062604 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4062605 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4062616 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4062617 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4062618 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4062619 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4062620 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4062621 our delegate assembly this year addressed a number of key issues facing nursing regulation today and met these challenges head on ever mindful of our goal of protecting the public two historically significant accomplishments were made with the addition of the first advanced practice board of nursing member to ncsbn and the first international nursing regulator associate member of ncsbn i am proud of the work that was done throughout the past year and know that this vital work will continue under the direction of the many dedicated individuals who give back to nursing regulation through their service
4062622 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4062623 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4062666 what we want to try to communicate is that we just do not do this sort of wage we dont pay that sort of money to anyone
4062667 if we could wave a magic wand and maybe get in another one or two then we would but its not a case of bringing people in just for the sake of it
4062668 theyve got to be the right players and if we dont we still think were in good shape anyway

4062693 it is not possible for the teacher of a big class to meet the learner characteristics of each learner all the time over a number of lessons teachers can try to vary how they teach so that they can meet the needs of a range of learners
4062694 efl learners are not all the same they do not all learn the same way

4062854 its a bit cheeky for the police to say that we had to be rescued when for starters we werent in any danger and secondly they were the ones who had confiscated our safety boat this morning
4062855 the river police were very professional and courteous unlike their landlubbing equivalents
4062856 it shows how serious we are about stopping climate change that people from all walks of life were prepared despite blatantly intimidatory policing to take direct action to disrupt e on this olympic effort certainly deserves a gold medal
4062857 its been a great today but a real victory for us will be when we have conclusively scuppered e ons coal fuelled mania if hutton gives the green light to this power plant e on can expect to be seeing a lot more of us in the future
4062858 malcolm wicks claim that building an unabated coal fired power station at kingsnorth is necessary to save us from climate change shows him to be delusional and dangerously scientifically illiterate
4062859 but whats really crazy is that government and business are not seriously committed to combating climate change
4062860 when we heard theyd raided the camp and seized life jackets our hearts dropped
4062861 it was irresponsible and could have put lives at risk
4062862 we weighed up the risks and researched this carefully before deciding on this peaceful action to shut down kingsnorth today the threat posed to our climate change targets by the governments proposed new generation of coal fired power stations is so great that we are prepared to do this occupation to ensure kingsnorth is shut for the day climate change driven by carbon dinosaurs such as kingsnorth already kills 160 000 people a year according to the world health organisation it is utter madness to build new coal burning plants when we need urgent and deep cuts in our carbon emissions
4062863 our people are really happy that weve been able to get this process locked down particularly with the elections coming up what we will focus on now is to bring the recognition back of what our ancestors were trying to achieve
4062864 its surprising what international visitors do not see so they dont recognize even design elements in a brochure as being maori internationals are not even at that stage new zealand is foreign enough so they kind of see maori culture as a new zealand thing theyre just not distinguishing the nuances of different cultures within new zealand
4062865 i was looking at how pre european tribes down there used the land how they used the resources and then how the resources have been compromised by the burgeoning colony of us so that set of pics is a set of images that shows the parts of the south island where pounamu came from
4062866 we believe we could offer something i dont know what it is but were prepared to come to the table and have a range of activities that might inspire the kaupapa of the facility and were keen to build that picture
4062867 if they were only ever going to go with labour then theyre just and adjunct of the labour party and the whole purpose of the maori party as i see it is to give an independent voice for maoridom which can oscillate between whoevers in government be it labour or national and look aut and strike the best deals that can get the greatest representation for maori people and if they are only going to do that with a labour government history tells you at various times they will be locked out of the debate
4062868 most people just want to do the right thing by their patients but need a bit of guidance what are the differences what are the things to look out for the majority of the people on the dvd half of them at least are non maori practitioners talking about the things they have done to deliver better consultations for their maori patients

4062891 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4062892 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4062893 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4062894 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4062895 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4062896 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4062897 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4062898 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4062899 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do

4062902 during the quarter we have made significant progress on several management and operational areas important to restarting mining concentrate production and shipping submission of our draft plans marked a major step forward in the approval process in the current third quarter we received responses to these plans from all relevant government agencies and the incorporation of these comments into our plans is almost complete this will allow final plans to be submitted to the minister in compliance with his requirement for us to meet his stringent conditions for his formal approval to allow shipping of our product through fremantle we are confident our plans which have been subjected to extensive review comment and consultation will meet the ministers expectations good progress was also made in formalizing our commitment to contribute to esperance and the lead related clean up in order to allow the community to move forward from the events of 2007
4062903 we recognize it has been a long process but our future method of shipment is completely different and requires substantial review planning and high level approval we believe we are on the home stretch and every effort is being made to complete this in the most efficient and timely manner

4062969 in some cases when we look at patients younger patients with very glandular or very dense breasts and peri menopausal or pre menopausal women that study did conclude digital mammography was the best choice
4062970 we are trying to minimize that impact by continuing to bring in locum support as we have for the last year for mammography

4062984 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4062985 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4062986 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4062995 the bottom line is that the post office network the way it currently stands is just not viable
4062996 it has to be cost effective and able to turn a profit
4062997 if the post office is not being forced to disclose to us what the financial criteria is how can we make a case against any closure
4062998 how many more times can i say that im not in a position to tell you the business position of any individual post office
4062999 its a private concern and a private industry and im not in a position to comment on that and the post office certainly wouldnt want me to
4063000 can you truly say to me that you havent already made you mind up about what is going to happen
4063001 i think that is the case and if so that is very sad
4063002 it tears the heart out of the community to take a post office away from it and we have seen this happen time and time again
4063003 the post office has been left in an impossible situation

4063005 now my husband and i are doing you a great favor by employing you so do not stretch our trust
4063006 as it currently stands we are shorthanded on this day and need a person to do the most important of tasks in the house
4063007 you will be assigned the task of watching over our only child
4063008 she is a very very ill child she must be treated with the utmost care i shall send the other servants to make sure you will do her no mischief understand this is for today only it would be best if you let her alone unless she requires something from you directly
4063009 indeed i have matters of great importance to attend to today i shall be back by nightfall the cook will bring her breakfast and luncheon
4063010 its very nice to meet you you have a nice face and your eyes are very kind
4063011 it was pink and gold the sun was still rising
4063012 it must be beautiful ive never seen the sky except from my window on very nice days
4063013 i used to read before mother took all of my books now i sing i think a lot too
4063014 i dont know they get all twisty after a while
4063015 since i am here all day would you like to hear a story
4063016 and then he took up the bespelled sword and was ready to deal the final blow when
4063017 i saw something when you were telling me the story
4063018 you move your fingers when you tell a story really fast not like a regular person just moving your hands
4063019 see in the east we have thick fog roll in from the forest
4063020 theres a forest out there how big is it are there animals like in the stories
4063021 it is the most beautiful forest there ever was faylyn
4063022 im not sure if i can in the east i would work the mist into forms with my fingers there doesnt seem to be any sort of moisture in this room
4063023 sometimes thats how it goes but you dont have to dwell on it after all we have an entire story to tell here
4063024 and they lived the rest of their days beautifully under the star filled sky
4063025 the other servants tell me youve been here with my daughter all day long
4063026 you were given explicit instructions to leave her be she is a very ill child who knows what mischief an easterner like you could have brought to her
4063027 i assure you mistress my time thus far has been nothing but innocent
4063028 who puts a servant on their first day to watch
4063029 your duties are the same as yesterday i trust you will do them properly this time
4063030 close they are so much more than all that though and not quite faerie either just part of the same world you could say
4063031 i do not simply go to parties all day easterner
4063032 i have to work extremely hard for every piece of what i have maybe not as my husband does but every aspect of the world i inhabit is balanced on the edge of a knife do you understand what i am saying
4063033 dont patronize me we easterners dont bask brainlessly we understand your struggles better than even you do
4063034 is that why you keep her locked up all day shes not sick anyone could see that
4063035 i wondered at why a woman with such a reputation would allow request even myself to be a servant in her house and with such a delicate task on his first day
4063036 i also wondered why the master of the house never consulted with his wife and much less with his daughter i began to ask more questions such as why does she have understanding when clearly no one in this entire city does you fear the child dont you you fear her heritage and what she might do to your precious reputation
4063037 her father is working in the city today he hasnt even met you why would he care what eastern filth i hire
4063038 i didnt mean your darling husband i mean faylyns father
4063039 he felt that i should meet faylyn you had to obey him you fear him too much not to
4063040 they get all of those wrong well not exact anyway they mix them up with pixies and gnomes and those sort of things
4063041 you remember what i told you about faylyn about magic being all around
4063042 out there in the forest theyre all there all of those stories
4063043 would you like to go on an adventure with me faylyn an adventure in the forest
4063044 oh hell that irritating mogambo idiot imi is off on a real tirade lets go get something to eat and drink and we wont give him any hahaha
4063045 in rome 277 bc the denarius was born it was a silver coin and for the first 250 years its silver content declined only modestly the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
4063046 in 54 ad emperor nero started to inflate and debase the value of romes money nero took 14 3 of the silver out of the denarius coin and 11 of the gold out of the aureus coin replacing the precious metals with base metals
4063047 as rome continued on its moral political and monetary decline by 193 ad the denarius had only 26 grains of silver a 61 devaluation from the original 66 grains shortly thereafter romes denarius stopped being accepted in trade by the rest of the world by 268 the denarius was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating
4063048 if we flash forward to the u s in the 1960s we find that in one fell swoop all of the silver was taken out of our coins and replaced with base metals are we rome on steroids
4063049 the financial markets are currently going through their most turbulent period in years the credit crunch continues to bite the dollar is collapsing and taking the pound down with it and a uk recession seems an inevitability commodities prices are going haywire asias on the rise theres a lot for investors to keep on top of and its changing every day thats where the fleet street daily comes in a brand new 100 free service that keeps you plugged into the financial stories that really matter
4063050 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4063051 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4063052 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4063053 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4063073 it just broke my heart because you know there was so much left
4063074 when i woke up that morning he had passed so i didnt get to see him
4063075 the cockroach stunt has been a big hit with guests at all of our parks including magic mountain but as you know halloween is big business in l a so for magic mountain we made the decision to shake things up a bit and do something different
4063076 what we want people to know is that cockroaches might be given a bad rap in society but they do not deserve to be eaten and used as a gratuitous marketing gimmick
4063077 the cockroach stunt may indeed come back at other parks but if we opt not to include it as part of our fright fest entertainment package it will not be because of peta
4063078 there are seven spaces there allocated to the harbour house hotel
4063079 if the plans are approved five of those spaces will be lost and the hotel guests will have to park in the main public car park this will in turn take away more precious parking space used by local residents
4063080 it is impossible to park your car there during the day from april to october due to tourists and it is becoming a lottery to find an overnight space
4063081 it has got to the stage where if you even just nip up to tesco in the evening you cannot get back in
4063082 the law is quite clear a planning applicant must notify people in adjoining properties but not necessarily those people who overlook the site when the plans are registered there will be a window for public comment
4063083 we were relatively lucky considering how much rain fell during the morning
4063084 the ground was wet but the only real problem we had was beside the tea tent where it was quite muddy
4063085 we had to switch the line dancing demonstration from the outside stage to the bingo tent the only casualty the highland dancing had already been cancelled a change of date for the north berwick highland games saw to that
4063086 i would like to thank all those who helped in whatever way to once again make the gala day a success despite the appalling weather
4063087 the gala committee are as ever very grateful to all the staff from east lothian council who helped in the lead up to the gala day and on the day itself and to the many local businesses who contributed
4063088 the way man accepts his destiny is more important that the destiny itself
4063089 ci dumnezeu si a ales pe cele nebune ale lumii ca sa rusineze pe cei intelepti dumnezeu a ales lucrurile slabe ale lumii ca sa faca de rusine pe cele tari
4063090 i write these words as a person who is best described by the term idiot idiotes a private person a man holding no office a layman an ordinary fellow
4063091 some members of the business association say they dont see the parking warden for quite some time and that he is only visible on sundays
4063092 there is this perception within the business community that the parking warden is only here on sunday mornings which does not do us any favours at all we need a solution to it
4063093 on sundays a traffic warden is drafted in solely to cover north berwick the rest of the week the traffic warden covers north berwick dirleton and gullane
4063094 usually we have a warden patrolling north berwick seven days a week it is partly due to a request from the community council that he does so
4063095 the trip to dunbar was arranged before i realised it was such an important anniversary
4063096 im just sorry i did not have more time to spend with them but it was a real honour
4063097 everyone is invited to the party not just people from dunbar but the county as a whole
4063098 the very first lifeboat in dunbar was bought with money from people from all over the county and this 200th anniversary celebration is our way of saying a big thank you to everyone for their support
4063099 dunbar is one of the oldest established lifeboats stations in the uk and we are very proud to be at this stage its an institution which has brought great honour to east lothian
4063100 this administration recognises the publics concerns about the questionnaire leaflet however people should not see the questionnaire as the only means of making a statement and i would encourage them to contact their local councillor or to write in to the council
4063101 i can assure you that this administration takes the views and concerns of local residents seriously on such an important matter
4063102 its a private concern and a private industry and im not in a position to comment on that and the post office certainly wouldnt want me to
4063103 can you truly say to me that you havent already made you mind up about what is going to happen i think that is the case and if so that is very sad
4063104 it tears the heart out of the community to take a post office away from it and we have seen this happen time and time again
4063105 the post office has been left in an impossible situation
4063106 gifford is the most compelling case i think weve got in east lothian
4063107 when i first saw it i thought it was a rubber snake
4063108 but then it slithered away from me and i realised it was the real thing
4063109 ive found bats knifes and all sorts of things in cars but never a snake
4063110 you would have thought there was a cobra trapped in there
4063111 that car had been about to go through the crusher so this was one very lucky snake
4063112 weve known the imries for 12 years i used to work with frank and we were keen to help them in any way we could
4063113 when we heard that fraser needed a new wheelchair we got to work organising the dinner right away i have written to numerous local companies asking for their support and so far the response has been encouraging
4063114 but we still have a number of tables at the dinner to be sold and every pound raised is vital
4063115 we are absolutely delighted with andrew and patricias efforts to arrange the fund raiser and cant thank them enough we have had a lot of problems with frasers current electric wheelchair which is now a number of years old but we cant get the type of reclining wheelchair he requires on the nhs
4063116 he has breathing difficulties and finds it easier to breath when he is in a reclined position
4063117 we hope that more people will add their weight to the fundraising campaign to help us reach our target

4063129 my party has already held its convention without a single taxpayer dollar in its support
4063130 it probably doesnt surprise a lot of people that sen barack obamas party is trying to pry more money out of government after all democrats have perfected the art of using a political crowbar to bust open the treasurys doors but why is sen john mccain supposed maverick and reformer going along with the raid how is he any different than any of the other people who fill washington clamoring for a bailout
4063131 unfortunately too many people spend too much time prying money from the feds
4063132 and both parties are to blame its easier to list the groups that dont get federal handouts than those that fill their pockets every year with a half trillion dollar deficit and a 9 5 trillion national debt we obviously cant afford to have all of these people breaking into the treasury all the time
4063133 but what can be more obnoxious than forcing taxpayers to underwrite other peoples political opinions as thomas jefferson told us to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions that he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical youd think someone who postures as an opponent of special interests and government pork wouldnt expect the taxpayers to subsidize his own very special interest political campaign
4063134 it wont be senators barack obama or john mccain both of whom are creatures of the washington establishment sen obama talks about a new politics but his policies look an awful lot like the old liberalism sen mccain says he is a maverick but that doesnt include getting his own political party off of the federal dole when he does break with his own party he lines up with the democrats whenever the issue is individual rights versus government power he chooses government power
4063135 even if the terrorists do strike again on american soil my hometown and my family probably arent in danger

4063175 too few young people are taking science technology engineering and mathematics subjects
4063176 the main barriers are the need for quality teaching perceived difficulties of the subjects and negative views held about careers within the industry
4063177 somewhere along the line we are letting young people down by not opening their eyes to the huge potential of a career in technology
4063178 we need a curriculum that embraces creativity and that employers help to develop
4063179 the school curriculum also has a knock on effect into higher education and employment as students wrongly presume that school ict courses are an indicator of the content of it related degree courses and careers
4063180 bowling is something that most people see as an activity they can do in their hometown
4063181 when you think about the pro football hall of fame in canton or the national baseball hall of fame in cooperstown you think of heroes to be admired and a sport that is not something you can aspire to

4063228 within the mtv networks north region we are aiming to improve our channel presentation by managing content directly and more efficiently from the desktop
4063229 we needed a unified workflow for all operations under a single enterprise with browse at every desktop
4063230 we also aimed to open up existing transmission operations to make publishing accessible directly to the channel management teams delivering higher video and audio quality by minimising transcoding steps throughout entire process to offer digital delivery was also a priority
4063231 we chose the pharos mediator platform because it offers close integration with our key third party subsystems including apple final cut mediagenix whats on and publitronic nexua pharos delivers efficient processes and better workflows between these systems
4063232 we were impressed by pharos ability to respond to many of our specific needs within mtvn operations
4063233 mediator improves operational efficiency particularly in handling multiple versions of content subtitles and multi language audio
4063234 our new system also allows secure remote operations which is sometimes a good thin occasionally our staff use mediator with browse to check or approve material when away from the office
4063235 when we launched envy post we wanted to start off on the right foot with an advanced booking and scheduling management system and my previous experience with scheduall led me to recommend it strongly over any other solution
4063236 schedualls ability to provide a high level view of all projects and their associated resources data and billing information has made the system a critical element in our success
4063237 scheduall makes our lives a lot easier by saving time helping our producers to be more productive and giving us the intelligence we need to make informed decisions for future resource allocations
4063238 this has been especially important as weve expanded to two locations with a third opening soon
4063239 scheduall was specifically designed to meet the needs of companies like envy post that are dealing with rapid growth and an explosion of information that needs to be accessed and managed efficiently throughout the lifecycle of a video project

4063298 acum cateva zile ma aflam la politia rutiera din constanta pentru a raporta catvea zgarieturi ocazie cu care politistii au fost extrem de
4063299 hoookay someone is crazy in the coco nut and im not pointing no fingers at r zvan

4063304 how does real learning and real change to occur that is not just a repetition of the past
4063305 and the forces shaping a situation can move from recreating the past to manifesting an emerging future
4063306 should i be concerned that as of march 18 th i have no formally defined goals in my performance evaluation tool ive asked for them my manager is busy but i work on two key and highly visible initiatives and id like to know what my success criteria is for the year

4063309 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4063310 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4063311 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4063312 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4063313 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4063314 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4063315 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4063316 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4063317 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4063318 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4063319 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4063320 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4063321 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4063322 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4063323 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4063324 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4063325 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4063326 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4063327 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4063328 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4063329 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
4063330 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more

4063400 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshops
4063401 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them

4063403 three kangaroos that would have been in the 220 pound 100 kilogram size range
4063404 there was a marsupial leopard which was probably 100 to 220 pounds 50 to 100 kilograms in weight
4063405 there was also what i would call a marsupial ground sloth that weighed several hundred kilograms at least and perhaps in excess of 1 000 pounds 500 kilogram
4063406 and then a thing that you might want to call a marsupial hippopotamus or a marsupial tapir which would have weighed about 1 000 pounds 500 kilograms

4063409 in the americas 13 000 years ago the same thing happened in madagascar 2 000 years ago the same thing new zealand 1 000 years ago the same thing
4063410 giant sloths survived for about another 6 000 or 8 000 years after their extinction date on the mainland why because people hadnt gotten to those islands now we are seeing the same thing with tasmania
4063411 we have no evidence of any sort of specialized hunting technology at all its quite likely that these things didnt recognize humans as a threat so perhaps a wooden spear or a club was enough to kill them
4063412 this is a first major step towards understanding what happened in tasmania
4063413 there may very well be others but at the moment thats where it stands

4063429 diminish the power of natural selection to remove slightly deleterious evolutionary changes
4063430 if there were only a few small bands of neanderthals barely hanging on then any change to their way of life could have been enough to drive them to extinction
4063431 one obvious change would have been the introduction of another large hominid modern humans
4063432 at least for the maternal lineage there are no traceable genetic markers that suggest admixture of neanderthals and modern humans
4063433 many more precautions were taken to ensure that no contamination with human dna has flawed the analysis

4063440 most people believe jessica is talking about being abused by a former boyfriend jessica was abused as a teenager while attending j j pearce high school in richardson texas long before she met nick lachey or any of her ex boyfriends
4063441 jessica was well developed and every guy in high school wanted her and practically every girl hated her
4063442 jessica put on a brave face but it was a campaign of terror that just devastated her
4063443 a nasty clique of girls constantly spread rumors about jessica and one that spread like wildfire was that she was gay

4063698 this general evenness and smoothness of sedimentary layers throughout the geologic column is rather odd especially considering the fact that the current weathering rate for the continents of today averages about 6cm thousand years for the continental shelves this means that in less than 10 million years the entire continental shelves of today would be washed into the oceans to be replaced by new underlying materials

4063701 as for b witness the glut of videos of taser ees who dont seem to pose much of an actual threat to police themselves or anyone else who get the shock treatment for little more than mouthing off being uncooperative or otherwise not showing due deference and respect to a police officer i think you should in most cases show due deference and respect to a police officer but people who dont oughtnt be subjected to a paralyzing jolt of electricity not unless they pose a threat there are better ways of dealing with people than assaulting them even if you do think not immediately obeying a police officers orders warrants a stun there have been plenty of incidents in the news over the last few months showing how such a policy can go wrong see the stories about taserings of people in insulin shock people who dont speak english and cant understand officer commands or like the story above people who simply cant hear for example

4063724 the onus should be on the people at youtube not to let things like this appear
4063725 childrens lives are far more precious than a couple of hits on youtube
4063726 this girls photo should be made public so her parents know what shes doing
4063727 she could be a lovely young girl but if shes been drinking with her friends they could all think this is a bit of fun

4063733 these wealthy young girls are part of a group called the national charity league the event called a senior presentation is a day to celebrate each girls journey to becoming a woman and their new found independence as they graduate from high school it is a day where all of the high class families from carmel valley la jolla california emerge to show off their daughters societal success the girls wear wedding dresses symbolic of new beginnings and walk alone down a runway in a grand ballroom for all of the community to dote upon her it is such an interesting lifestyle to me because it is so different to the life i know the amount of money that goes into these events is exorbitant and it sets the tone for these girls a life of high class
4063734 i love completely immersing myself into a different lifestyle and being able to share that experience with others i love how photography pushes me to see in different ways i love the way it makes me think and how observant it has made me
4063735 it is such an interesting medium because it captures moments moments that will never happen again and no one will see them the same way that you do and through a photograph you are able to share your vision and that is an incredible gift by being able to share your personal vision you have the power to make a difference and to inspire
4063736 my photography the way i see does not fall into a particular genre it just is it is me photography is my lifestyle i document the moments that happen around me intimate relationships social cultural issues natural beauty raw emotion vivid life i want to bring the viewer into the moment completely so they can stare at my image and delve into the emotions of my subject

4063744 proteins need dna to be manufactured dna needs proteins to be manufactured how could they have originated at the same time god did it
4063745 it follows that if evolution by natural selection is to occur functional proteins must form a continuous network which can be traversed by unit mutational steps without passing through nonfunctional intermediates
4063746 t he current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an alreadyfunctioning system
4063747 t he difficult task facing darwinian evolution however would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre existing systems it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place
4063748 religion in this question is bigotry but it is misleading so i will answer the basic cell is abiogenesis not evolution on replicators but scientists have tentative answers rna is the intermediate to make proteins it is a hereditary molecule in some virus organelles dna is stabler and makes larger genomes so it is most likely that dna is later rna function like proteins the core of the ribosome that makes protein is rna this molecular fossil implies that rna also came before proteins

4063766 people tend to sort each other into categories and the question is in which one do we land

4063769 the central question is does the ringtone suit me and the company
4063770 i am an absolute fan of the simpsons and for years have had the television comedy shows theme song on my cellphone

4063794 as you know we are from kano and our company is based in kano doing football business and i dont see why we can not help out kano pillars to look for a better coach that can take this club to greater heights many critics put eyes on pillars to see if the club will perform better when the league commences that is why we decided to go round and help pillars to come out with the best man that will handle the club for next seasons domestic league and continental

4063883 nearly one in 10 obstetricians consider giving up medical practice because of the mental toll of stillbirths and infant deaths
4063884 its part of human nature to feel that every task should be done with perfection so when the result is not so you tend to feel guilty this in turn has an adverse effect on your self esteem
4063885 there is yet another fear that of being reported we regularly hear cases of doctors being sued and the consumer protection forum giving judgments in favour of patients fear of being pulled to court and lack of sympathisers often leads to mental disturbance in doctors
4063886 stillbirths do not occur because of the doctors fault it may be due to reasons like diabetes or other diseases during pregnancy

4063889 one of our concerns is that the reactor seems to have doubled in size
4063890 originally it was to be a 110mw reactor and the idea was to use banks of these modules to supply large amounts of power the size of the module was increased to 165mw after doubts had been raised about its viability but now the firm of consulting engineers doing the environmental impact study is advertising that they are looking at a plant to produce 400mw
4063891 its a unique opportunity to stand near the heart of a nuclear reactor
4063892 its a humbling experience not too many people are afforded that opportunity
4063893 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry wales said today at the global brand forum in singapore
4063894 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4063895 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4063896 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes said wales

4063899 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways wales said
4063900 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians he said
4063901 i dont know exactly whats going to happen but i am generally optimistic because i see that ordinary people actually do love to engage with the issues and actually talk about things in detail

4063914 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
4063915 our members are facing the reality of a five per cent inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs

4063927 it is most unlikely that resources available for health care on the island are being used to maximum benefit for the population concerned particularly in the border region and the interests of institutions are being placed ahead of the health and safety of the population
4063928 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group have enough experience and quality to win
4063929 i want to thank everyone who took part and all the supporters for the wonderful amount raised we were able to buy an eye imaging camera
4063930 this new one means there is no need for eye drops something all children hate and children can even sit on their mums lap as the camera is hand held
4063931 on the marathon day some of the nurses acted as marshalls along the route and we were also able to help with coffee in the park
4063932 extra cash was raised by my great niece emily and some of the children in my road who sold cakes from a stall in compton they also sold toys and drinks and raised 25 which i think was great
4063933 we have also been collecting in supermarkets and collecting in the streets
4063934 it detracts from the general amenities enjoyed by the neighbours it is crammed
4063935 however in my view i do not consider that the intensity of comings and goings would be so marked as to represent a significant interference with living conditions either to the front or rear windows of the dwelling
4063936 a bid came in on wednesday night and it was immediately rejected
4063937 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4063938 emotions such as anger depression and tension can accompany increases in fatigue when individuals believe their ability to achieve their goal of for example winning their race or match at the olympic games is under threat
4063939 but the competitors who view feelings of fatigue as a necessary part of achieving their goal of winning a medal or gaining a personal best are more able to repair negative emotions that can jeopardise performance at the highest level
4063940 kightly isnt going anywhere because we have ambitions of our own
4063941 people ask if someone came in and made an offer because players always find out if there has been an offer would it turn his head
4063942 ive only ever dreamed of winning an olympic medal since i was six years old and im so close now
4063943 there was a lot of pressure on me because the olympics is the biggest sporting event going and it has been a long week for me with the rest of the team doing so well that added to the pressure
4063944 their search for identity and a sense of direction is undermined by a twisted popular culture that focuses on the bling bling of fast money associated with famous basketball players rap artists drug dealers and the idea that women are at their best when flaunting their sexuality and having babies
4063945 in a bling culture criminality easily becomes a short cut to symbols of wealth and power that will otherwise take years of hard work to achieve
4063946 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart
4063947 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
4063948 i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight
4063949 didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4063950 currently bhp has negligible exposure to platinum and may consider impala platinum the worlds second largest platinum producer however we feel that the bid for rio tinto may preoccupy the company for any action this year
4063951 on barclayss credit market exposures we believe there is the potential for up to 4 6bn further writedowns these are spread across the whole credit portfolio but some may take longer to crystalise as they sit within the loan book we forecast 1 5bn further writedowns over the next 18 months as we believe exposures could move closer to other marks in the market
4063952 we are convinced astrazeneca will buy protherics otherwise it could be paying annual royalties in excess of 1bn a year
4063953 what will they pay a premium to the price on the screen how much will astrazeneca pay in order not to pay out more than 1bn a year doubtless the market will capitulate at a price which undervalues the company we remain buyers with a 100p price target
4063954 having already out licensed the lead drug cytofab we see little reason why astrazeneca would acquire protherics until at least the full phase iib results are known 2010 we see limited reason why a blue chip pharma would make a cash offer in the current climate while the execution risk remains high as such we expect the approaches are share based and from relatively minor players in the pharmaceutical space and we retain our 29p price target and urge investors to sell into the strength that these approaches have created

4063960 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of
4063961 but i dont think were going to get anything out of it in the suburbs
4063962 this is the chicago olympics not the cook county olympics or the illinois olympics
4063963 for us to get out front and support the olympics i dont think it would be in our interest were concentrating on how to provide the same quality of life to our residents its very difficult to think about something as esoteric as the olympics when were worried about garbage collection
4063964 it would definitely create more awareness of cycling as a sport not just recreation

4063979 in the last seven or eight years we have seen a significant shift in attitude within the public sector especially in local government which has been leading the way these initiatives have helped up the ante many people saw customer services as something for the private sector but that is no longer the case
4063980 for many residents all they are after is a convenient way to pay their council tax and report things such as fly tipping or an abandoned car
4063981 however for others their needs are more complex for someone who lives in social housing and is claiming a range of benefits you may need to deal with them face to face there may be rent to sort out council tax to pay perhaps subsidising school meals and uniforms it is a different relationship
4063982 in 2003 lambeth council signed a new contract with its parking contractor control plus the contract included thresholds that reduced the contractors income if specified levels of ticketing were not met arguably these operated as incentives to issue more tickets appeals against unfair tickets shot up by 71 per cent in a matter of weeks the press was full of lurid stories about over zealous ticketing and claims that parking attendants were under pressure to meet targets and maximise the contractors income by the time of the council elections in may parking had become a key is in several marginal wards all the political parties offered new approaches to parking enforcement our preference was to renegotiate the contract immediately to remove the financial incentives following our election win councillors confronted sceptical town hall officers with the unwelcome news that we were serious about renegotiating the contract without a precedent lambeths transport staff were going to have to break new ground following a clear political steer officers moved fast and completed negotiations within months by october the council was ready to announce a new contract that would no longer rely on financial incentives in an attempt to simplify the contract the 21 areas of activity previously monitored have been reduced to just nine
4063983 becoming a customer focused authority is one of the key drivers behind the governments improvement agenda but how can it be achieved it is important to think about customer focus from a variety of angles in order to get it right first there is the context you are working from to consider which could be determined by national or local priorities or by your community strategy or simply from the point of view of direct customer feedback the drivers behind improvement are also crucial to consider is improvement being led by vision leadership partnership the e government agenda or performance management structural and staff development and internal and external communications are also areas that need to be looked at then there is the type of customer contact your remit covers are they paying customers beneficiaries eg benefits recipients obligates eg recipients of child protection citizens receiving indirect benefits or a combination of all types obviously different types of customers have different needs and this has to be taken into account at the very start of the process of improvement
4063984 this problem can be solved with an investment of say 1 million however for services to improve policy makers need to find 20 million over five years
4063985 yes i do have a business model but it is secret
4063986 ah we told you so they only want to make money
4063987 it all went very well despite the wet conditions the day before on the day itself we didnt do too badly weatherwise
4063988 attendance was good and were very grateful to tesco for sponsoring the double decker bus which brought people to and from the show all day and a big thanks goes to the stewartry rugby club for the excellent facilities the trade stands were full and had a good day
4063989 we want to try anything which will broaden the appeal of the show for both local people and visitors to educate people about the stewartry and the farming community
4063990 it seems to be a general trend but we had a good turnout of excellent stock at the show im very pleased with how it all went
4063991 its just unfortunate that its happened in the opening weekend of the season for the club it would have probably been better if id made this decision a couple of months ago and allowed the manager to prepare his own pre season
4063992 its got to the stage with my family that theyve got to come first and i couldnt let it run any longer i cant put the same input into the football as i would normally do
4063993 ive got a contract with the club and i wont be looking to get involved anywhere else i need to sort a lot of stuff out and i need to spend more time with my kids
4063994 anybody who knows me knows that its all or nothing with football and right now im not willing to be 50 50 with it
4063995 ive no regrets the committee have been a joy to work with and the players have been a dream theyre all players ive brought in i know i will regret making this decision but its got to be done at the moment
4063996 its been the best couple of years in my whole career
4063997 weve taken the club forward from the first season when we won the league and the challenge cup to last season when we moved into the top half of the east premier
4063998 we also had the highest finish for the south team and the youth cup run was also something theyd never achieved before
4063999 i was hoping to be there for five seasons and had a five year plan obviously the first objective was to win the first division and try to establish the south team and the under 19s a bit stronger the next stage was to surpass annan and finish in the top half
4064000 from this season we were looking to compete higher up i still believe that can be achieved this year there are a group of 14 players that im convinced can compete in the top half and take strides forward
4064001 theyre getting a group of players that are second to none they have enthusiasm for the game commitment desire and theyre a disciplined bunch none of them ever missed training
4064002 they are honest lads and if the 14 that are there now i wouldnt swap for anyone in this area if somebody could add one possibly two to that group theres a firm base there to work from
4064003 pauls family has to come first its nothing to do with football and we just have to accept that
4064004 how do you replace him hes taken us to the highest placing in the east premier
4064005 ive played there myself about three or four times with annan and ive watched games so i know the area and the park quite well but i dont really know how theyve been doing in their league this year
4064006 its a game to go up to and i still fancy our chances of going up there and getting a result
4064007 we could have got a lot harder teams to play but we know if we can play well we can win were looking forward to it its a wee change playing against a different team on a different park were certainly going up there to get a result and hopefully well get something out of it
4064008 i thought we did ok they were a goal up and we matched them for the first hour but when we lost another goal we started chasing the game i think stranraer will be in the top two or three at the end of the season as i was quite impressed by them
4064009 clark felt he needed a fresh challenge he scored 37 goals last season and was looking for a change and we wish him the best of luck
4064010 you cant get much tougher theyre the form team at the moment
4064011 itll certainly be a hard game and well just have to see what happens on the day and what sort of squad we have to pick from well see how it goes
4064012 whatever they bring well be more than up for the battle were not that easy to beat at home hopefully well get a good crowd and put a good show on
4064013 if its anything like the threave game the fans will certainly be well enough entertained
4064014 our secretary brian mellon put the nets up at eight oclock and got soaked we left it to ten oclock and it was still quite bad so we phoned annan to tell them it was looking doubtful and wed give it as long as we could if they were quite happy to leave it to half 11
4064015 we left it until then and it was still bouncing and puddles were forming on the pitch so we had to call it off

4064036 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4064037 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4064038 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4064039 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4064043 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4064044 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4064045 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4064046 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4064047 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4064048 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4064049 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4064052 china should listen to other partners concerns but they should also listen to what china has to say
4064053 the sed is not a negotiating table but a forum at which the two sides can better understand each other and understand the logic behind their respective policies
4064054 when the conditions warrant quick revaluation we can move quickly and when they are suitable for slower revaluation we have to move moderately
4064055 the pace should depend on the conditions and not be set arbitrarily
4064056 the processing industries many of which import parts and export finished products are the main drivers behind chinas trade surplus so the appreciation would not necessarily curb it because a revaluation could also make the imported parts cheaper and encourage the processing industries to import more

4064070 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4064071 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4064072 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4064073 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4064074 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4064075 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4064076 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4064077 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4064078 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4064079 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4064080 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4064081 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4064082 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4064083 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4064084 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4064085 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4064086 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4064087 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4064088 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4064089 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4064090 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4064091 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4064092 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4064093 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4064094 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4064095 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4064096 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4064097 they always used to know exactly where pedestrians would be on the crossing now they could be absolutely anywhere and it is an accident waiting to happen
4064098 in the meantime we have put extra staff and signage in place to ensure passengers are fully aware of the crossing closure and are directed to the most appropriate crossing point
4064099 my accreditation was in my pocket but they wouldnt let me get it out to show them
4064100 i could see that they threw in behind me a yellow tibetan flag or banner i couldnt see exactly what it was
4064101 they are claiming i tried to unfurl a tibet banner i did not at any time try to unfurl a banner and i have never possessed any banner or protest material i was there simply to report on a demonstration not to take part in it in any way
4064102 chinese people are great but shame on the chinese government because they are lying to china
4064103 chinese people have a right to be chinese why cant tibetans have the right to be tibetan china is illegally occupying my country we are proud to be tibetan we will never give up this is a non violent war

4064118 richard diebenkorn artist and carey stanton collector their stanford connection
4064119 the sculpture crew gets people from all sorts of departments
4064120 for art students its a great way to further their education by seeing how much maintenance is required for certain kinds of sculptures
4064121 but also we know that stanford students are the ones who will purchase art donate art and become the patrons of the arts in the future
4064122 its a nice way to take a break from studying
4064123 its great if you like hauling hoses getting wet and being in the sun when the weather is so great
4064124 plus its a good job to have because its really self directed
4064125 with this job you get to see many different parts of campus
4064126 you get to work in lifts and harnesses you get to touch and climb on the statues in the museum and youre invited to museum openings its particularly valuable for people making sculptures to see the amount of maintenance required and when you work with the outdoor pieces it helps artists understand the logistics of sculpting
4064127 even if we removed the patina from this bronze sculpture itll be back once the water is turned back on
4064128 these purple areas you dont see naturally with bronze they might be caused by some kind of chemical in the water
4064129 its mainly art majors who are on the crew but even so you learn a lot about the art over time
4064130 now if i go around to different cities ill see a sculpture and think oh its a moore ive learned to appreciate the sculptures more and now sometimes ill get annoyed when i see them dirty or vandalized
4064131 people ride their skateboards and bikes on the calder and the spokes end up tearing the paint
4064132 but its an antibiotic it cant be making you depressed
4064133 this equity could grow dramatically if the results of dr schatzbergs government sponsored research find that mifepristone could be used to treat psychotic major depression
4064134 appropriate steps were taken to prevent bias or actual conflict of interest
4064135 dr schatzberg did not select or screen the participants treat the participants or consult on the treatment they received collect the data from the participants visits or analyze the data
4064136 it would not have been appropriate for him to do so
4064137 so the question arises how could dr schatzberg monitor the research funded with his nih grants if he was not involved closely in the study
4064138 despite our belief that stanford nimh and dr schatzberg have handled this grant in accordance with the regulations and applicable policies and with due regard for the integrity of the research
4064139 we can see how having dr schatzberg continue as the principal investigator on the grant can create an appearance of conflict of interest

4064141 everybody reported increasing disability as they get older especially since were talking about people who were around 60 when they started
4064142 however we found that over time the runners group had very low levels of disability that increased very slowly the controls on the other hand had disability that increased much more quickly at the end of the study the difference between the disability levels was very dramatic
4064143 so not only were they less disabled but they lived longer as well
4064144 we statistically adjusted for many factors such as obesity and age
4064145 we also chose pretty healthy people in our control group they were not obese had normal body weight had the same education levels as the runners and didnt drink or smoke much we tried to restrict it so that the main difference between the two groups was running
4064146 adopting an exercising program even in the 50s or 60s will be beneficial down the road were just really excited that were able to show benefits of exercise not only in living longer but living healthier up into the 80s
4064147 we think its probably vigorous exercise in general that produce these results
4064148 even though we chose the groups for running and non running we dont necessarily think that there is anything specific to running that running is better than cycling or swimming or any other form of regular aerobic exercise
4064149 there are three shorts on there that we did after the several year home sick production recovery
4064150 theres a killer mini documentary showing director adam wingards mind state after the turbulent production
4064151 probably one of the most personal and schizophrenic featurettes ive ever seen adam and i also recorded a commentary that was very forthcoming about the shit we went through during the making of the film if like most people you scratch your head after watching the flick this will probably clear up some of your questions
4064152 after such a long road itll be great that people can finally watch this thing zombis relapse artists score can be heard in all its glory and jonathan thorntons grisly fx work can finally splatter the screen

4064170 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4064171 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation

4064223 i want to commend the cma for making these kinds of projections
4064224 i certainly agree with them when you are talking about air quality issues they have a very immediate impact on health
4064225 weve provided a road map for policy makers about where we stand in terms of air quality and they can choose one of two routes act now to improve air quality or reap the consequences by failing to do so
4064226 for sure congratulations to everybody in here working hard this is a beautiful course i can say so far its my favourite place on tour i love that its old and its very traditional the greens are going to be a challenge with different levels the grass is quick
4064227 i really like the setup too i dont think there are going to be many low rounds i think you know for sure its going to be under par but i dont think 15 or 18 or 17 under par so i think thats a good challenge for all us
4064228 on the back nine no 10 and no 18 if you have the driver you can reach the green in two so thats an advantage
4064229 what im trying to do is take advantage of that little extra distance and give myself a few eagle chances
4064230 uh huh i think its an advantage you know thats one of my priorities i always work hard in the off season to get a little more distance im light but im strong i think i have strong legs i do a lot of exercise i have a quick turn that helps me to create speed
4064231 i was ready a few weeks ago yeah i mean im doing okay
4064232 of course its impossible to win every week i got a great start and i slowed down a little bit its the way sport is and life is up and down i played pretty good the last two weeks i finished top 10 in the two weeks and im putting good and hitting the ball good
4064233 you know i just have to be patient like i said im ready for a win hopefully we can do it this week
4064234 win and we have a very good chance for a medal
4064235 win and it would be huge for soccer in canada win and it would be great for our country at these olympics
4064236 lose and were not spending any time thinking about that
4064237 it would not only mean wed advance to the medal round which is our main goal it would mean we finally beat the u s to do that at the olympics would just be so awesome weve been so close so many times
4064238 i think were even a better team than we were the last two times we played them and they arent as good a team as they were then
4064239 when i first started with the team they were beating us 6 0 every single time now were playing the best weve ever played for even this is the time to play them
4064240 but going into a game against them in the olympics it will be different of course whoever can capture that olympic feeling and play their own game will have the best chance
4064241 we have a couple of injuries and of course abby wambach broke her leg just before the tournament
4064242 that is a challenge but those are things you cant do anything about you have to find a way to win
4064243 we have a good feeling for them and familiarity with them but its always a battle the last couple games have been one goal games so well be prepared and excited for that game
4064244 weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
4064245 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
4064246 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
4064247 disappointed yeah because we had some dreams and expectations and it seemed it was going to be easy
4064248 if we really want to compete with the rest of the world then we really need to take a look at ensuring our athletes and coaches have everything they need
4064249 what our current results are telling me is certainly we have a long way to go but im also seeing some positive signs as well
4064250 we realistically dont do well in the first half of the games
4064251 going back as far as montreal 1976 its the fourth or fifth day and as late as the seventh before we get our first medal
4064252 thats why we keep pushing for more investment in sports and why torontos 2015 pan american bid is so important
4064253 i dont believe that a full time high performance athlete in canada has the ability to get enough funding to support themselves on a year round training cycle without having to look elsewhere whether its a part time job or sponsorship of some sort
4064254 theres no question when the proposals went forward we knew full well that adjustments a year to 18 months prior to the games would not have a huge impact
4064255 unfortunately thats the cost of doing business in a high performance sport these days
4064256 all we do is train that means as an athlete if we want to compete on the world stage we cant be working
4064257 up to now it has often been a challenge for check in personnel and passengers to keep current about what documents are needed for travelling abroad
4064258 with state of the art technology now evaluating the passenger s travel documents and deciding if the passenger is allowed to travel auto doc check is taking the guess work out this decision
4064259 once a passenger indicates the documents he plans to carry with him auto doc check immediately lets him know if he has sufficient and valid documents or not

4064265 this is another symbol of olympus commitment to quality i am pleased that eqa recognizes that quality innovation and sound management are not incompatible whether it is the olympus proprietary cost containment paradigm or its exclusive affiliation with inroommds physician controlled gatekeeper tm product olympus continues to outshine its competition by electronically managing transactions between the payer provider and patient we take enormous care to provide superior quality that not just meets but consistently exceeds expectations this certification underscores that our mission of superior quality is measurable and worthy of the global recognition it represents
4064266 the greatest benefit of this recognition is the confidence it instills in our clients and our staff knowing that we are accountable for our quality processes and that we pledge to continue to develop processes that will deliver superior quality in the future
4064267 the customer insight portal is a game changer for the way companies seek to understand their customer attitudes and behaviors
4064268 it allows virtually any organization or individual user to easily gain insight into the root causes of customer opinion and feedback our state of the art market intelligence software has been proven on the desktop world wide and now we are making it available through the customer insight portal
4064269 the customer insight portal lets business people explore and automatically find meaning and identifies structured relationships between the key ideas or issues that are important to customers uncovering information that was previously hidden
4064270 from the people that have already used the portal theyre saying that it provides previously unknown actionable insights which is great validation of whats possible
4064271 with eight offices nationwide and 1 500 attorneys and staff we are focused on cost effective ways to reduce our energy consumption and environmental impact
4064272 in addition we count as clients in our clean technology practice some of the leading entrepreneurs and investors in the world who have further inspired all of us at cooley to do our part
4064273 many companies are going green these days and it is no longer based strictly on the financial benefits it may be based on environmental concerns financial stability or to be good stewards of the environment and ensure a positive impact in the community it is a pleasure to be involved in an industry where we work with forward thinking and progressive individuals who want to do good by doing right
4064274 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4064275 the plan behind this project is to fill the gap between the little we do know about bluefin behavior in the mediterranean and what we need to know
4064276 when we have better data we would urge fisheries decision makers to use it to make better informed choices for the management of this endangered species
4064277 bluefin tuna stocks are on the brink of collapsing which would be catastrophic not only for the species but for everyone who depends on these fish for their livelihoods and survival
4064278 this project will help arm us with the information we need to fuel our work to restore tuna populations to healthy levels

4064283 while we expect revenue growth of approximately 25 percent in 2009 growth will be driven primarily by our distribution segment and although we expect tepid revenue growth in our commercial aircraft and business jet groups in 2009 we expect strong earnings growth in both groups driven by margin expansion in addition we expect double digit revenue growth in both the commercial aircraft and business jet groups in 2010
4064284 the current robust rfp activity and our developing positions on the b787 b747 8 a350 xwb and a380 support our expectation of continued backlog growth in 2009 and 2010 double digit revenue growth in 2010 and continued revenue growth thereafter
4064285 mark is a great fit for our team and brings valuable leadership experience to a strong engineering team
4064286 the addition of a seasoned leader like mark and the expansion of our field presence in silicon valley validates tesedas new direction and is indicative of its continued growth in the silicon debug and yield improvement markets
4064287 dna vaccines offer a promising avenue of pursuit in aids vaccine development

4064325 one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
4064326 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
4064327 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
4064328 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
4064329 our concern was that it creates tremendous confusion for people to get one notice and then another

4064332 cuts in programs would have to be considerably above 1 billion to meet patersons state savings figure
4064333 we have got to stop this frenzy about spending and lack of accountability
4064334 we need from the legislature real and reoccurring cuts we need a sense of understanding of how serious this problem can get
4064335 this report shows us that there are still hurdles that keep all americans from getting the best health care available regardless of which agencies help them get it

4064379 kevin tiene un gran coraz n pero no estoy de acuerdo con la decisi n de darle m s dinero
4064380 i would hope it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at that time where britney is at that time
4064381 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

4064394 tying the hands of councils leaving them unable to respond to the legitimate concerns of local people
4064395 would appear to remove access to any remedy for local health or environmental impacts caused by dust smoke odour noise or light
4064396 it is totally unacceptable that people should not be able to complain about noise light pollution and general disturbances to their day to day lives
4064397 councils need to be able to hold construction companies to account to ensure that disruption for local people is kept to an absolute minimum
4064398 the planning bill will ensure that anyone who suffers nuisance will be able to seek compensation which is a quicker and more reliable route than the uncertainty of a nuisance claim which can be misused by lawyers trying to block development by simply firing off injunctions causing unnecessary delay to decisions

4064403 when abhinav fired the first shot in the sighting time it hit the target between the fourth and fifth rings

4064429 establishing local representation will enable us to provide increased support to our customers grow our customer base and ensure successful digital television launches across india
4064430 i fail to understand why the government is dithering on issuing clear guidelines to allay the apprehensions of broadcasters the broadcasters today apprehend that in view of the existing guidelines if they provide signals or content to the hits platform they will be violating the existing guidelines because the existing guidelines permit supply of signals or content only to registered msos and cable operators and to the dth platform it is high time that the government immediately takes a decision on this aspect in consumer interest we all talk of consumer interest and say that consumer interest comes first but this has remained a mere slogan in reality nobody appears to be bothered about consumer interest
4064431 though the broadcast tribunal had dismissed our petition at the same time it has criticised the government for not clearing the hits policy we would now send the copy of the judgment to the ministry of information and broadcasting so that the matter could be resolved as soon as possible because in the hits case the policy is the only major issue and once this gets sorted i am sure we will witness a faster roll out of hits
4064432 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4064433 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4064434 chinas authoritarian government and the ioc repeatedly have said the games would open the country to social change and stoke breakthroughs on religious freedom and the treatment of the countrys minorities
4064435 of course there are exceptions like in any other country
4064436 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details
4064437 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4064438 i did not say that china will promise to do whatever with the games coming to china

4064467 to create a sustainable it industry we need to reduce the use of raw materials by 50 and soon

4064482 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4064483 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4064484 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4064485 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4064486 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4064510 god knows who all the negotiating parties consult we can only speculate
4064511 but they could be approaching the military and saying to them look this is what we are talking about what do you think and that could mean there is still a long walk towards breaking the deadlock
4064512 in any democratic country the role of the military is to protect the state and the citizens but we have here men in the higher echelons of the military that have been politicised and publicly aligned themselves to mugabe

4064585 we chose these conditions because they are underfunded involve daily pain and have personal meaning for us
4064586 we saw the suffering of our close family and friends with these chronic conditions and we wanted to do something to help
4064587 we may expand to other conditions if enough patients come together to request it
4064588 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4064589 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
4064590 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
4064591 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4064592 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4064593 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4064594 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
4064595 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4064596 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4064597 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4064598 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4064599 the longer the court delays in enforcing the settlement between the parties the more like the value of the consideration subject of the settlement will change
4064600 any further delay in enforcing the settlement will create a serious risk of prejudice to facebook as well as to connectu
4064601 this means the status quo cannot be preserved with a stay
4064602 one hundred and twenty five thousand people were living and working at these three sites
4064603 when youre in the building or in the control room youre two or three degrees of separation from einstein or enrico fermi
4064604 the atomic bomb was an event that changed the course of world history and the world we live in today
4064605 the militants believe that the shiite officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
4064606 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking the import of goods from iran
4064607 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shiites especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
4064608 if the us launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the us
4064609 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
4064610 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
4064611 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
4064612 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
4064613 the iraqi government gives us 5 million per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
4064614 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
4064615 that influence favors only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
4064616 the badr militia and all their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the american tanks
4064617 until the americans came there was no way they badr and iranian backed politicians and religious leaders could set one foot in this country
4064618 as he needs to consider the public opinion and his popularity bloomberg reported hana daetoo securities kim jae eun as saying the government plans to hold public hearings to discuss further details of the sales and submit a bill to the national assembly in september bloomberg said
4064619 it is inappropriate for foreign investors to take over daewoo shipbuilding
4064620 while it appears that only minor ones few koreans ever heard of are included
4064621 misses the key objective of boosting koreas economic efficiency by streamlining the bloated structure of state run companies
4064622 since the beginning of this year we have seen the deployment of some new tactics by insurgents
4064623 they are no longer targeting civilians by planting bombs on buses as they did in the 1990s but attacking government personnel army and the police this is aimed at winning the general population on their side
4064624 chinas success in fighting those terrorists at home has made it impossible for them to survive underground and many are now training abroad
4064625 in 2001 it may have been premature to say that the east turkestan islamic movement was part of the global jihad but by now many of its elements have spent so much time in the tribal border areas of pakistan that we cant really say for sure what cause they stand for
4064626 they are trying to show that their actions are aimed at whom they view as their main opponent the chinese government
4064627 excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
4064628 resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people
4064629 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
4064630 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
4064631 told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program
4064632 the going in assumption was that we were going to war so this nie was to be written with that in mind
4064633 reported that production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place
4064634 gave those of us at the most senior level further confidence that our information about saddams wmd programs was correct
4064635 we should not see this handover as a loss for nigeria or as a sign of weakness but our profound respect for international law and good neighbourliness
4064636 this handing over process as painful as it is for everyone including the president is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
4064637 around two thirds of the increase in the standard inequality gauge is offset by the poors lower inflation rate
4064638 the range of goods consumed by poor households increased by far more than for rich households the benefit of this extra variety is not captured in income or inflation but it can be quantified
4064639 shut up you guys this is going to be good
4064640 if that gain is expressed as an addition to real income the remaining increase in inequality vanishes
4064641 soaring prices of imports including petroleum lowers the gdp deflator
4064642 truly orwellian logic higher import prices mean lower inflation and therefore higher growth
4064643 doesnt mind admitting that technical analysis is pretty useless in the face of this kind of intervention
4064644 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy us government debt instruments so that they can earn interest on their money the debt instruments central banks acquire are held in custody for them at the federal reserve which reports this amount weekly
4064645 gold closed just above the 850 support line during a washout caused by the performance of a us dollar that defies belief without any improvement in fundamentals the dollar rose 132 points today the largest gain in years despite a banking crisis low interest rates huge deficits money supply running in double digits housing sector in shambles the us dollar has now risen eight out of the last nine days someone please convince me that this is not rigged meanwhile at 855 the gold price is back at 323 expressed in 1980 dollars

4064651 poor russian president dmitry medvedev was one of the collateral victims of the war
4064652 who will say and when whether what began in south ossetia at the weekend is a passing crisis or on the contrary a gravely worrying prospect
4064653 it is perfectly normal that russia wants to defend its own interests and the interests of russians inside russia as well as russian speakers outside russia

4064674 how and when should we teach our children about sex
4064675 this is not about teaching four year olds how to have sex but teaching them about respecting themselves and others and giving them the confidence to ask questions when they get older and do want to find out more its like maths at primary school children learn the basics so that they can understand more and more complex concepts at a later stage

4064679 or how should we present our case if a turk were to ask us to give reasons for our faith he doesnt care how long we have believed a certain way or how many or how eminent the people are who have believed this or that we would have to be silent about all these things and direct him to the holy scriptures as the basis for our faith it would be absurd and ridiculous if we were to say look here so many priests bishops kings princes lands and peoples have believed this and that ever so long
4064680 in my opinion the free will could have been so defined as to avoid overconfidence in our merits and the other disadvantages which luther shuns as well as to avoid such as we recited above and still not lose the advantages which luther admires this it seems to me is accomplished by those who attribute everything to the pulling by grace which is the first to excite our spirit and attribute only something to human will in its effort to continue and not withdraw from divine grace but since all things have three parts a beginning a continuation and an end grace is attributed to the two extremities and only in continuation does the free will effect something
4064681 when reading the confession ac we must not ignore the historical circumstance that the ac presents itself as a statement that soberly but self consciously relates what is being proclaimed in the confessors congregations how these congregations have been ordered and which abuses have been abolished otherwise a free floating autonomy is imposed upon it which it never claims for itself the ac does not intend to initiate anything it does not intend to create any new church doctrine rather its purpose is simply to reproduce what is taught in the christian church its entire design is alien to any sense of what we have come to understand as confessionalism thus it is not without irony that with the formation of the smalcald league 1531 the ac became the symbol of unity for a special group of princes and cities and later as confessionalism spread throughout europe e g with the peace of augsburg 1555 became the distinctive symbol of the so called lutheran church
4064682 when one deals with words and promises one needs faith even between men here on earth no business or community could last very long if no one were prepared to trust anothers word or signature now as we can plainly see god deals with us in no other way than by his holy word and sacraments which are like signs or seals of his words the very first thing necessary then is faith in these words and signs for when god speaks and gives signs man must firmly and wholeheartedly believe that what he says and signifies is true so that we do not consider him a liar or juggler but trust him to be faithful and true this faith pleases god above all things and does him the highest honor because it believes him to be true and a righteous god therefore he in turn considers this faith as godliness good and sufficient unto salvation
4064683 i admit that many passages in scriptures are obscure and abstruse
4064684 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years

4064711 i know my job and that is to keep the best players from last season find the best players to add to the squad
4064712 im working hard trying to be ready when we have the chance to bring in the best players
4064713 but the market could change at any time and you have to be ready to take that opportunity to get the better players
4064714 some players could go while some others could come you have to be ready at any time
4064715 my plan to build our organisation by finding the best european and south american players from around the world we need time
4064716 the balance should be looked at at the end of the market and the real balance will be shown at the end of the season

4064735 recreation is growing but the fields are small we have soccer football and cheerleading but want to add basketball
4064736 we cant just jump into what a few people want when we have to consider how to include everyone young and old

4064745 exotic locations gave great scope to authors to be a bit racier it is usually an english person going into the tropics to experience this different culture
4064746 but they never lose their moral foundation the heroines normally wind up reforming the sheikh
4064747 this was not england but the tropics where blood was hotter and where incredible things happen with amazing swiftness
4064748 with horizons being broadened and more international travel the romances set in rose covered cottages did not have the same cache as greece ibiza and south africa
4064749 the alpha male has to be larger than life an incredibly heroic figure he was usually fabulously wealthy with a mystery about him
4064750 as the world has become more globalised our settings have had to become more exotic more luxurious and exciting where our heroes were once millionaires now they have to be billionaires
4064751 we are also looking at the indian prince idea he is a clear extension of the alpha male and we are looking at launching this next year

4064755 raid pdi headquarters that simple command issued by president soeharto to his security forces in july 1996 triggered the extraordinary political power struggle that would consume indonesian for years to come
4064756 after several years and after the loss of thousands of lives the forces of change would triumph and indonesia would become the worlds third largest democracy or at least so it would appear in fact appearances can be misleading in indonesia and triumphs can prove ephemeral
4064757 with ctf s final report the human rights violation case before and after the 1999 referendum is closed and would not be brought to legal process
4064758 its obvious that they want to use this as evidence for the guernsey court to continue extending a freeze on a bnp paribas account belonging to my client

4064761 what can i do to not make this same mistake with my business
4064762 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
4064763 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
4064764 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
4064765 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
4064766 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
4064767 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of
4064768 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
4064769 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half

4064773 establishing the most effective combinations of drug treatments and the timings in which they are given is an important area of clinical research
4064774 but the benefits of giving zoledronic acid after doxorubicin have only been shown here in mice
4064775 they will now need to be evaluated more fully in people with breast cancer before we know if this will be an effective treatment option for women with the disease in northern ireland
4064776 these results suggest that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
4064777 we eagerly look forward to the results of a large breast cancer trial later this year to confirm our findings this method of treatment could then quickly be incorporated into clinical practice

4064779 for two years i have carried two passports but today i was a georgian just that
4064780 today we went out with only one idea it was to stay in these olympics to keep everybodys dream of winning a medal for our country alive yes im glad we are still in and the russians are out
4064781 i should say that the competition has been outstanding and our opponents have made big progress in the last half year our olympics are over because we have lost a game today and we regret it but i have to say we were not playing against the georgian team we were playing against brazilians they probably dont know the name of the president of georgia
4064782 russia is big georgia is small to me it is stupid for georgia to start a war against us i am a volleyball player i do not understand anything about war
4064783 of course i know the name of mikhail saakashvili he signed my passport i also know his wife i met her in the olympic village a few days ago she used to play volleyball and she is delighted that we are developing the game in georgia i want to take some young georgian players to brazil where it is better for practice i have a purpose now
4064784 i know what kind of people i am playing for they are fighters who do not give up easily
4064785 the world may see this as a small win but sometimes a small win can be great there are many difficulties and uncertainties facing us all but this is the feeling i have at this moment
4064786 todays team was formed because we have good contacts in brazil coaches who have helped us and who we hope will help us again in the future
4064787 although the russians were bad losers i do wish them success in the future however from our position we do have a message for everyone if you are going to make war it is better to do it on the field i say that with some feeling because i have had just a few hours sleep since the start of the war
4064788 we have a duty to georgia they have given us the olympics we were not such good players in brazil but we have grown here in brazil there are so many good players they could make up eight or nine teams to compete at this level so you have to remember what people have given to you and i do know that when the team were up in the night and wondering what to do i thought well if they go back what do i do i do not have a home in georgia but then i thought i have to go back there im part of these people now i am more georgian now we know now that it was probably good that we stayed because we would have been flying back to many dangers we heard that the airport had been bombed
4064789 we wanted chloe to be a symbol of hope and i think that is how she is remembered
4064790 she is a normal girl she loves going out and playing with her friends but well always remember just how lucky she was
4064791 chloe survived and that was a very happy time for us but for many other families it was a very sad time i know people who died at omagh and i just hope and pray that those days never come back again
4064792 when the bomb went off the first thing i thought about was my baby
4064793 i was just a few hundred yards from the bomb and there were people around me who died
4064794 i had been due to go into hospital on the monday the doctors later said she was so lucky chloe shouldnt have survived the blast i was just so relieved to have her safely in my arms
4064795 in the weeks after giving birth i got hundreds of cards and presents from people all over the world
4064796 some people wrote and suggested names a few times hope came up and i thought that was so fitting it summed up how we felt at the time chloe would bring hope to the future it did give people a sense of happiness so many people wrote to me afterwards and said how good had come out of something so terrible
4064797 that poor woman was carrying twins and they all died as a new mum i realised just how sad that was
4064798 at the time i think we showed that it can work
4064799 there was a lot of division back then but things have changed
4064800 chloe doesnt really understand any of that now its very different to my experience of growing up
4064801 chloe has seen the scrapbook which we kept and she knows that we were in omagh that day i think she knows we were all very lucky but its something that will maybe only sink in properly when she gets a bit bigger
4064802 we have been to a few of the anniversary services and well go to the one on friday its going to be a very sad occasion
4064803 i wanted a world record i wanted a 1min 51seconds or better but under the circumstances its not a bad result

4064805 do what you love and youll never have to work a day in your whole life
4064806 does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick out handle
4064807 its a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with but really loves you then you become real
4064808 does it happen all at once like being wound up
4064809 you become it takes a long time thats why it doesnt happen often to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand

4064874 through it according to this view we can retrace the path from civilized man who lives so far from nature to man who lived in close companionship with nature and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth with trees and seas and flowers and hills unlike anything we ourselves can feel when the stories were being shaped we were given to understand little distinction had yet been made between the real and the unreal the imagination was vividly alive and not checked by reason so that anyone in the woods might see through the trees a fleeing nymph or bending over a clear pool to drink behold in the depths a naiads face

4064919 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4064920 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4064921 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4065006 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4065007 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4065008 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4065009 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4065032 wir haben uns darauf eingestellt dass die finanzwirtschaft unter druck bleibt

4065034 i had never captained my country until tuesdays game against bulgaria so i was delighted when sean mccaffrey told me
4065035 it was a good performance by us against bulgaria we were comfortable in the first half they pressed us for a while after half time but we finished the game strongly and were worthy winners
4065036 all of the lads are pushing for places in the squad some new lads who werent with us last season at under 16 level have come in and done well competition is good it keeps everyone on their toes

4065039 russische soldaten werden noch zwei tage in der region bleiben um die kontrolle an georgische beh rden zu bergeben
4065040 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam
4065041 dass alle russischen truppen die in den vergangenen tagen nach georgien marschiert sind das land wieder verlassen
4065042 wir haben berhaupt nichts gegen zus tzliche beobachter in s dossetien
4065043 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4065044 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4065045 the fans were great right from my first home game at the kc stadium
4065046 they were fantastic right through to the play off final at wembley and hopefully ill get a good reception going back there im really grateful to the fans at hull for the way they treated me
4065047 it was history for hull city and everything about it was great i really enjoyed myself down there last season
4065048 when you go on loan you dont know what to expect but it was a dream loan move and it turned out great
4065049 it was great to get some recognition for what i was doing at the time
4065050 i wasnt really thinking about the under 21s but it was an aim in the back of my mind and it was fantastic to get on the pitch for england and show what im about
4065051 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry wales said today at the global brand forum in singapore
4065052 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4065053 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4065054 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes said wales
4065055 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4065056 can participate in meaningful ways when they browse the internet he said
4065057 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways wales said
4065058 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians he said
4065059 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4065060 as georgians come under attack we must ask if the west is not with us who is it with if the line is not drawn now when will it be drawn
4065061 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st century system of security
4065062 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere
4065063 russia intends to destroy not just a country but an idea
4065064 i looked back and could see the second carriage on an angle after i stopped i didnt realise the full extent i knew the truck hit me mr lidster said in his witness statement
4065065 i went towards the rear of the train a bloke come towards me he informed me the people in the third carriage were dead
4065066 all of a sudden i saw the truck hit everything just went everywhere
4065067 the front of the truck flew up into the air then i saw the carriage of the train coming past opened up like a tin
4065068 he was trying his hardest to get off the road he told the court

4065078 the name is very important and it is also important that whatever name is chosen reflects the fact it is a new council
4065079 i wouldnt want to see it as ipswich and felixstowe council
4065080 i would like to think it could be something innovative like orwell unitary but we are open to suggestions
4065081 this new council will be about involving everybody so lets start with the name
4065082 i think orwell relates to something more than haven does
4065083 if you call it orwell or even east suffolk at least you can relate to it
4065084 i dont like north haven it doesnt mean anything to me
4065085 i havent got a clue what it should be called im not sure if its a good idea anyway
4065086 orwell sounds quite good because the river goes a long way and takes in ipswich and felixstowe
4065087 as far as im concerned they should leave it well alone if it aint broke dont alter it

4065096 how can public broadcasting stations can leverage social networks to increase engagement and build audience

4065103 i am disgusted by this theft red house is an extra special building
4065104 it has been left in a position where it is vulnerable and able to be vandalised
4065105 the council plans to dispose of this building but they have not said to whom it will go it is the only council owned building in great barr which could be used for community purposes in an area where we have a lack of facilities
4065106 we are actively looking into the future of red house

4065110 it was the first time i had tried it but i had a good few goes because i really enjoyed it
4065111 i got an email saying i was a record breaker and i genuinely thought it was a wind up
4065112 the official records are kept in america so the whole thing sounded even more far fetched and i couldnt stop laughing
4065113 i was very sporting in my younger days and i used to throw the discus at school but i had never thrown a frisbee
4065114 i was certainly not dressed for it i was wearing my ceremonial chain for a start which was a bit of a hindrance
4065115 but ive told the organisers ill be back next year and that ill beat my record so i might have to have a sly practice in the mean time

4065144 i knew that it was gonna make a splash but i didnt know that it was going to be such a huge cannonball

4065148 katherine is incredibly talented and were grateful for her work in creating army wives we are very happy to have had the opportunity to work with her
4065149 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4065150 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year people in india were burning effigies of her in the street
4065151 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone that shes not a racist

4065160 diese krise zeigt ganz klar dass das sicherheitsvakuum das im postsowjetischen raum existiert weiterhin gef hrlich ist da die ukraine nach russland das gr sste land in der region ist und eine lange grenze mit der europ ischen gemeinschaft aufweist bleibt sie in diesem vakuum gef hrdet

4065173 the purpose of this brief questionnaire is to allow candidates to conveniently and publicly indicate and explain their positions on these important national issues candidanswers is the only online voter guide that enables voters to directly ask candidates questions on the environment
4065174 right now only 9 percent of the total u s work trips employ mass transit compared to 40 percent in europe transportation accounts for two thirds of u s oil consumption and is the main contributor to global warming pollution americans that commute via train or bus reduce their carbon footprint significantly and save themselves money in the process

4065176 if the fsa adopted limits on speculation you would see the price of gasoline drop in the united kingdom

4065180 the majority of our b s students will come from our current a a s students who are looking for the opportunity to continue their education
4065181 employers in the field want employees with a bachelors degree thats more and more the trend
4065182 mara mooney essentially wrote the entire proposal for the usg it was reviewed by myself and associate dean dr benita moore but mara deserves the lions share of the credit
4065183 we re mapped the curriculum for all of our programs they bear almost no similarity to the old curriculum however the bachelors is an extension of what were already doing in the certificate and associates programs
4065184 were really pleased that the general education courses contain a lot of english and history a lot of sophisticated writing and reading communications skills at the highest possible level are needed the degree serves a purpose and the requirements arent easy the students who take the program will earn their degree and theyll be very well prepared
4065185 we are proud to add this new degree to our existing array of certificate associate bachelor and graduate degrees that provide professional education and training for the region
4065186 most of our certificate students are able to attend practically for free if someone already has his her degree the certificate program is an ideal option

4065200 politically whites will be much more interested in issues like health care and pensions
4065201 at the same time the growing minority population hispanics especially will be concerned about more youthful issues like schools
4065202 what this population rise means to me is anywhere from 40 to 80 million more cars on the road 35 to 40 million more houses built

4065208 im sure we could obtain oil on the free market without having to occupy countries like iraq and afghanistan so why do we have to create an empire and colonize half the world for oil

4065232 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4065233 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4065234 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4065247 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
4065248 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4065249 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
4065250 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
4065251 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
4065252 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
4065253 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering

4065278 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
4065279 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
4065280 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
4065281 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know

4065324 the idea that i want this thing right now and i can get it but the experience is fleeting and then there is this debt that is there until it is paid off
4065325 the first step is realizing you have some issues going on and that you need to do something about it

4065336 i certainly would offer best military advice that we should engage the russians not to pursue that approach

4065355 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4065356 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4065549 do you have any idea what percentage of non grocery domestic sales comes from overseas
4065550 what we dont know is the numbers of products that come from distributors or from manufacturers that they sic decide where to manufacture
4065551 we source production of substantially all of our toy products and certain of our game products through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china
4065552 the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china

4065556 extensive violations of child labor laws and state regulations requiring time for breaks and meals
4065557 only 5 percent of the containers passing through our ports are scanned
4065558 all it takes is one atomic or radiological bomb to make 9 11 look like a firecracker and to bring commerce to a total halt for weeks or months while every ship is searched by hand because we dont have in place the means to scan every container that is what this motion to mandate 100 scanning is about if we really want to make this country safer we must demand that before any container is put on a ship bound for the united states it must be scanned electronically in the foreign port
4065559 now why is 100 percent scanning of cargo important it is important because of all of the unsecured nuclear material in the former soviet union that al qaeda can purchase take to a port in europe in asia in africa and then with a piece of paper and an id waive on a 10 000 or 20 000 or 30 000 pound container and with the nuclear bomb inside of it send that ship that container right to a port in the united states to new york to boston to california to any other city in america without being screened
4065560 my nightmare mr chairman has been ever since 9 11 that somebody somehow smuggles a nuclear weapon into one of our cities not just a dirty bomb but a real nuclear weapon its worth a little extra effort and a few extra dollars to make sure that doesnt happen

4065563 wal mart resists efforts in congress to dramatically tighten port security in wake of dubai ports furor the company argues examining all containers or even a fixed percentage of them could impede shipping and boost costs
4065564 wal mart and other big businesses have been lobbying against 100 percent scanning alleging that it will slow their massive import operations
4065565 m ove cautiously and with careful deliberation before considering any new legislation related to the security of our nations seaports or commercial cargo congress should be careful to avoid measures that would harm global supply chain efficiency or unnecessarily delay the movement of food and cargo
4065566 continued industry leadership in opposition to ill advised and onerous port security measures i e cargo fees increased physical inspections
4065567 we are the industry driving the u s economy any increased delays or costs would really impact
4065568 the total cost of third party compliance inspections deploying smart containers and operating a cargo scanning system such as the one being piloted in hong kong 100 percent scanning likely reach 50 to 100 per container depending on the number of containers an importer has and the complexity of its supply chain can industry afford the cost of this regime even if the final price tag came in at 100 additional cost per container it would raise the average price of cargo moved by wal mart or target by only 2 percent congressional quarterly march 28 2006 wal mart uses money and influence to pressure politicians to oppose strengthing port security and rilas recent investments in members of congress with power over port and supply chain security issues are massive and tilt heavily to republicans as of 2006 wal mart had given 191 500 to current house homeland security committee members since 2000 all but 9 500 of that since the september 2001 attacks afl cio unchecked how wal mart uses its might to block port security

4065659 administration means the firm has spent more than has come in and a lot of this has been on the loan options brand which it appears merchant business finance will reap the benefits of
4065660 my concern shared by others in the broker community is that smaller introducers and ifas looking for a solid partner will contact loan options thinking it is the same company that won awards and plaudits in its dramatic growth in the past
4065661 the new investment we have attracted means that merchant business finance through loan options is probably the best placed loans packager to see out the wider economic downturn we are all facing introducers will i am sure want to continue to do business with us because we have not let them down

4065664 dont do it just start exercising and practising portion control the grapefruit diet is a scam as soon as you start eating normally if small portions youll put all your weight back on possibly more because your body will be in starvation mode
4065665 my uncle did that and it worked great on him but he did look a bit
4065666 first of all grapefruit i heard promotes the metabolism second eating all the meat you want and only that will make any one lose wait because the more protein you take in the harder you body works to process it protein is the hardest substance to process so therefore your body burns calories trying to digest it and protein usually doesnt carry with it very many bad calories
4065667 it is just a gimmick and a scam stay far far away from this
4065668 i have been doing somewhat of a grapefruit diet for about a month now and have lost about 10 lbs i have been doing some cardio as well though so i cant exactly say how much is totally contributed by the actual fruit
4065669 its not the eating of the grapefruit that helps you lose weight rather the healthy or actually not very healthy eating plan that goes with it that sheds the pounds if you near starve yourself for a week using any wonder food as the gimmick you will lose some weight

4065675 that was not acceptable to the georgians who left the discussion
4065676 after they left they sent down a team of georrgian special forces soldiers to discuss with tjhe russians access to the town
4065677 at that point the russians fearing some sort of assault was under way moved their tanks from the centre of town to the edge of the town

4065706 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4065707 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4065710 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4065711 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4065712 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4065713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4065714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4065715 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4065716 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4065797 shes happy enough in herself and shes such a brave girl and shell talk about her cancer saying i know ill get better ill know ill get through this and ill fight it but her whole life has changed
4065798 it would be just her dream come true if she could go to disneyland paris it would be a break for her from everything she been having to go through
4065799 fully satisfied and assured that god was able and mighty to keep his word and to do what he had promised

4065812 i am devastated i want to warn people to watch out for this scam i bought the tickets in good faith and then in the week of the concert they go bust its very fishy
4065813 it was a nightmare we ordered them when the first went on sale from summerfestivaltickets com and paid straight away but now four days before the event we are told they have gone bust
4065814 were aware that unofficial outlets claim to have had v festival tickets for sale but as concert promoters we urge the public not to get tickets from these
4065815 for this is the abundant grace of the new testament and the surpassing mercy of the heavenly father that through baptism and repentance we begin to become godly and pure
4065816 quando falo em estados unidos qual a primeira coisa que surge em sua mente
4065817 os mosteiros beneditinos haviam praticamente deixado de serem institui es espirituais passaram a ser centros acad micos med ocres reservados em sua imensa maioria para membros da elite
4065818 n o considero poss vel dada a natureza das coisas que qualquer reavivamento ou religi o dure muito a religi o precisa necessariamente produzir trabalho e sobriedade e os dois combinados s podem resultar em riqueza por m medida que a riqueza cresce crescem tamb m orgulho ira e amor ao mundo em todos os seus aspectos
4065819 that is also the meaning of christs saying in the last chapter of mark 16 16
4065820 similarly we too are not entirely cured by baptism or repentance but a beginning is made in us and the bandage of the first grace binds our wounds so that our healing may proceed from day to day until we are cured the new leaven is the faith and grace of the spirit it does not leaven the whole lump at once but gently and gradually we become like this new leaven and eventually a bread of god this life therefore is not godliness but the process of becoming godly not health but getting well not being but becoming not rest but exercise we are not now what we shall be but we are on the way the process is not yet finished but it is actively going on this is not the goal but it is the right road at present everything does not gleam and sparkle but everything is being cleansed

4065822 the farther west one goes on the cape the more rain they have seen this summer
4065823 well the seemingly daily episodes of afternoon and evening thunderstorms that have fired up over interior new england feed off of instability caused by heat and humidity and contrasts in air masses both horizontally and vertically
4065824 the air on cape cod due to the cool marine layer that surrounds the peninsula is typically far more stable than that seen over interior southern new england
4065825 consequently as thunderstorms push eastward in the prevailing winds they lose their energy source the contrast in temperatures as they approach the cape more often than not resulting in a weakening trend

4065832 die politik darf die alarmsignale nicht mehr ignorieren sterreich braucht sofortma nahmen zur ankurbelung des konsums und damit der gesamten wirtschaft vor allem die menschen mit niedrigen einkommen brauchen effiziente entlastungsma nahmen wie etwa eine steuerreform die so schnell wie m glich umgesetzt wird
4065833 auch hier sind sofortma nahmen gefragt das sozialpartnerpaket f r ltere arbeitnehmerinnen muss endlich umgesetzt werden und die schutzfristen f r den heimischen arbeitsmarkt m ssen bis 2011 genutzt werden
4065834 ein hauptgrund f r den konjunktureinbruch ist die stotternde konsumnachfrage der private inlandskonsum w chst deutlich langsamer als die wirtschaft und wirkt daher d mpfend es ist aber kein wunder dass die menschen nicht gerade in shoppinglaune kommen wenn ihre einkommen real sinken und alles vor allem energie und lebensmittel immer teurer werden
4065835 noch bevor die schwache konjunktur auf die arbeitspl tze durchschl gt m ssen die parlamentsparteien reagieren
4065836 das paket k nnte l ngst schon in kraft sein rechtzeitig vor dem prognostizierten einbrechen der konjunktur

4065838 w hrend die vp im rahmen eines sonderlandtages f r die abschaffung der von der sp wien automatisierten geb hrenlawine dem valorisierungsgesetz k mpft versucht pr sident tumpel mit dem wiederk uen alter h te auf bundesebene das sommerloch zu bertauchen
4065839 der pr sident muss t tig werden und die sp stadtregierung die die wienerinnen und wiener vor den augen der ak kritiklos abzockt zur ordnung rufen
4065840 die ak spitze muss an jene sp gemeinder te die in der arbeiterkammer hohe funktionen bekleiden einwirken und daf r sorge tragen dass gemeinsam mit der wiener vp das valorisierungsgesetz abgeschafft wird
4065841 das ist der einzig m gliche schritt um den wienerinnen und wiener eine weitere geb hrenlawine zu beginn des kommenden jahres zu ersparen
4065842 von blumigen worten begleitet hat sozialminister buchinger heute zwei studien vorgestellt die er aus wahltaktischen gr nden monatelang unter verschluss gehalten hat
4065843 zum ersten zeigen die ergebnisse der studien nicht wie sehr hersteller an gt
4065844 das verbot von crocs schuhen in den wiener spit lern ist alleine keine ausreichende ma nahme zum schutz der patientinnen
4065845 solange die mitarbeiterinnen im dienst privat erworbene schuhe tragen m ssen besteht das risiko durch statische entladungen weiterhin
4065846 eine einzelne schuhmarke zu verbieten wird nicht die gew nschte sicherheit bringen
4065847 obwohl ein solcher fall bisher noch nicht eingetreten ist nehmen wir die warnung der fachleute ernst schlie lich ist es erfreulich wenn nicht erst etwas passieren muss damit ein risiko ausgeschlossen wird
4065848 wir schlagen daher nachdr cklich vor dass seitens des dienstgebers in allen sensiblen arbeitsbereichen geeignete schuhe zur verf gung gestellt werden die die notwendigen sicherheitsbestimmungen erf llen damit k nnte die sicherheit f r patienten fl chendeckend garantiert werden
4065849 ein verpflichtendes kindergartenjahr f r f nfj hrige soll eine bereicherung der kindheit sein keine belastung mit p dagogisch ad quaten formen sollen die kinder spielerisch lernen
4065850 die begabungen der kinder rechtzeitig f rdern und etwaige defizite so fr h als m glich ausgleichen
4065851 nun wollen nicht nur sp und vp die b rgerinnen f r dumm verkaufen auch j rg haider gesellt sich dazu die nominierung eines spitzenkandidaten f r die nationalratswahl der gar nicht in den nationalrat wechseln will ist eine neue episode im blau orangen kabarettprogramm
4065852 die sozialdemokratie l sst sich von der kronen zeitung bernehmen die vp will ihre eigenen forderungen nicht umsetzen die fp geb rdet sich wie eh und je und das bz will den b rgerinnen weismachen bei einer nationalratswahl w rde der k rntner landtag gew hlt werden
4065853 die haider kandidatur ist eine plumpe mogelpackung eine pflanzerei der w hlerinnen die gr nen sind offenbar die einzige stimme der vernunft und des neubeginns in dieser republik die brigen parteien missbrauchen das politische system nur mehr f r die interessen ihrer funktion re und ihrer spitzen
4065854 letztlich entscheidet prim r der preis die wahl des installateurs installateure die auf qualit t setzen haben keine m glichkeit diese dem kunden darzustellen und sich damit am markt zu differenzieren um hier mehr sicherheit und transparenz f r beide seiten zu schaffen entwickelt die sterreichische energieagentur qualit tskriterien f r heizungsinstallationen
4065855 davon profitieren nicht nur die kunden sondern auch die installateure die den wert ihrer arbeit sichtbar machen
4065856 als das f r die antidiskriminierung im land nieder sterreich zust ndige regierungsmitglied ist es f r mich v llig unverst ndlich und auch nicht akzeptabel dass in der heutigen zeit eine ablehnung eines freiwilligen engagement bzw der aufnahme in einen verein nur mit der begr ndung des geschlechts was eindeutig eine diskriminierung ohne sachliche rechtfertigung bedeuten w rde ausschlaggebender grund sein kann der j ngste fall der freiwilligen feuerwehr brunn gebirge ist f r mich ein unr hmliches und nicht akzeptables beispiel und ich bin mir auch sicher dass dies auch bei tausenden feuerwehrkameradinnen und kameraden ebenso auf unverst ndnis st t
4065857 das gesamte feuerwehrwesen beruht auf der arbeit und mitwirkung freiwilliger helferinnen und es ist sehr begr enswert wenn junge menschen bereit sind ihre freizeit in den dienst der allgemeinheit zu stellen ich hoffe daher dass es sich im konkreten fall um ein missverst ndnis handelt welches rasch bereinigt wird
4065858 bis dato hat die kritik der bundeswettbewerbsbeh rde wenig wirkung auf die mineral lfirmen

4065860 dass der absolutwert in deutschland h her ist als in sterreich liegt an der unterschiedlichen besteuerung und nicht am produktpreis interessant ist die gegens tzliche produktpreisentwicklung obwohl die preise in deutschland angeblich nach dem gleichen prinzip wie in sterreich entstehen

4065889 i felt like i was doing the most serious drama that i had done in my career
4065890 and i think thats why those scenes are so funny because woody managed to make all of forget that we were doing pure comedy for us we were doing drama
4065891 i was looking for woody and he was hiding from me
4065892 if i dont do another take i torture myself for the rest of the day and then i remember everything from every take from every scene i remember all the takes
4065893 and i dont think thats good for my health or for my work but always everything is like that
4065894 there is no bulls t with woody which i love
4065895 he did say good morning its very nice to meet you
4065896 because i thought he was really himself and really honest and charming and when i said i would love to work with you
4065897 and they gave me the part so now i have to do it were going to be training very hard ive already been taking lessons but now its going to be many many hours a day were going to record with an orchestra and i think thats going to be an amazing experience because i love music

4065907 a 16th place time in 2008 would have been on the medal podium in 2004 i have friends in track and field and they ask whats up with all the world records i think its because track is a lot more advanced in its evolution than swimming but phelps is pushing everyone else to new heights

4065911 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4065912 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4065919 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4065934 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4065935 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4065937 an 11 year old boy from britain who was partially deaf for nearly 10 years was suddenly cured when a thick piece of cotton popped out of his ear according to a report in the daily mail
4065938 it was just incredible his hearing returned to normal in an instant
4065939 oh thank you but no im not really a chocolate truffle dipped in gold dust and creamy exotic wisps of delight kind of guy
4065940 you know i have eaten so much in my lifetime that i think ive lost my sense of taste so those
4065941 so you wanna leave me when times are tough fine i dont need you anyway get out
4065942 hey thats great you lost weight incredible that was soooo hard you really deserve to treat yourself go ahead after all your new habits are now a way of life so a little indulgence isnt going to hurt dont you think after all youve made it past the magic 30 day mark since 30 days have passed these new habits are all solidified and permanent right i mean even science agrees on that right
4065943 we pulled up the core sample and there it was stuck to the outside of the coring rod
4065944 most of our samples pull up a lot of silt and occasionally plant matter but nothing like this its a direct result of global thermal incubation
4065945 for some reason i just had to taste it and it was quite good
4065946 the only thing i noticed beyond the suit fitting differently was that i had an odd taste in my mouth sort of metallic or like the taste of a dentists mirror i didnt think much about it really but the suit was a little odd i thought i had put someone elses on
4065947 up here in the higher latitudes you can really pack away a lot more at mealtime plus the extra cushion keeps ya warmer

4065949 we hypothesized that the coexistence of the dna and the existence of a similar compound in the stomachs of mammoths was because well mammoths probably consumed a few hominids here and there
4065950 we have done every test known to man on the samples that we collect we simply never thought of putting them in a salad
4065951 i mean if dinosaurs coulda eaten it and lost weight heck im getting up there in years too i could eat some dinodiet food sure whatever why not ya know i mean are you kidding me
4065952 we will ask that you blog for 50 for the first month while we ascertain the value and advertising potential of the blog after that month we will likely need to restructure the network theres a reason it wasnt making any money redo the pay structure and even let some bloggers go but if you let us we will turn the network around and make it profitable we are fully committed to doing whats fair and in many ways being more than just fair
4065953 now it sounds like these guys are basically saying if you can put together a half dozen blogs that are all doing mid sized 150k pages month traffic you have something worth buying
4065954 but lets break this down real quick 1mm pageviews per month gives you 2mm high value impressions ie above the fold right now bloggers are lucky to be making 50c unit so thats 1000 month 1k month split amongst six blogs thats nothing
4065955 the reality is that small and medium blogs that have real value great content solid writers and an engaged community will always always always make more money from sponsorships than cpm based ads
4065956 the long and short is that grabbing a half dozen or even a few dozen blogs together wont net you cpms of more than 4 5 and even 5mm pageviews month only really nets the whole network 5k month
4065957 blogging included know nothing about selling advertising not only do they lack the resources to mount a dedicated ad sales effort they dont know what brand advertisers are looking for they dont speak the lingo and they dont have valuable madison avenue relationships
4065958 to get higher cpms you need someone to sell that inventory and that is where the bottleneck is its not in inventory or even quality inventory its someone that can go to agencies go to microsoft go to disney go to p amp g go to vonage go to dell and say heres somthing of value and heres why you should pay more for it
4065959 because without a sales team youre stuck in the 1 2 cpm world or youre stuck selling sponsorships which im a huge fan of for high quality mid sized blogs
4065960 can generate before making greater commitments its difficult to overlook the fact that b5media essentially wants
4065961 to continue writing for an amount that probably wont even fill up any of their cars with a single tank of gas
4065962 a respectable wage while it determines the value of their blogs just how compelling are the economics of blogging both for the bloggers and the operators of blog networks
4065963 are allegedly the words used by gawker media owner nick denton in a staff email
4065964 in the blogosphere is just the regurgitation of commoditized news
4065965 especially in these troubled economic times its difficult to retain skilled experienced writers with uncompetitive salaries or risky revenue share arrangements
4065966 you dont need to shortchange people with a 50 buck token pass to determine the worth
4065967 the income i earn from my blogging activities is not my primary source of income
4065968 listen were tight on cash but well pay you 500 for the month to fix as many or as few cars as you want after that were happy to pay you the same as all our other mechanics get which is above market rate
4065969 we want to see how this works out well pay you 30 000 year for the first 3 years and after that well propose a pay structure that we think youll find competitive
4065970 we arent asking bloggers to do a specific amount of work
4065971 and the scraps comment was made from a blogger who felt that he should earn more than the blogs revenue
4065972 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
4065973 some bloggers get paid per post like pieceworkers in a 19th century factory some get paid for pageviews which is even more idiotic from a workers perspective it means youre not paid for your labor except your monthly minimum but paid instead on a sort of gamble how well your product will perform when its thrown into the open marketplace
4065974 if youre blogging for someone other than yourself not as a commenter not as a personal blogger those are labors of love and dont count you deserve to be paid
4065975 why dont the airlines just automatically call me when my plane is delayed
4065976 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
4065977 its about a garage closing where no other garages in the world are hiring
4065978 how to hire and retain employees using depression era economics
4065979 well i understand its going to take you 40 hours to produce what i need but since i can only sell your work product for 500 i can only afford to pay you 7 hour even though i know your skill probably reasonably demands a 40 hour wage
4065980 there are plenty of jobs people take for no pay to try to get some experience or an opportunity e g tv for example
4065981 a musician who sells a few million copies of an album will potentially reap enough financial reward to make up for all the years of past and future struggles there is no real equivalent to this experience in the blogosphere you arent going to wake up to find one of your posts on the front page of digg and then check your bank account to find a few million dollars in it
4065982 instead of comparing bloggers to musicians i think a better comparison is made with songwriters and screenwriters
4065983 the bottom line is that the vast majority of bloggers arent entertainers and the amount of money being made by even the most
4065984 at best blogging is really not all that different from writing for a local daily
4065985 no matter what you do no matter what challenges you face with your new little one or how precious and delicate your newborn is there is one thing you have to do you have to have a date night at least once a month with no children and there is one rule that must not be broken on that date night you must not talk about the children it is the single most important thing to keep you sane and ultimately together
4065986 i am losing my m i n d how about you darling

4066014 it turns out that many of the habits of good manners that mom and grandma enforced had more merit than just keeping us from being considered obnoxious or distasteful in the company of others at their core good table manners are about dignity while eating at certain points in life some of us might pitch those habits out of the window ah college but over the span of your life in addition to making you good company at the dinner table practicing table manners may actually contribute to better health

4066041 ingat aku pernah mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda aku melihat abdurrahman bin auf masuk surga dengan perlahan lahan
4066042 kamu telah mengingatkanku pada suatu hadits yang tak pernah kulupakan
4066043 dengan ini aku mengharap dengan sangat agar kamu menjadi saksi bahwa kafilah ini dengan semua muatannya berikut kendaraan dan perlengkapannya ku persembahkan di jalan allah azza wajalla
4066044 sungguh kulihat diriku seandainya aku mengangkat batu niscaya kutemukan di bawahnya emas dan perak
4066045 semoga allah memberkati kamu isteri dan hartamu tunjukkanlah letaknya pasar agar aku dapat berniaga
4066046 wahai ibnu auf kamu termasuk golongan orang kaya dan kamu akan masuk surga secara perlahan lahan pinjamkanlah kekayaan itu kepada allah pasti allah mempermudah langkah kamu
4066047 harta abdurrahman bin auf halal lagi bersih dan memakan harta itu membawa selamat dan berkat

4066050 rasulullah saw telah wafat dan tak pernah beliau berikut ahli rumahnya sampai kenyang makan roti gandum apa harapan kita apabila dipanjangkan usia tetapi tidak menambah kebaikan bagi kita

4066054 sesungguhnya aku khawatir dipisahkan dari shahabat shahabatku karena kekayaanku yang melimpah ruah
4066055 orang orang yang membelanjakan hartanya dijalan alloh kemudian mereka tidak mengiringi apa yang telah mereka nafqahkan itu dengan membangkit bangkit pemberiannnya dan tidak pula kata kata yang menyakitkan niscaya mereka beroleh pahala di sisi tuhan mereka mereka tidak usah merasa takut dan tidak pula berdukacita

4066150 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4066151 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4066152 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4066153 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4066154 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4066155 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4066156 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet
4066157 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption

4066159 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
4066160 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
4066161 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
4066162 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
4066163 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
4066164 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light
4066165 the dark energy is simultaneously decreased just in front of the ship to decrease and bring to a stop the expansion rate of the universe in front of the ship
4066166 if the dark energy can be made negative directly in front of the ship then space in front of the ship would locally contract
4066167 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy

4066175 it makes you marvel at what these athletes will do we were thinking what must it be like to plummet from that height how can we capture the sensation
4066176 one of those lovely problems that keep you up at 4 a m building things in your mind
4066177 make you feel like you were in a race car looking sideways heading into the water
4066178 handstands are hardest divers go up a bit first you have to take the rope up then let go some people pick this up straight away others cant do it at all

4066180 yes i remember we took a picnic into the woods and thats when you said you wanted to join a nudist colony
4066181 yes it was great and i really made the most of it i went to a concert in the park and brought my yellow lab he snatched a sandwich right out of the hands of some poor woman having a picnic but we had fun
4066182 have you ever been to a concert in the park
4066183 yes you hate your math teacher and that reminds me of how much you hated your history teacher until you started to love her remember i mean things can change right
4066184 the porta potty is quite close to the womens tee on the seventh hole and some of the women have complained about the uh odor and noise
4066185 its close all right and we should move it to the mens tee
4066186 theres no time to rationalize no time to weigh the pros and cons of your response
4066187 so what in the world would make you want to join a crazy company like this where people work around the clock and just about everything changes every day

4066189 well if you love what youre doing i guess it doesnt matter does it

4066193 what did you think of the book did you like it

4066195 i see this within a spate of attacks against the army that could be reprisal attacks for the armys crushing of fatah al islam last year
4066196 a clear message to the army warning it against playing an effective role
4066197 may hasten sleimans demand for faster stability that will probably mean that a fast appointment of a commander in chief and heads of the security agencies
4066198 for that they will need a kind of green light from damascus
4066199 while in sydney to introduce her observational documentary pamela will definitely be on the loose and up for some good aussie fun
4066200 so dont surprised if you bump into her climbing the harbour bridge hitting the boutiques or even swimming with the sharks at oceanworld

4066207 plus its hilarious seeing our team members located upstairs and downstairs react in two completely different ways during an emergency
4066208 upstairs the team remained calm and followed earthquake drill procedures while the downstairs group completely did the opposite of that
4066209 the best reaction came from lead art director lawrence williford who tried to keep his cool as he rushed toward the front exit to escape as the ductwork and exit signs swayed above his head
4066210 this attempt at publicity just shows how simple it can be to take an event like an earthquake and turn it into a launching pad for viral marketing
4066211 this opportunity allowed us to drive traffic to our website without cost and without a significant investment of even time or energy

4066215 the victims were not going to lie down and go away some staged protests and even started up a victims justice group in cases such as this there is often great feeling and emotions can run very high when victims who have come forward to seek answers or redress for the abuse they suffered to have the door shut in the face by the authority responsible is a terrible thing and they say it is like being abused all over again
4066216 victims are often motivated by a sense of justice and wanting the truth to be heard which can make for uncomfortable listening at the other end they are brave to come forward and tell their stories of abuse bullying and neglect
4066217 city council deserves credit for listening to the victims and negotiating a settlement whilst it is impossible to put right the many wrongs suffered by the victims in their childhood it is the recognition that matters
4066218 i am delighted to announce that deidre will be assuming the role of president

4066232 it was true information overload as well as total task backlog all wrapped up in about four wonderful sunny florida days
4066233 we just learned so very much in such a short time that our heads are still foggy were hard at work every day attempting to put into practice all that we learned
4066234 we got buried and we just keep remembering more that we should be doing fortunately we are very good at organizing and prioritizing our tasks its kind of daunting but we just keep banging away its getting done little by little

4066250 yet many of the aspects of why a shotgun is utilized in standard defense do not apply to the undead which is why the shotgun should not be the preferred method of anti zombie weaponry
4066251 top 5 reasons you should not use a shotgun for zombie defense
4066252 secondly a shotgun does not need to be precisely on target to hit the target since it throws out a number of projectiles
4066253 your first order of business is to escape not fight especially if you are on your own firing your weapon should be your last resort and only if spotted since the report of the weapon will draw more
4066254 second if this is based on the average person they cant aim the spread of a shot gun makes aiming obsolete
4066255 just point at the head and pull the trigger baby
4066256 the only way to defeat is to band together and you need to use all sorts of tools to let your human presence be known as well as seeking out other humans barricading yourself in your room is in hopes that some group will eventually defeat the zombies and youll be safe a real american will be part of the group that hunts and defeats the zombies
4066257 i have always wondered if a flame thorougher may be more effective than any gun a garden sprayer filled with kerosene and a lighter may work better at least if your outside with nothing to burn but zombies and you can get them in any country
4066258 one should always carry a samurai sword for quick beheadings
4066259 i would want a 9mm because thats what all the gangstas use
4066260 the only weapon guaranteed to put a permanent hurt on the zombies is a full auto aa 12
4066261 you ladies ought to consider that when our ancestors faced the rise of the living dead they had no firearms whatsoever
4066262 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4066263 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4066264 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4066265 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4066266 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4066267 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4066268 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4066269 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4066270 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4066271 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4066272 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4066273 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4066274 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
4066275 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
4066276 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
4066277 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
4066278 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
4066279 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this

4066328 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
4066329 but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it
4066330 thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy as it entered the supercluster

4066348 the ultimate benefit of going through an energy crisis is that while its painful for a period of time because you are paying higher prices you are going to end up with a world that uses less crude oil higher prices would stimulate technological innovation in transportation and alternative energy and encourage consumers to make more energy efficient choices
4066349 all these things will reduce u s dependence on foreign oil and help improve our environment

4066674 the service was extremely attentive the crowd eclectic ambiance bustling even a tad bit loud since the room was fully occupied but not packed
4066675 we felt rushed and while the food and wine was good the service took away from the whole experience

4066679 after many years of living in new york and grappling with large crowds obnoxious service and mediocre overpriced food a bunch of us ventured into one of the other boroughs
4066680 all tasted fresh and succulent simple flavors and dishes as is often the case in italy that come together for amazing meals
4066681 little details like having a cocktail special every evening and the bartender is talented like offering from a selection of breads olive bread is especially good and really attentive service

4066693 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4066694 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4066695 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4066696 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4066697 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4066698 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4066699 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4066700 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4066701 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4066702 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4066703 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4066704 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4066705 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4066706 senior people in john holland were on site today to assure them that they remain part of the process
4066707 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4066708 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4066709 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4066710 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4066711 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4066712 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4066713 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4066714 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4066715 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4066716 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4066717 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4066718 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4066719 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4066720 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4066721 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4066722 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4066723 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4066724 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4066725 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4066729 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4066730 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4066731 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4066732 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4066733 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4066734 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4066735 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4066736 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4066737 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4066738 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4066739 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4066740 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4066741 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4066742 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4066743 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4066744 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4066745 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4066746 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4066747 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4066748 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4066749 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4066750 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4066751 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4066752 i havent seen the replays of my face yet but im pretty sure my expression would have said it all
4066753 steph kylie and i were just screaming the last lap we just wanted to win a whole lot and we knew that we had it because lindas the biggest fighter ever
4066754 bronte and i were jumping up and down when wed finished and we still had 400m to go
4066755 for me personally being able to share it with the rest of the girls was so much more exciting than an individual race
4066756 i was a bit disappointed with my individual swims and i was just so happy that i got the chance to be in the relay and prove myself
4066757 it really topped off my week winning that gold medal and it boosted my confidence even more
4066758 it was a different challenge for me to be able to mentally step up harder than i probably have before
4066759 this the first meet that ive really been in contention and able to battle it out with the other girls
4066760 i couldnt have asked for a better environment or better experience than what has happened in these olympics because to be able to prove that i was the best of the world at these olympics is what its all about
4066761 i dont really know whats going to happen when i get home but i have a really great management team and i know theyre going to do the best for me
4066762 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4066763 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4066764 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4066765 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4066766 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4066767 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4066768 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4066769 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4066770 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4066771 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4066772 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4066773 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4066774 who are open to doing something on the production side
4066775 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4066776 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4066777 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4066778 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4066779 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4066780 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4066781 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4066782 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4066783 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4066784 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4066785 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4066786 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4066787 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4066788 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4066789 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4066790 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4066791 philips park is also one corner of the medieval pilkington park deer park so we believe there is a lot more for us to come back and investigate in the future
4066792 presenting the philips house will help tell the story of prestwich and whitefield and be an important part of our bid to the heritage lottery fund to restore the park

4066798 put u s and russian military forces in close proximity amid an ongoing conflict
4066799 a rare event even in the decades when the u s faced off against the soviet union around the world
4066800 wednesday may have been one last swipe of humiliation for a defeated georgia a final reminder of russias military superiority
4066801 seems to have restored a sense of confidence among its officers
4066802 also allowed russia to claim that it could push deeper into georgia as part of so called additional security measures it was granted in the agreement
4066803 is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet
4066804 the events of the past five days wiped away any pretense that president dmitry medvedev runs the country
4066805 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4066806 we cannot allow georgia to become the first victim of a new world order as imagined by moscow

4066814 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4066815 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4066816 we did not have diaby fabregas rosicky nasri kolo toure eduardo and senderos while song is at the olympics
4066817 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4066818 my mindset was always that jonny was going to go back to united
4066819 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
4066820 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4066821 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4066822 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4066823 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4066824 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
4066825 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
4066826 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match

4066834 they love it up here but we just have to wait and see we would love to do that and love to do that as soon as possible
4066835 but obviously weve got to get the other things sorted out
4066836 maybe after last weekend people might want to reappraise the leinster championship maybe offaly and wexford are not as bad as people are talking about

4066839 theres been a wide engagement by the hdc talking to all different parties involved and hopefully we will come out with a set of proposals
4066840 whether we can get one set of proposals that everyone agrees with might be too much
4066841 been engaged in negotiations with potential new investors for the last number of weeks
4066842 it is too early to speculate on the outcome of these discussions which are still ongoing
4066843 the board of cork city football club will meet next week and come to a decision on the future of the club
4066844 some of the figures currently being reported today particularly in relation to the wages of players and staff are inaccurate and grossly inflated
4066845 because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing discussions it would be inappropriate for cork city football club to make any further comment at this time
4066846 its disappointing news the players are wondering whats happening just as much as the fans really
4066847 were meant to be one of the biggest clubs in the country but it now looks like were not going anywhere
4066848 weve been paid for the next two weeks so we will go into those two weeks and play the games and try and get through in the cup
4066849 were footballers we enjoy playing the game and we enjoy playing for cork city and were defending champions in the cup well concentrate on football over the weekend and see what happens on monday

4066867 germanys economy contracted less than feared in the second quarter but the underlying pace of activity has still dropped sharply
4066868 the german economy is not likely to fall into recession in the third quarter we expect a small rise in gdp with a rebound in private spending after the sharp decline in oil price
4066869 the players have to find and help a friend who has been drinking and whose condition is constantly deteriorating
4066870 as a result of this rather surprising media attention we have decided to remove the option of purchasing diet pills from the game
4066871 so lets all pretend again there are no diet pills in the world and thus there is absolutely no reason to discuss about them
4066872 computer and video games in formal and informal educational contexts
4066873 the first thing i was struck by when logging into the service was that my bimbo a looker kitted out only in her white knickers was already almost a stone overweight
4066874 players are moral agents and they do play a significant role in the moral construction of the game as an ethical experience this means that players are no more the victims of systems designed to conditioned them and turn them into mindless zombies players have an ethical understanding of the game which implies increasing their responsibility in the moral landscape of computer games because players are moral agents and do behave as such games have to take that into consideration allowing for players to develop their moral judgment in the game experience and through the game community

4066886 i am not being forced by anyone it is my own decision and i am doing so because of the good policies of the npp as compared to that of the ndc
4066887 however if i compare the npps school feeding capitation grant national health insurance and free medical care for pregnant women policies to the ndcs performance the npp is far ahead of the ndc hence my decision to resign from the ndc
4066888 i knew then that i needed to raise some money so i first sold my mobile phone but when i arrived in my home town my father had already undergone the surgery with the help of the national health insurance scheme without paying a penny
4066889 i am also aware of friends whose wives have benefited from the free medical care for pregnant women

4066894 land rover is a premium and expensive vehicle and very difficult to sell
4066895 we are particularly interested in ghana because of the developments that we have seen this year in kenya and more recently in zimbabwe these were countries that were touted as doing very well democratically and economically
4066896 we are disappointed at what we saw here there is a huge responsibility on the electoral commission to ensure that the process is credible and there is a level playing field for all the players to have confidence in the electoral process
4066897 must tamper their utterances and moderate their language in a way that does not inflame or incite violence
4066898 in 1975 you joined the department of nursing of the university of ghana as a lecturer and was promoted senior lecturer in 1980 and retired in 1981
4066899 as a chief nursing officer and head of the countrys nursing service from 1961 to 1974 and against strong opposition and the pessimism that the standards of nursing education would fall following the departure of expatriate nurses you showed initiative and with determination and strong imaginative leadership worked assiduously to raise the quality of those standards to new heights
4066900 if they think ipac is not necessary they should forget it
4066901 this is very embarrassing to the party i quite remember sometime ago when an energy forum was organised by a group of students at the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology in kumasi our flag bearer did not turn up it does not augur well for our party because such forums give the candidates the opportunity to convince the electorate about their programmes
4066902 it is becoming increasingly clear that john mahama who is the running mate is rather the leader of the ndc
4066903 how on earth should we as people denigrate both our current and former presidents publicly as if they were common criminals
4066904 at times leaderships of the two parties who should know better are regrettably the ones who lead the insulting crusade on the two statesmen for their uninformed faithful to follow
4066905 if you are in doubt about what im saying then listen to radio specifically in the mornings and you will appreciate what im talking about
4066906 i can tell you that if stringent measures are not taken to address the surging intolerance among the people violence that has the degree to plunge the country into perpetual turmoil could erupt as could be witnessed in certain countries
4066907 countries which have been thrown into a state of tumult as a result of electoral mishaps never thought of their present situations until they found themselves entangled in it
4066908 i strongly believe that aged presidents have paid their dues to the nation and it is now time for youthful presidents to come to the frail to contribute their quota
4066909 the day you see yourself as you are you will think it natural to be despised by others

4066922 im sorry i got mad at you and blamed you for hurting myself in the preliminaries
4066923 no no it isnt well yes it is everything everything is a mess
4066924 i try all my life to be good to do what i should do be who i should be and what does it get me a life of misery
4066925 my dad my dad expected a boy well actually thats not accurate my dad wasnt expecting anybody least of all me when my mom got pregnant they werent even married my dad was a computer programmer geek for apple he so wanted a son because thats all he knew how to relate to boys other men actually he didnt even know how to relate to humans anywhere near as much as computers thats what he named me macintosh figured hed call me mac and father and son would have a grand old time programming their lives away
4066926 i tried to please him i studied hard i learned to program but wasnt any good at it not like him
4066927 hed always find fault with anything i did nothing was ever good enough
4066928 and now im married to a guy who is just like my dad and i cant please him either
4066929 i cook for him i clean for him i play the dutiful wife
4066930 thats why pilates means so much to me its enough im even good at it and people appreciate me you like me
4066931 and i know fanny and ellen are using me to promote their own agenda but at least they are telling me im good at something
4066932 what am i going to do what am i going to do i should know i should know what am i going to do
4066933 ive done everything i should do and i still get dumped on it shouldnt be this way he shouldnt treat me this way
4066934 oh my god oh my god oh my god my god my god
4066935 hes having an affair with a fucking student of his
4066936 the water flows so must we and where we are now is not where we will be
4066937 so much of what will be will be but there is one thing that has a great influence on that
4066938 tosh let me ask you something what is a should
4066939 what is a should you are always talking about what you should do the way things should be what do you mean what is a should
4066940 the right way you know the way things should be
4066941 you talk and act like there is one right way and you and everyone else are trying to live up to that one right way
4066942 ive got news for you thats not the way it works
4066943 every time you hear or use the word should replace it with the word want
4066944 if it is something you want that is one thing if it is what somebody else wants you to want that is something completely different
4066945 you see shoulds are disguised wants shoulds are the disguised wants of others wanting you to want what they want you to want
4066946 when you live your life by shoulds you live your life trying to please the wants of others
4066947 they want you to believe there is an absolute right and then they want you to believe that they know that right better than you do so the big con is to get you to believe that what is out there matters more than what is in here
4066948 every time you say i should you are standing outside of your self judging your self
4066949 the worse seat in the house is in the peanut gallery with everybody else looking at yourself in judgement
4066950 i should is pernicious it undercuts your own self worth your own self image as long as you live in the world of shoulds you will always be miserable
4066951 but if i dont try to do what i should what else is there
4066952 what you want do what you want and be connected to who you are
4066953 no its being self centered in a very good way its coming from who you are from what you want out into the world
4066954 its pilates its being eccentric coming from the center out if you can move as well as you do theres no reason you cant think and choose your attitude to match your movement
4066955 you lived your whole life trying to please your father whatever would please your father became what you should do now youve got a husband instead of a daddy but nothing has changed you are living your life to please your husband you strive to do what you should do to gain acceptance
4066956 and sadly from my experience the more importance you place on acceptance from others the more you open yourself up for some serious suffering
4066957 shoulds are a way an evil way of others getting you to want what they want you to want as though it is what you want for yourself the only problem is what others want you to want and what you want are rarely the same thats why they get you to believe there is some absolute right outside of you that you should want to live up to the catch is that others want you to believe that absolute right is what they say it is
4066958 what is more important what you want or what somebody else wants
4066959 not what i want or your dad wants or your husband wants
4066960 yes up to a point but eventually wanting the pain to stop from seeking approval and not getting it will outweigh the wanting of approval thats the key that sets you free from your daddy from your husband you come first what you want matters the most i know it sounds selfish but it isnt its survival
4066961 ever heard the one about wanting what you cant have
4066962 you will hear i want come out of my mouth
4066963 whenever you hear the word should replace it with the word want and ask yourself who wants the world gets a whole lot clearer you suffer less and you feel a whole lot better about yourself

4067009 tambi n hay una inversi n en el c digo 06 que es remunerativo y que impacta sobe los que tienen menos antig edad
4067010 no s lo se abord el tema salarial sino que hubo una integralidad que no tuvo la reuni n anterior y el gobierno plante fuertemente el compromiso de continuar con las titularizaciones en las escuelas secundarias lo cual es muy importante porque los docentes queremos estabilidad
4067011 tambi n se plantearon los concursos y titularizaci n de los cargos electivos de escuelas de jornada completa y anexo albergue y se present un post t tulo para el a o que viene a llevar adelante por los institutos de formaci n docente que tiene que ver con una carrera docente relacionada a la formaci n y que venimos reclamando desde hace tiempo

4067016 si no hay voluntad pol tica del gobierno de incorporar los conceptos que nosotros entendemos que debe contener la nueva ley daremos el debate en la legislatura
4067017 estamos evaluando cual es el impacto en el bolsillo sobre todo en los cargos testigos los cargos simples los directivos y las horas c tedras de los profesores

4067022 been engaged in negotiations with potential new investors for the last number of weeks
4067023 it is too early to speculate on the outcome of these discussions which are still ongoing
4067024 the board of cork city football club will meet next week and come to a decision on the future of the club
4067025 some of the figures currently being reported today particularly in relation to the wages of players and staff are inaccurate and grossly inflated
4067026 because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing discussions it would be inappropriate for cork city football club to make any further comment at this time
4067027 its disappointing news the players are wondering whats happening just as much as the fans really
4067028 were meant to be one of the biggest clubs in the country but it now looks like were not going anywhere
4067029 weve been paid for the next two weeks so we will go into those two weeks and play the games and try and get through in the cup
4067030 were footballers we enjoy playing the game and we enjoy playing for cork city and were defending champions in the cup well concentrate on football over the weekend and see what happens on monday
4067031 were thinking of opening up a motley crue amusement park
4067032 yeah you can be buried in your own mick mars casket would it be gene simmons price
4067033 anybody ive played it for has gone wow motleys back
4067034 the album is loosely based on the dirt each song is like a mini story and you can plug in into the book some of its funny some of its serious and in your face its like a typical successful motley crue record
4067035 i wanted to hear a lot of guitars and snotty lyrics i didnt want loops and samples i dont want to be nine inch nails or jay z or rage against the machine or gwen stefani i dont wanna be over thought or over processed me and mick just wanted to sound like f ing motley crue
4067036 this wasnt four guys sitting in a room scratching their heads trying to create songs
4067037 these songs were written and then the whole band turned them into motley crue songs thats what albums like shout at the devil too fast for love and dr feelgood were on later albums we got into jam mode and it was hard to focus it wasnt songs first
4067038 so lets put em all together and put it out in front of tens of thousands of people around the country thats something to be proud of its important for us that rock continues
4067039 theres always people saying that rock is dead rock is over
4067040 running a festival is a learning experience and we have it really condensed
4067041 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4067042 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4067043 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4067044 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4067045 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4067046 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4067047 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4067048 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4067049 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4067050 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4067051 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4067052 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4067053 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4067054 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4067055 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4067056 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4067057 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4067058 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4067059 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4067060 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4067061 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4067062 el motivo del encuentro es el de informar los alcances del decreto 1013 08 que regula el estacionamiento medido en la ciudad que comenz a regir desde el 1 de agosto y acordar pautas comunes de trabajo para su implementaci n

4067066 ive been a part of their family functions many times i feel very close to her family whenever shes at a family function i try to be part of it
4067067 weve learnt to be careful in our public utterances as a celebrity one has to be careful one cant sit around being offended by the public attention
4067068 shall not be liable for any losses claims damages or expenses relating to any injury disease illness disability or death of the employees or subcontractors of the organization alleged to be caused as a result of performing the agreement
4067069 the organization agrees to fully protect and indemnify canada in the event of its employees and or subcontractors make any claims or demands against canada in respect of any of the risks inherent in the project or the adequacy of the information as to those risks supplied to the employees and subcontractors
4067070 cida is putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on canadian ngos to move into these areas particularly in kandahar
4067071 they are linking grant and aid contributions to demonstrating some sort of presence in kandahar city regardless of whether its safe
4067072 as a humanitarian organization our view is that if the government is sponsoring and encouraging an ngo to respond to a crisis wherever it may be that the government and the ngo jointly share responsibility

4067075 is probably 10 times harder to win now which is where ben ainslie is so amazing i am sure he will become britains most successful olympic sailor and he certainly deserves it
4067076 francis wouldnt accept it but i said you have done something far greater than i have achieved
4067077 my generation grew up knowing about rodney pattisson and his two golds and a silver
4067078 the difference between ben and i is that i did it all ably assisted by a crewman but ben has done it on his own
4067079 i tried to think of everything that would give me an advantage over my competitors
4067080 not because i thought it was any faster but i thought it would make people think i had an advantage
4067081 used to turn up in an army truck with five flying dutchmen dinghies and a commissar
4067082 i was probably the only sub lieutenant to bargain with an admiral and win
4067083 this is one of the biggest fines thats ever been handed to a restaurant owner in the city
4067084 lets have a funeral and bury it once and for all
4067085 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4067086 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4067087 i actually wrote a song for my new album called my baby its a real beautiful song
4067088 if they want to do it and they are talented enough i would support them but theyd have to express an interest on their own
4067089 id rather they didnt but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4067090 i would like you to know russias standing is permanent we support any decisions of the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia taken under the charter international convention of 1966 and helsinki act on security in europe and we will not only support but also guarantee them both in the caucasus and in the world
4067091 apostar siempre en el flop despu s de una subida preflop
4067092 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4067093 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4067094 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4067095 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4067096 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4067097 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4067098 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4067099 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4067100 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4067101 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4067102 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4067103 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4067104 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4067105 he records what it was really like to live there
4067106 that really was a fantastic day for a young man
4067107 none of these people are bad theyre just stupid kids
4067108 the title of the book is about that dead end but its also about righting the ship its about bringing things around
4067109 he really does get into who all of his characters are and gets into the circumstances and motivations of their lives
4067110 he also does really illustrate the structural realities of our society
4067111 on top of that theyre riveting reads he writes well
4067112 in other words all of these experiences in my life put me together with kids that were different than me
4067113 everyone was hopeful for a cub this year but at the same time we learned so much more about pandas and thats really why we do this
4067114 un nobile cavaliere il pi grande della sua epoca che pensava di poter cambiare il mondo un mondo fatto di malvagi tiranni guerre insensate illusionisti e streghe ammalianti tanto coraggioso quanto troppo pieno di fiducia verso il prossimo questo fu il suo pi grande fallimento dalla sua ebbe la fortuna di avere sempre accanto amici che credevano in lui ma il suo lato pi umano lo mostrava debole inaffibadile parlava con il cuore invece con il cervello in unepoca dove la forza dalla spada e il potre della magia era dominante alla fine dovette cedere pensare soltanto a sopravvivere tra i fumi della guerra scordando gli occhi di chi lo aveva incantato e guidando le persone che gli erano state accanto e avevano creduto in lui in una nuova terra promessa anche se il prezzo sarebbe stato la sua anima
4067115 because oil prices are determined on the international market any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
4067116 if i say it over and over that must make it true
4067117 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4067118 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4067119 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4067120 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4067121 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4067122 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4067123 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4067124 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4067125 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4067126 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4067127 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4067128 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
4067129 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4067130 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4067131 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4067132 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4067133 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4067134 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4067135 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4067136 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4067137 the biggest myth is that anorexia is about being thin
4067138 you could go to any eating disorder clinic around the world and the core clinical picture would be identical
4067139 crapping out the window of a five story building while showing your co workers a nipple
4067140 sadly the latest salvo of spam hitting our inboxes is likely to trick unsuspecting email users with its topical headlines and the seemingly trusted source
4067141 but by now everyone should be well aware of this kind of dirty trick and should never click on links in unsolicited emails
4067142 the malware on the webpage pointed to in the emails downloads further malicious code from the internet the hackers can obviously change that code and its aim at any time but presently it downloads rogue anti virus software that tries to scare users into buying a bogus product
4067143 if you do so of course you will be handing over your credit card details to people who have already proven they are prepared to break the law
4067144 between four and five months incarceration is within the written guidelines for sentencing
4067145 there is no indication that she is any sort of threat to society
4067146 she was almost 65 had never been arrested and she stood out in the jail population
4067147 in her recounting of events everybody else is at fault
4067148 everybodys made out to be the bad guy her brother the nursing home staff the police everybody except for her and shes the loving daughter well a loving daughter does not try and kill her mother
4067149 she was just standing in the driveway rocking the newborn who was still attached to the placenta
4067150 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
4067151 of course they are entitled to take things from georgians now because they lost their own property in tskhinvali and other places
4067152 isnt that what they georgians have been doing to us these old people shouldnt be complaining they should be happy they werent killed
4067153 acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population
4067154 the russian government should be held to this promise to punish looters but much more needs to be done to ensure that all sides protect civilians
4067155 tell your men not to open fire if they dont shoot we arent going to shoot either
4067156 drug dealers are using the internet to move from the back alleys into our living rooms
4067157 customers who havent even seen a physician can illegally purchase addictive pain killers and other controlled substances from so called online pharmacies
4067158 but modern technology cant disguise the fact that buying prescription drugs online can be as dangerous as taking drugs offered by a street corner thug
4067159 narcotics sold over the internet have led to deaths overdoses and addiction nationwide we are determined to shut down these dangerous and illegal web sites and prosecute those who profit from them
4067160 nearly as many hispanics get health information from television as from doctors and medical professionals
4067161 whats more hispanics who dont have a usual health care provider are more likely to get health information from television than they are from medical professionals
4067162 when it comes to meeting the health needs of hispanics in america one size does not fit all
4067163 national and community health experts need to factor in differences between sub groups such as language spoken assimilation and country of origin and develop innovative solutions that meet the diverse needs of the latino community
4067164 grassroots single payer activists successfully pushed the democratic party platform committee to propose guaranteed health care for all this is a huge improvement from their previous language that merely endorsed universal coverage which is often a euphemism for the right to purchase private health insurance we know from past state experiments that this right is meaningless as were now seeing in massachusetts private coverage comes with such burdensome restrictions co payments and deductibles that patients still cant afford the care they need we need to continue to push for non profit tax funded national health insurance
4067165 all seven reforms which when launched were widely trumpeted by political leaders and leading newspapers as breakthroughs in providing universal health care were based on the expansion of private insurance coverage
4067166 politicians like to claim theyve passed bold health reforms but theyre afraid to rock the private insurance boat so they keep pushing gussied up versions of reforms that have failed time after time our health care system is sick to death and our politicians keep prescribing placebos
4067167 its easy to build political consensus for expanded health coverage
4067168 thats the only way kids will be able to learn the skills theyll need to take care of themselves when they become adults
4067169 there have always been parents who would fit the definition of helicopter parents they used to be called overprotective parents but the idea of parents who hover over their children to shield them from possible distress is as old as parenting
4067170 questioning is not bad as long as parents are willing to listen and there is true dialogue
4067171 when it results in uncompromising demands however it can become a real barrier to the childs maturity and self reliance
4067172 hey we gotta play fighting games you wanna take us for some cash
4067173 this will be fundamental in our efforts to move britain towards a low carbon economy in the decades ahead
4067174 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4067175 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4067176 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4067177 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4067178 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4067179 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4067180 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4067181 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4067182 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4067183 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4067184 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4067185 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4067186 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4067187 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4067188 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4067189 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4067190 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4067191 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4067192 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4067193 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4067194 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4067195 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4067196 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4067197 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4067198 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4067199 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4067200 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4067201 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4067202 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4067203 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4067204 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4067205 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4067206 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4067207 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4067208 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4067209 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4067210 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4067211 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4067212 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4067213 these are all small things and they all add up
4067214 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4067215 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4067216 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4067217 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4067218 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4067219 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4067220 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him

4067222 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4067223 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4067224 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4067225 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

4067231 in tune with public opinion and hes aware that public opinion doesnt support killing someone who has such a diminished role as an accomplice
4067232 he should be given life without parole in a maximum security unit and perhaps he could serve his time with the man who pulled the trigger
4067233 the juxtaposition of one man who did not kill being executed and another man who did kill being pardoned just stuck in peoples craw
4067234 what do you think is going to happen when a guy goes into a convenience store to rob it and hes armed with a gun and your job is to help him commit that crime

4067241 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4067242 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4067243 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4067244 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am

4067247 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4067248 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

4067256 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4067257 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4067258 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

4067269 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4067270 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm

4067273 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4067274 morgenavond ben ik de bob en mocht er iets gebeuren kan ik de drank nog niet eens de schuld geven
4067275 kijk ook even regelmatig op onze website voor de actuele vacatures wat me dan verbaast is dat
4067276 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4067277 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4067278 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4067279 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4067280 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4067281 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4067282 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4067283 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4067284 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4067285 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4067286 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4067287 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4067288 theyre working through it and have been cutting down fencing
4067289 theyre up against the size of the fire and getting water resources together to get in front of the fire

4067296 iaitu mereka umat islam yang jika kami berikan mereka kekuasaan memerintah bumi nescaya mereka mendirikan solat serta memberi zakat dan mereka menyuruh berbuat kebaikan serta melarang dari melakukan dan mungkar dan ingatlah bagi allah jualah kesudahan segala urusan
4067297 sebuah masyarakat dan pemerintahan yang terlaksana dalamnya nilai nilai hidup islam dan hukum hukumnya menuju keredhaan allah
4067298 wahai orang orang beriman janganlah kamu dilalaikan oleh urusan harta benda kamu dan anak pinak kamu daripada mengingati allah dengan menjalankan perintahnya dan ingatlah siapa yang berbuat demikian maka mereka itulah orang orang yang rugi
4067299 patutkah manusia menyangka bahawa mereka kamu akan dibiarkan hanya berkata

4067312 i was really confused then because at first i thought i was black then i thought i was hispanic and joined a cholo gang
4067313 i had somebody else ask me that because of sex and the christinas not mousy
4067314 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4067315 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

4067322 made offensive comments on the muslim world islam and muslims in bangladesh and commented about the existence of al qaeda and other islamist militant groups by which you have tarnished the image of bangladesh in the outside world
4067323 look everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive
4067324 our devotion to watching listening and staying in touch wherever and whenever we want shows no sign of diminishing and with healthy competition overall prices offer increasing value for money that is what consumers demand and what ofcom helps deliver

4067330 i do what i have to do for business but i do try to consolidate if i have clients in one area i try to see them at the same time
4067331 i would hope prosecutors would do a pretty exploratory review of cases while costley was in the homicide division to make sure that everything that is in the file that should have been turned over was in fact turned over to the defense
4067332 and i hope that any police officers involved in those cases given that police withheld information from miss costley in one of them will be asked whether they turned over everything to prosecutors
4067333 we will never be able to say with 100 percent certainty more than a decade later what exactly occurred but it is critically important in the interest of justice that we proceed with the new trial
4067334 if i dismiss this case it certainly would provide a shocking deterrent effect to the police department when it comes down to providing information to the state so that it can be properly disclosed to the defense
4067335 you would agree that forever now and today the noakes hill case would stand as a reason why the police ought to sit down with the states attorneys office and be sure absolutely positively sure that there are reports disclosed and shown it would ensure justice in this city for any other defendant that might be charged
4067336 it was very frustrating to the defense and i do believe they have done better
4067337 also the rules have recently changed which should make this sort of thing never happen again
4067338 no further in depth review was done at that time or has been requested or ordered
4067339 the administration hoped that their name wouldnt be attached to yet another escape under their watch
4067340 i think they were trying to cover it up at the expense of the public
4067341 so the public is aware that there is a potential public safety threat
4067342 if my daughter and two grandchildren are traveling in that area i want them to hear a radio report and be on the lookout the public has a right to know
4067343 we cannot put the intelligence and communications on which our troops rely in jeopardy unfortunately as this report makes clear they would be at grave risk if fort monmouth were to close
4067344 if the work at fort monmouth werent important to the lives and effectiveness of our troops maybe they could justify this move but as is this is without justification
4067345 confirms that the upcoming move is on track to be a success

4067364 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4067365 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4067366 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4067367 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4067368 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4067369 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4067370 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4067371 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4067372 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low

4067422 georgia is a small neighbor of russia it is a country that has made considerable progress in terms of its economy it is still trying to secure its democratic institutions and weve worked with georgia on that but if anyone had any doubts about our support for georgia you only have to look at the fact that its a millennium challenge country which is one of the most important designations that the united states can make that we believe in the future of that country

4067430 when farmers clear and terrace the land for planting they have to remove great chunks of lava stone which they amass in one place
4067431 there was one such pile in the center of our property so we encased it with reinforced cement and made it the foundation for our house
4067432 within the confines of the park of etna which starts a little higher up the mountain you can only rebuild existing dwellings so even decrepit huts are prized
4067433 outside the park area you can buy agricultural land that will vary in price from 30 000 to 100 000 a hectare
4067434 coal is indispensable to u s electric generation and will remain so for years to come but the power industry must tackle the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and do a better job of explaining that coal can be a clean fuel
4067435 half the generation in the united states will continue to be from coal
4067436 there needs to be a national greenhouse gas emissions policy but one that is gradual and rational

4067441 clearly everybody would want every young person to get the best education possible provided for them
4067442 there will be all sorts of explanations for the differences and they wont all necessarily lie in the education provision in the regions
4067443 the things that affect how young people perform in school are many and varied
4067444 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap in achievement between different areas of the country
4067445 it underlines yet again the need for reform to create new good school places so that children in the less well off areas get the same opportunities as others

4067458 there is no alternative to the general approach of the lisbon treaty therefore member states and european politicians should not surrender to agony but go on designing european policy in the spirit of this treaty i e creating a climate of political and social progress and economic strength europe is no doubt a success story and ireland itself is proof of that

4067465 we hope to play soccer and find a rhythm a battle will be some sort of 50 50 situations we like to keep possession and find a rhythm and i think that will be our chance to win the game
4067466 the first 10 minutes will be tough and whoever dictates the tempo has the chance to win the game
4067467 for us to be in the olympics for the first time and to be in the quarterfinals three matches away from a medal is a great feeling
4067468 i really think that three four or five teams are still at the top at the moment and are the real contenders for the top titles but now to be at the top we teams have to work much better harder than before
4067469 i dont really see four or five teams any more
4067470 por el momento pensamos que estos 25 son los mejores jugadores es bonito que todos tengamos opiniones sobre la lista se le cuestion por qu no estaban borgetti y de nigris pero creo que en este momento es la lista m s justa m s precisa

4067474 es un tema siempre interesante en los juegos de calificaci n rumbo a un mundial ganar siempre es lo m s importante porque son tres puntos pero para ganar casi siempre se tiene que jugar bien porque si se juega siempre mal se gana poco claro que el objetivo es jugar bien pero el objetivo principal es la clasificaci n al mundial

4067494 most of the people who hate us are people it is truly an honour to be hated by reactionary creeps with strange agendas and the daily mail most people who know about modern pop culture know about gta and like or dislike it on its own merits
4067495 i think we are both depressed at how boring we really are and how unexciting even the worse fabrications and exaggerations are when you read about them
4067496 none of it seems very rock and roll so we find it a little sad when there are probably better stories that could be written about both us and the industry medium
4067497 it was difficult for us to find the way to the goal
4067498 there were too many shots to the post the defence worked well the goalkeeper was good and only 22 goals against you should be enough
4067499 not really but i have always believed that if you never give up a good result will follow i am glad it worked out well

4067503 as hotel market supply grows in the coming years and there is increasing competition from the number of hotel apartments entering the market it is likely that hotel apartments will shift focus to longer stay guests
4067504 for a city based hotel operation combining hotel apartments with hotel rooms provides a more diverse product that offers greater scope for revenue management and can potentially attract a wider guest market however standalone hotel apartment operations in the right locations are also successful
4067505 the concept works well in dubai because there is an increasing number of business travellers who tend to have an undefined time frame these people do not wish to stay in hotels over an indefinite period of time and so serviced residences offer an ideal base without the commitment of long term rent payments
4067506 with an increase in tourists and business travellers a niche in the serviced residences and hotel apartments industry has been identified

4067530 we are pumping gas again into the south caucasus pipeline
4067531 the baku supsa pipeline remains suspended for the time being it goes through the middle of the country
4067532 its a different route from scp so were still assessing the security implications and that remains suspended
4067533 while the conflict in georgia may have been the main source of attention for us the most significant supply event was the attack on the btc line in turkey and the implication that it may continue to be a target and one the length of which makes it virtually impossible to defend comfortably

4067541 the board and the staff are just very focused for every adoptable animal that comes to our shelter there is a home its our job just to find that home
4067542 i think being open seven days a week really had an effect
4067543 i also think with the advent of the internet more and more people are online our website www upaws org is updated every night with animals as they come up for adoption
4067544 the more animals that we have here the more time it takes to clean them make sure theyre getting exercise and generally taking care of them on a day to day basis
4067545 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
4067546 we have a pretty good idea that the restrictions will slow things down but we wont know the true impact until september
4067547 because of the olympics and other factors therell no doubt be higher prices
4067548 the olympics impact is one of a number of things happening associated with china to make companies rethink their sourcing strategies
4067549 its adding to the larger psychological effects of risk associated with working in china
4067550 for those limited companies that still produce goods for export in beijing they probably shifted some production to other facilities in china to meet u s consumer demand
4067551 the impact on u s consumers is most likely nil
4067552 many companies have said to the chinese because of this the christmas orders cant be filled and we cant move christmas to february
4067553 so now those purchase orders have gone to other countries

4067558 i think swift has taken a lot of people by surprise
4067559 he had been a minor lawyer defending wayward service personnel on things like child molestation charges
4067560 suddenly hes appointed by the pentagon to defend an enemy combatant and he ends up suing george w bush its difficult not to be impressed by his sense of duty by the idea that justice transcends the allegiances of war im sure thats part of the appeal to george clooney
4067561 had this extraordinary relationship suddenly a man in a military uniform walks into his room one day and says hi im charlie swift im your lawyer you can trust me hamdan would go on hunger strike after hunger strike and here was this man in a uniform literally trying to feed him and stop him from going mad several times hamdan tried to sack the man who wanted to save him but swift refused to budge

4067572 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4067573 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4067574 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4067575 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4067576 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4067577 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4067578 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4067579 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4067580 just so you all know we did set a record
4067581 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4067582 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4067583 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4067584 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4067585 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

4067589 tying the hands of councils leaving them unable to respond to the legitimate concerns of local people
4067590 would appear to remove access to any remedy for local health or environmental impacts caused by dust smoke odour noise or light
4067591 it is totally unacceptable that people should not be able to complain about noise light pollution and general disturbances to their day to day lives
4067592 councils need to be able to hold construction companies to account to ensure that disruption for local people is kept to an absolute minimum
4067593 the planning bill will ensure that anyone who suffers nuisance will be able to seek compensation which is a quicker and more reliable route than the uncertainty of a nuisance claim which can be misused by lawyers trying to block development by simply firing off injunctions causing unnecessary delay to decisions
4067594 it does not immunise developers and will ensure there is a clear and accountable process in place for everyone
4067595 can you imagine a journalist being as chummy with his subjects as chris collinsworth was with deborah phelps at the mens 200m freestyle surely you saw it the joking the holding the celebrating the tension between sports journalism and journalism proper has been thick since last friday russia invades georgia during the opening ceremonies held by of all countries china should the announcers and reporters bring in politics and if so how and how often of whom should they be critical whom should they laud and why is president bush posing for photos with bikini clad females and doing an interview with bob costas without even blushing
4067596 by en vogue well im not talking about a song nor john edwards but john mccain
4067597 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

4067606 the olympic games has a huge economic effect on the host country
4067607 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4067608 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4067609 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4067610 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4067611 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4067612 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4067613 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4067614 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4067615 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4067616 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

4067618 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4067619 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4067620 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4067621 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4067622 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4067623 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4067624 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4067625 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work

4067627 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4067628 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4067629 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4067630 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4067631 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4067632 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4067633 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4067634 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4067635 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4067636 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4067637 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4067638 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4067639 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4067640 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4067641 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4067642 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4067643 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4067644 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4067645 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative

4067647 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
4067648 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
4067649 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
4067650 cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak
4067651 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades
4067652 temperatures have already fallen by about 0 5 degrees c over the past 12 months and if this is only the start of it it would be a serious concern
4067653 a large contingent of georgia army national guard soldiers flew to the republic of georgia on sunday for joint military exercises at a time when tension is brewing in the region
4067654 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4067655 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4067656 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
4067657 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4067658 se os pais t m 50 ou 60 anos e v o perder o emprego vai lhes ser muito dif cil recuperar o trabalho porque estamos a falar de pessoas com muito poucas qualifica es que dificilmente encaixam no sector dos servi os
4067659 por m se com os pais era dif cil e ter amos de lhes valer atrav s das medidas de apoio social j quanto aos filhos poder se ia ter feito muito mais
4067660 poder se ia ter pensado na tentativa de os manter na escola uma coisa t o simples como haver salas de apoio ao estudo projecto comunit rios entre outros
4067661 tanto na inf ncia como na adolesc ncia poder se ia ter feito muita coisa para impedir ou minorar aquilo que veio a verificar se que um abandono escolar um insucesso escolar
4067662 a escola ser uma realidade afastada destas crian as e evidentemente que quando a escola uma realidade afastada o futuro laboral delas est comprometido
4067663 e da ingressarem muitas vezes em economias como a droga ou o sub proletariado que a m o de obra flutuante
4067664 no fundo os mi dos destes bairros foram um bocado condenados a isto porque n o conseguimos perceber que a escola tinha que lhes valer rapidamente
4067665 estamos a falar dos netos e dos filhos dos oper rios que hoje n o t m industria preciso encarar a resolu o destes problemas integradamente n o basta achar que tudo isto se resolve infraestruturalmente
4067666 tem sido lenta a entrada nas institui es de um pensamento mais alargado sobre como enfrentar estes problemas que s o muito s rios mas demora s que quando se tem uma cidade como esta estes tipo de quest es t m de estar em cima da mesa de qualquer respons vel pol tico
4067667 a solu o do problema pode voltar a ser um problema
4067668 the computer is a speed demon it will allow us to solve tremendous problems
4067669 n o podemos ir de demoli o em demoli o at vit ria final
4067670 o presidente da c mara municipal do porto rui rio ir apresentar uma solu o para aquele que actualmente considerado o bairro mais problem tico da cidade do porto
4067671 as pol ticas habitacionais n o se resumem constru o de uma casa e entrega de uma chave
4067672 parece existir uma rela o entre os problemas das cidades e a forma geogr fica como se distribuem as pessoas ou seja parece ser uma m op o concentrar pessoas de um determinado estatuto social tnico o que seja em territ rios restritos
4067673 a concentra o de pessoas no aleixo ou a concentra o de pessoas de classe alta na foz nova s o formas menos adequadas de se viver na cidade tudo somado a minha opini o relativamente ao aleixo que a solu o para um problema pode voltar a ser um problema
4067674 n o podemos ir de demoli o em demoli o at vit ria final
4067675 a pol tica de demolir tem sido uma usada mas nem sempre com o grau de efic cia que se pode esperar
4067676 eficaz no ponto de vista local na erradica o de um ponto na cidade
4067677 h muitas d vidas na sua efic cia a longo prazo sobretudo se o processo que crucial e frequentemente o mais negligenciado nas nossas pol ticas habitacionais de realojamento n o for bem feito
4067678 independentemente das convic es pol ticas que se possam ter sobre esta mat ria as pol ticas habitacionais n o se resumem constru o de uma casa e entrega de uma chave n o podem passar apenas por isso para serem eficazes precisam de outras medidas que permitam inser es laborais escolares etc
4067679 n o podemos ir de demoli o em demoli o at vit ria final estamos a falar de popula es que precisam de uma resposta do estado e eu n o sei se o estado tem condi es para por artes m gicas resolver o problema na base das demoli es sucessivas uma solu o que pode resultar mas n o propriamente uma experi ncia piloto
4067680 se tentar encontrar um modelo alternativo de habita o social mais coadunado com a cidade existente
4067681 isto implica uma aposta deliberada na reabilita o tamb m para fins sociais o que temos visto nas cidades europeias que essa reabilita o para fins sociais n o tem sido uma prioridade vamos ver o que v o ser as sru sociedades de reabilita o urbana mas tudo indica que n o venham a ter essa componente
4067682 a magia do curto prazo deveria fazer nos reflectir sobre os problemas do m dio e longo prazo
4067683 uma pessoa tem de come ar a pensar que no porto h muito pouco espa o novo para construir e muita coisa que se tem transformado
4067684 demolir um bairro para fazer outro bairro n o faz sentido agora demolir os bairros para se fazer cidade onde coabitam popula es de v rios n veis sociais perfeitamente l gico preciso ter coragem
4067685 as pessoas v o ter o nus de vir do bairro do aleixo
4067686 a c mara pode estar a refor ar a tend ncia natural do mercado que aumentar as assimetrias dentro da cidade e portanto se essas pessoas n o v o ser realojadas na foz nem em nevogilde nem em lordelo do ouro para onde que elas v o v o para a s s nicolau campanh bonfim as reas onde existem casas vazias mais pobres problemas sociais diversos
4067687 v o aumentar o problema da cidade a m dio prazo
4067688 a magia do curto prazo deveria fazer nos reflectir sobre os problemas do m dio e longo prazo
4067689 evitar constru o de habita o social no lado oriental da cidade
4067690 o cumprimento de objectivos sociais por parte dos promotores imobili rios nomeadamente atrav s da afecta o a habita o social de uma quota parte da habita o nova ou a reabilitar ou ainda no mbito de opera es integradas de revitaliza o urbana
4067691 foi algo que os franceses descobriram h muitos anos muitos dos bairros eles demoliram nos e fizeram acordos com os empreiteiros numa regra que ainda t m que quando constroem um bairro uma percentagem das habita es s o para a habita o de pessoas que n o t m possibilidades
4067692 the original commission didnt get to the bottom of anything we need to investigate from scratch
4067693 as foreign correspondents poured into tbilisi a team of belgian pr advisers launched a slick operation to keep them updated with e mail alerts detailing the latest alleged aggressions by russia and the georgian governments reaction
4067694 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
4067695 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
4067696 the hyper threaded 3 0 ghz intel pentium 4 630 processor allows a single cpu system to behave in some aspects like a dual cpu system helping to deliver faster transistors and increased performance it also features a large 2 mb l2 cache and a blazingly fast 800 mhz front side bus speed which measures how fast a processor and the main memory communicate an l2 or secondary cache temporarily stores data and a larger l2 cache can help speed up your systems performance a hyper threading processor helps a pc to run multiple demanding applications at the same time this technology enables the processor to execute two threads a part of a program in parallel boosting performance during key high drain procedures this results in more efficient software performance such as faster reaction times in gaming applications and enhanced multitasking
4067697 o problema do aleixo est na hist ria tem de se ter uma ideia de como que se fizeram os bairros camar rios e de como se fez o bairro do aleixo
4067698 o bairro do aleixo o ltimo dos bairros antes do 25 de abril aqui no porto e correspondia a uma tentativa de fazer um bairro camar rio noutra tipologia em torre
4067699 os bairros camar rios foram feitos nos anos 50 e 60 numa base de especula o imobili ria ou seja tiravam se as pessoas das ilhas no centro da cidade e punham nas na periferia construindo se a os bairros
4067700 dez anos depois tinha se feito realmente um grande esfor o mas j come avam a levantar se vozes alertando para os problemas sociais
4067701 governan a das pol ticas territoriais e urbanas do n vel da uni o europeia ao n vel local
4067702 o que se passou foi que nos anos 70 se acreditava que a sobreocupa o no barredo se resolvia com o realojamento das pessoas em pr dios modernos
4067703 que a solu o ter sido pior que o problema de base
4067704 ao juntar pessoas de varias reas designadamente do barredo em contextos habitacionais completamente distintos daqueles a que estavam habituados e num evidente isolamento em rela o envolv ncia
4067705 n o foi apenas abandonado pelo poder aut rquico desta c mara porque o bairro do aleixo existe desde 1976 de algum modo h ali um abandono das pessoas sua sorte e tamb m por ser sistematicamente olhado como o bairro das drogas
4067706 fez dali uma esp cie de gueto portuense em que as pessoas foram sendo tratadas nessa medida e h uma profecia que se auto cumpre como dizem os soci logos que tanto se diz que aquilo mau que aquilo um bairro de tr fico que depois os problemas ficam ali cristalizados
4067707 a ideia do bairro em que estava metido tudo tinha igreja tinha escola entre outros equipamentos o que levava cria o de guetos se isso n o feito de uma forma aberta o que acontece que a crian a nasce no bairro e tem tudo ali n o est inserida numa socializa o adequada hoje pensa se exactamente o contr rio
4067708 do ponto de vista arquitect nico e social aquilo n o tem p s nem cabe a
4067709 n o estou a dizer que o que vai para l tenha
4067710 o facto de na altura ser h bito construir se uma escola para servir o bairro ao contr rio de um movimento de integra o fez com que as crian as do bairro convivessem apenas com as outras crian as do bairro e isso fomentou uma cultura de gueto ou seja procura de uma solu o agravou se o problema
4067711 a escola tinha de saber adaptar se e n o soube
4067712 o porto um laborat rio de muitas solu es em mat ria urbana foi uma cidade muito afectada pela industrializa o n o estava preparada para o crescimento r pido que sofreu com a industrializa o e por isso foi improvisando solu es
4067713 n s somos herdeiros das solu es e da aus ncia de solu es que a nossa cidade gerou n o tendo resolvido os problemas da industrializa o no tempo devido temos agora que lidar com os problemas da desindustrializa o da cidade temos uma desindustrializa o do espa o mas tamb m das pessoas
4067714 a solu o do problema pode voltar a ser um problema
4067715 raia a indignidade as pessoas serem tratadas como um objecto que pode ser mudado daqui para ali sem que lhes seja perguntado nada
4067716 n o um bom sinal que as pessoas n o tenham sido ouvidas
4067717 nestas coisas vai se sempre a tempo de fazer alguma coisa
4067718 qualquer solu o deste foro e uma solu o pesada deve implicar ouvir as popula es que devem ser parte activa das decis es seria importante que fossem parte da resolu o do problema isso parece me muito importante isso que tem sido feito infelizmente n o entre n s
4067719 a minha opini o que essa decis o s podia ser tomada depois de ouvir a popula o e ouvir a popula o em primeiro lugar ouvir os seus representantes uma decis o dessas num pa s democr tico implica um processo democr tico que ouvir quem l vive
4067720 falar com as pessoas depois das decis es tomadas tem a ver com minimiza o de estragos n o tem a ver com uma verdadeira participa o
4067721 ouvidas partida nem na montagem de todo este programa quem ouvido na montagem do programa s o os privados que muito legitimamente t m como objectivo a obten o de lucro e n o a resolu o de problemas sociais
4067722 espantoso verificar como as coisas n o correm t o mal como aquilo que poderiam correr
4067723 a frase vale o que vale mas isto n o argumento para desresponsabilizar ningu m contudo o argumento para responsabilizar as autoridades que s o para todos os efeitos as entidades respons veis pela exist ncia destes contextos
4067724 porque do ponto de vista da nossa pol tica social temos andado a fazer o pior que se pode fazer
4067725 se rui rio ouvir as fam lias como prometeu mostra que aprendeu com a experi ncia do bairro s o jo o de deus
4067726 se a c mara mostrar que aprendeu um passo em frente importante que foi dado
4067727 se for conduzido a pensar nas pessoas ter consequ ncias novas ou seja sobretudo se houver vontade da c mara poderia ser encontrado um patamar de entendimento m tuo positivo para as pessoas e para a autarquia
4067728 se o processo do novo realojamento n o for bem conduzido os problemas que existem naquele sitio que vem abaixo v o ser transportados para outros s tios
4067729 se este processo de realojamento se verificar de acordo com o que deve ser haver as tais conversas caso a caso e encontrar se a melhor solu o para cada fam lia ou para cada grupo familiar alargado
4067730 n o podemos ter um novo s o jo o de deus
4067731 um processo que tem de ser mediado os t cnicos da c mara t m que ouvir as fam lias e chegar s melhores conclus es para cada caso uma coisa que demora e porque exige paci ncia e talento do ponto de vista da negocia o social muitas vezes passa se por cima e faz se de qualquer maneira
4067732 de v rias maneiras mas no essencial os problemas resolvem se com as pessoas e n o em torno de pr dios e de ruas um aspecto que tem estado muito ausente na nossa c mara parece que os problemas se resolvem dinamitando pr dios
4067733 temos no s o jo o de deus uma situa o que funcionou como um laborat rio social em termos de se perceber o que que acontece numa opera o quando feita de um modo violento reproduz os problemas e foi reproduzi los para o bairro do cerco para a pasteleira nova
4067734 n o podemos ter um novo s o jo o de deus se tivermos isso significa que n o h respeito pelas popula es mais pobres n o houve respeito no s o jo o de deus era bom que houvesse agora
4067735 n s quando mudamos de casa porque optamos faz lo
4067736 a solu o do problema pode voltar a ser um problema
4067737 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4067738 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4067739 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4067740 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4067741 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4067742 the business combination of indorama and la seda will create a world class company in this otherwise fragmented industry where the cost of petrochemical feedstock has eroded the margins to an uncomfortable level and only with differentiation scale and efficiency will companies be able deliver an adequate return on capital
4067743 indoramas strength in operations management and its differentiated asset quality together with the scale and product portfolio that la seda can contribute has the potential to create a sustainable and strong enterprise that will go on to serve its stakeholders in a rewarding and above average manner

4067748 biopharmaceutical companies require robust technology solutions to increase the efficiency and productivity of clinical research this is especially important given the growing complexity and global nature of clinical studies today we believe this acquisition further solidifies parexels leadership in providing integrated clinical and technology expertise combining the sophisticated in depth capabilities of perceptive and clinphone represents a major step forward for parexel in meeting increased industry demand for a truly comprehensive eclinical platform
4067749 both companies bring tremendous capabilities to this deal as a combined clinical technology company perceptive informatics enables customers to benefit from the efficiency of best in class software and services from one source through the acquisition perceptive has a deeper level of resources as well as a broader range of technical and clinical expertise to drive greater innovation and meet the industrys evolving needs

4067753 ich musste quer bers grundst ck laufen dabei lag das kinderzimmer genau gegen ber vom zimmer der eltern
4067754 statt wenigstens einmal zu duschen schleppte mich miss flodder 15 mal t glich zu
4067755 sie wollte sogar dass die nanny mit ihr und den kindern in einem bett schl ft
4067756 aber als die ersten ger chte aufkamen lie jude mich fallen wie eine hei e kartoffel
4067757 als ozzy ins krankenhaus kam war er total betrunken er brach zusammen und wurde nach hause gefahren ich schickte meine assistentin hinterher die ihn im bett fand mit der nanny die war noch nicht einmal sch n und blond sondern eine h ssliche alte kuh
4067758 w re er n chtern gewesen h tte ichs mir vielleicht anders berlegt
4067759 eine verantwortungsvolle vertrauensw rdige person zu finden ist f r stars noch schwieriger als f r menschen die nicht im rampenlicht stehen
4067760 ich habe nicht gold oder silber verloren sondern bronze gewonnen
4067761 ich wollte bei meinen ersten spielen unbedingt eine medaille jetzt bin ich super happy dass es geklappt hat
4067762 das sch ne an dem stechen war dass jede von uns etwas greifbares sicher hatte
4067763 bei dem regen war es schwer zu schie en ich habe pitschnasse und kalte f e
4067764 die strategie sich abzukapseln war wohl nicht so gut es gab genug extraw rste die letzte ist verbrannt
4067765 der bundestrainer hat hier f nf tage lang kein wort mit mir gesprochen dass er jetzt die schuld auf andere abw lzt ist genau das was ich erwartet habe es ist das letzte dass er jetzt seinen frust an uns abl sst weil sein stuhl wackelt
4067766 doch die arbeit machen die heimtrainer die dann nicht mal erw hnt oder daf r honoriert w rden
4067767 er sucht eine art schmelztiegel oder eine h lle um wieder umgeschmolzen zu werden zu einem anderen menschen auch wenn er dabei draufgeht
4067768 es ist die suche nach einer vernichtung oder einer neuen geburt
4067769 es ging dann immer besser bis wir zum schluss sogar szenen improvisieren konnten
4067770 er kontrollierte was sie a en was sie taten eigentlich alles
4067771 wir hatten keine ahnung ich wusste nicht einmal dass dort kinder leben
4067772 man h tte sich niemals vorstellen k nnen dass er so etwas tun w rde
4067773 if i did have that magic wand in australia i would definitely focus on energy diversity
4067774 i would ask myself do i need to be importing any petroleum at all into this country why would you want to not import petroleum with all the money that flows out of your economy why wouldnt you want to control your own destiny
4067775 i am enviable of australia because i think you are one of the nations that can come truly come up with an energy independence strategy and find a way to reduce the automobiles dependence on petroleum
4067776 i would really go after solar big time in the longer term i really think it is going to be economically viable
4067777 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
4067778 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4067779 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4067780 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
4067781 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
4067782 weve talked to apple weve been told we will have product on our shelves on sept 7 well do the best we can do
4067783 the combination of solid operating performance and improved capital efficiency gave us record earnings this quarter and nearly 5 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the fiscal year
4067784 our underlying business remains sound as our associates deliver on mission to save people money so they can live better
4067785 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4067786 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4067787 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 we estimate the companys comparable store sales increase in the united states to be between one and two percent which continues to reflect some sales volatility from week to week
4067788 we expect the companys earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter to be between 0 73 and 0 76 and are raising our current forecast for earnings from continuing operations for the full fiscal year to a range of 3 43 to 3 50 per share
4067789 lichfield has a lot of talent and hopefully this school will provide a showcase for that talent and give students a chance to work in a professional theatre with experienced tutors
4067790 suggest a need for clearer more consumer friendly terms and conditions
4067791 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
4067792 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
4067793 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
4067794 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
4067795 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
4067796 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
4067797 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4067798 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4067799 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4067800 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4067801 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4067802 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4067803 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4067804 given that china got these games largely on making promises about human rights and press freedom and given that the chinese government has lied through its teeth about keeping those promises is the ioc in any way embarrassed
4067805 of course there are exceptions like in any other country some people are not satisfied that is true
4067806 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details
4067807 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4067808 i did not say that china will promise to do whatever with the games coming to china i did not say that but i say the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better for themselves what china is like
4067809 so you are saying you agreed that china broke its promises
4067810 maar dat zien we niet echt als de nederlandse markt maar meer internationaal
4067811 more than one million other persons whose jobs are linked to the textile industry such as traders and cotton farmers have lost their means of livelihood as a result of the closures presently there are just about 50 000 workers left in the textile sector which used to be the highest employer of labour
4067812 every morning in africa a gazette awakens knowing that it must outrun the fastest lion if it wants to stay alive the lion also wakes up knowing it must run faster than the slowest gazette or it will starve to death it makes no difference whether you are a lion or gazette when the sun comes up you will better be running
4067813 what you are witnessing is a paid for advert by pepsi cola it is part of the companys investment package for hosting the african cup of nations in the country
4067814 a committee was set up to see how best pepsi cola goes about with its adverts in the city of which a member from the department of parks and gardens was included so if the branding exercise was going to have any damage to the trees we would have been told
4067815 a nail can bleed a tree to death if the sap runs out the tree is just like the human being which needs to be protected any external force on it exposes it to danger
4067816 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
4067817 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighboring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
4067818 initiated a genocide probe based on reports of actions committed by georgian troops aimed at murdering russian citizens ethnic ossetians living in south ossetia
4067819 the suit contains material showing that russia has committed ethnic cleansing against georgia during three interventions in south ossetia and abkhazia from 1993 to 2008
4067820 they the u s of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
4067821 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped ten ossetian villages from the face of the earth who used tanks to knock down children and the elderly and who burnt civilians alive they georgian leaders are players who of course have to be protected
4067822 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4067823 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4067824 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4067825 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4067826 the authorities only care about the best kids theres a very elite focus so the base of their pyramid is too narrow

4067990 we have a lot to deliver and need the guidance of a chief executive it is hard to do that in two and a half days a week
4067991 one of the councils will lose out as a result of this
4067992 we are being asked to swallow a buy one get one free offer i have been told that members of the alliance have spoken out about this
4067993 the council should proceed with all speed to search for and appoint a full time interim chief executive
4067994 the real issue for the council is the need for a full time ceo where will the major regeneration schemes be over the next 6 months put on the back burner how can a part time ceo effectively take this authority forward on these regeneration issues
4067995 this six month interim arrangement will provide mutual benefits during this period
4067996 allerdale and carlisle are already working closely together on shared services and we can build on this to benefit our local communities
4067997 this is not an unusual arrangement and a number of local authorities across the country have shared chief executive arrangements and they are all making significant savings and its important that we do that too

4068013 however asbestos was used regularly at the site in the 1950s and the extent of its dangers have only become known fairly recently this has left a legacy for sellafield and the many other industries in which it was commonly used historically

4068026 lennesimo passo verso la costituzione di un mondo multipolare in cui centro e sud america possono avere un peso geopolitico non indifferente per via delle comuni radici ispaniche ma anche per limmensa varieta di culture lintensita di forze innovative progressiste e socialiste al governo di quasi tutti gli stati centro sud americani nonche per le enormi risorse naturali dellarea

4068070 their take up is looking headmost in order to presenting the huckster at the usatf summit adit november
4068071 whenever the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam would intend to go on a journey he would cast lots amongst his wives so whoevers lot would be picked would accompany the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
4068072 so he cast these lots on one of these expeditions and my name came up so i traveled with the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam this was after the verses pertaining to hijab were revealed and therefore i would travel in my hawdaj and be carried in it
4068073 after the expedition had finished and we were returning to madinah the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam gave orders to camp the night outside of madinah
4068074 the women could prepare themselves and the hair that needed to be removed could be removed
4068075 when the orders were given to encamp i stood up and walked away from the army to relieve myself when i returned i felt my chest and lo and behold my onyx necklace had broken and fallen so i returned to where i had been to search for it i was delayed in searching for it and in the meantime the people that were assigned to carry my hawdaj had already placed it on top of the camel presuming that i was back in it
4068076 during those days women were very thin and they had not put on a lot of weight they used to only eat a few morsels of food so the men did not question the lightness of the hawdaj when they picked it up and put it on the camel and on top of that i was a young girl so they sent the camel forward and i found my necklace after they had gone by the time i returned to the caravan camping ground there was not a soul in sight
4068077 on top of that i was a young girl still young in age
4068078 so i stayed in my place and i presumed that they would discover that i was missing and they would return for me while i was waiting in my place sleep got the better of me so i fell asleep
4068079 safwan ibn muaqqal as sulami one of the companions was lagging behind the army for some reason he was late so he was not up with the army and he walked up to my place he saw the shape of a person sleeping and when he saw me he recognized me for he had seen me before the revelation of the verses of the hijab i was woken up by his exclamation of la hawla wa la quwwatta ila billaah when he recognized me so i covered my face with my outer garment
4068080 he recognized her because he had seen her before the verses of hijab had been revealed
4068081 as soon as she saw him she covered her face with her outer garment
4068082 and i swear by allah we did not speak a word to each other nor did i hear any statement from him except la hawla wa la quwwatta illaa billaah he lowered his camel such that i could ride on it and when i mounted the camel he guided it until we caught up with the caravan while they were encamped that is where the rumors started spreading and the people that spread the rumors were destroyed the leader of them was abdullaah ibn ubay ibn salul
4068083 so we arrived in madinah but i fell ill with a fever for a whole month
4068084 after i had been cured i once exited with umm mistah aishas great aunt and the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallams first cousin towards the area that we used to relieve ourselves
4068085 what an evil thing you have said how can you curse a person who has witnessed the battle of badr
4068086 my dear child did you not hear what he is saying about you
4068087 do you give me permission to go to my parents house for i desire to verify the information from them and he agreed
4068088 i asked my mother umm ruman my dear mother what are the people talking about
4068089 my daughter be easy upon yourself by allah it hardly occurs that a wife is so beloved to her husband and she has co wives at the same time except that they talk about her
4068090 i cried that night i cried and cried until the morning came my tears could not stop nor could i taste the sweetness of sleep
4068091 they cannot be guilty they must be innocent they are your wives and we know nothing but good about them
4068092 ya rasulallah allah has not restricted matters upon you and there are plenty of women beside her ask her maidservant she will confirm what she knows about her
4068093 ya barira have you ever seen anything from aisha that will cause you to have doubts about her
4068094 by him who has sent you with the truth i have not seen anything from her what so ever that will cause me to have doubts about her except one thing except that she is a young girl who sometimes falls asleep when she is kneading the dough and when she falls asleep the lamb comes eats the dough and goes away so this is the crime that i know she does
4068095 oh gathering of believers who will excuse me from a person who has hurt me even with regards to my wives whatever i do you have nothing to blame me with now if i were to do anything to this man referring to abdullah ibn ubayy ibn salul then you cannot blame me he has affected me slandered me and he has even reached my wife can anyone blame me for anything i do to him now who will give me an excuse by allah i only know good about my wife and they have mentioned a man with her concerning whom i only know good of as well
4068096 i excuse you ya rasulallah if this person be from among the aws then i will cut his head off and if he be from among my brethren of the khazraj then command us and we will do your bidding
4068097 by allah you have lied you cannot kill him nor are you able to kill him rather had he been from your tribe you would not have liked that he be killed
4068098 saad had been before this incident a righteous man but the tribalism of the jahiliyyah overtook him
4068099 rather you are the liar and we will surely kill him you are only a hypocrite defending the other hypocrite
4068100 so i continued to cry that day and my tears would not stop flowing until i believed that my liver would split open due to my tears while i was sitting and crying my parents were with me and one of the ansar ladies asked permission to enter and started crying with me
4068101 while we were in that state the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam entered upon us said salam and sat down
4068102 stopped crying until she could not even feel a single tear in her eyes
4068103 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam on my behalf answer him say something
4068104 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam say something tell him i didnt do this
4068105 what can i say to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
4068106 i was still a young girl at that time and had not memorized much of the quran so i could not remember the name of the father of yusuf
4068107 i know by allah that you have heard these rumors and that these rumors have settled in your heart and soul and you have believed it already so if i were to tell you that im not guilty you wouldnt believe me and if i were to admit to a crime that i did not commit then you will believe me and think that i did it so all i can say to you is what the father of yusuf said patience is beautiful and allah subhaanahu wa taaalas help is sought concerning what you describe
4068108 i turned around on my bed allah knew i was innocent of this charge and i knew that allah would reveal my innocence however wallahi i never thought that allah would reveal quran concerning me i thought myself far too low in the sight of allah that allah would speak about me rather i was hoping that the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam might see in his dream something that would declare my innocence
4068109 when the revelation finished the prophet sal alaahu alayhi wa sallam started laughing out of happiness
4068110 so my mother stood up and told me stand up to thank the prophet sal allahu alayhi wa sallam
4068111 no by allah i will not stand up to him rather i will thank allah subhaanahu wa taaala
4068112 wallahi i will never give a single penny to mistah as long as i live
4068113 balaa yes of course i wish that allah forgives me wallahi i will never stop paying mistah as long as i live
4068114 the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam had already asked zainab ibn jahsh about me and she was my main rival from amongst the prophets wives
4068115 so allah saved her because of her piety but her sister hamana thought she was fighting on her behalf by spreading the slander so she was destroyed along with those that were destroyed
4068116 and the man they had accused safwan ibn muaqqil when the rumors were going on he would say subhan allah by him in whose hands is my soul i have never raised the veil of any woman in my life for at that time he had not yet been married

4068147 its a sheer coincidence that my crucial bout coincides with indias independence day im someone whos very emotional about my country and i have to rise to the occasion
4068148 its quite a possibility in other events already a number of world champions and medallists have bitten the dust i just want to continue with the trend
4068149 being the senior most member its only natural that you would help the juniors jitender specially is very fond of me and in fact both of us have a similar style to be honest im banking more on him to win a medal hes young faster and even stronger than me the only thing he lacks is experience otherwise he would have been a sure shot for a medal here
4068150 ive set the goal high for myself and thinking only about gold nothing less representing the country in olympics is a dream and i want a fairytale end to it

4068168 het wordt door internet steeds gemakkelijker om een groot professioneel netwerk te onderhouden dit netwerk heeft waarde in allerlei markten ook in de arbeidsmarkt vriendendiensten bestaan al lang maar door internet wordt hun aantal veel groter een goede verkoper solliciteert meestal niet maar wordt benaderd voor nieuwe uitdagingen deze trend gaat ook steeds meer op bij andere functiegebieden zoals marketing communicatie ict en consultancy sommige bedrijven halen al meer dan 30 van hun nieuwe medewerkers uit het eigen netwerk dit zijn dus mensen die via via op een functie worden aangenomen als je weet dat een goede bekende misschien ook wel eens wat anders wil en je tips hem of haar over een voor hem of haar leuke job dan kan hij of zij van passief werkzoekende ineens actief werkzoekend worden dit is het grootste voordeel van social recruitment ten opzichte van traditionele vacaturebanken waar alleen mensen komen die al actief naar werk op zoek zijn en in de huidige krappe arbeidsmarkt zijn sowieso niet zoveel mensen actief op zoek het verschil met een werving amp selectiebureau is dat een werkgever voor veel lagere kosten kan werven de hoogte van de premie bepaalt het bedrijf helemaal zelf het bedrijf zal nog wel de selectie zelf moeten doen gespecialiseerde werving amp selectiebureaus kunnen friendhunter ook gebruiken voor leadgeneratie en vervolgens voor hun klanten alsnog de selectie van de geschikte kandidaat voor hun rekening nemen ik verwacht dat 2008 het jaar wordt van de doorbraak van social recruitment in nederland in belgi zijn inmiddels succesvolle initiatieven gestart wat friendhunter anders doet dan haar nederlandse en internationale concurrenten is nadrukkelijk samenwerken met partners voor de distributie van vacatures met partners als dagbanen startlog en professionele weblogs zoals marketingfacts en frankwatching kunnen vacatures getarget worden tot in de haarvaten van de arbeidsmarkt
4068169 bedrijven kunnen zich kosteloos registreren op friendhunter en als ze akkoord gaan met de algemene voorwaarden meteen vacatures plaatsen netwerkers kunnen een zoekprofiel aanmaken waardoor niet alle vacatures worden doorgestuurd maar alleen de selectie die zij interessant en relevant vinden friendhunter heeft een uitgebreide e mail rss ondersteuning die je zelf kunt instellen waardoor netwerkers alerts krijgen van relevante vacatures en van de status van hun bemiddelingen bovendien kunnen netwerkers een widget aanmaken voor op de eigen website of weblog friendhunter stap voor stap uitgelegd recruiters worden op de hoogte gehouden als kandidaten zich aanmelden als een kandidaat in het proces zit ontvangt de recruiter berichten met de vraag naar de status van de kandidaat in het sollicitatieproces vanuit de e mail kan de status meteen worden veranderd zodat de recruiter niet zelf hoeft te bewaken dat hij naar de website moet om wijzigingen door te voeren zodra er een match is ontvangt het bedrijf een betalingsopdracht en wordt de netwerker op de hoogte gesteld dat hij of zij 50 van de premie zal ontvangen bij de start van de nieuwe baan van zijn of haar relatie de andere 50 wordt overgemaakt als de medewerker na n maand nog steeds bij het bedrijf werkt de inkomsten zal de netwerker zelf moeten aangeven voor de inkomstenbelastingen voor bedrijven is van belang dat de belastingdienst heeft bevestigd dat ze zich geen zorgen hoeven te maken dat de betalingen aan netwerkers worden gezien als loon uit werken
4068170 een eerste groep bedrijven kreeg in de afgelopen weken al de mogelijkheid om een account aan te maken en vacatures in te voeren vanaf vandaag komt friendhunter ook beschikbaar voor netwerkers de komende weken sluiten verschillende partners zich aan waardoor het bereik direct vergroot wordt door deze aanpak worden adverteerders uit verschillende branches gekoppeld aan een uiteenlopende verzameling netwerken en netwerkers friendhunter kan doordat sollicitatieprocessen via de database worden gemonitord een uitstekende benchmark opbouwen als het gaat om vragen als hoeveel procent van de vacatures worden vervuld welke functies krijgen de meeste kandidaten en hoe lang loopt een sollicitatietraject
4068171 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4068172 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4068173 independent democrat and fervent mccain supporter who is also pro choice likely wouldnt fare well with many conservatives either

4068257 common ground moving the conversation beyond the question of the legality of abortion and move towards sic actually reducing the need for abortion by investing in programs that will reduce both unintended pregnancies and abortions
4068258 this all sounds very nice and im sure its well intentioned but it uses right wing frames to build the discussion then appeals to a center ground thats actually skewed pretty badly
4068259 the only reason to refer to abortion on demand is to depict it as unnecessary an elective procedure like plastic surgery
4068260 and why precisely do we have a moral obligation to find common ground i suppose to help women and families make other choices
4068261 and we have to split the difference with them why
4068262 t he only way to make sense of the argument as hes framed it is to assume that abortion is a moral bad and that women need to be guided away from them sic
4068263 the strategic mistake here is to assume that the conservative interest is in reducing abortion its not thats only a positive result of the real interest which is in regulating womens sexuality
4068264 adultery is a violation of biblical instruction as well as an offense against the other partner in what should be a sacred relationship furthermore the breach of faith is disastrous to children as well as the broader society

4068315 of our own doing a crisis of governance man made with ignorance greed and corruption at its core but the worst of them is corruption
4068316 without increased advocacy to stop corruption in water there will be high costs to economic and human development the destruction of vital ecosystems and the fuelling of social tension or even conflict over this essential resource
4068317 corruption in the water sector is widespread and makes water undrinkable inaccessible and unaffordable it is evident in the drilling of rural wells in sub saharan africa the construction of water treatment facilities in asias urban areas the building of hydroelectric dams in latin america and the daily abuse and misuse of water resources around the world

4068319 we are thrilled with the strength of our field this year not only do we have the top 15 on the money list but we also have 28 of the top 30 here as well
4068320 it is a tribute to our long history with the lpga the commitment of safeway to the tour and the players love for playing at columbia edgewater country club
4068321 im really grateful i didnt have to make four picks this morning
4068322 i can assure you it would have been very difficult and honestly i wouldnt know what to do if i had to sit back right now and say these are the four guys i could have gotten burned by it because theres three weeks remaining after this tournament before i get to pick hopefully the four picks will fall right in my lap and it will be obvious i dont think it will be that way and i think picking four guys will be difficult
4068323 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
4068324 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences
4068325 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that
4068326 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
4068327 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis is a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality
4068328 this has been a goal of mine for about nine years and its taken a little longer for me to reach it than id like but now that im back on the team ive certainly played a couple but i feel like im going to bring a little bit of not quite youth but you know maybe a little perspective on it that some of the other guys may not have
4068329 im looking forward to getting back to that there are some great memories because of the success that we had on sunday but theres nothing like those butterflies on the first tee of your first match in a ryder cup theres nothing like it
4068330 it was pretty heavy i mean after that morning round of finishing up i really was just like weve got to go out and play some good golf
4068331 we have got to show them that we want to be a part of it and that we can play under pressure and that we can play against all odds you know youre out there playing 36 holes or 30 holes however many holes you played it shows that hey you know youve got the backbone to go out there and do it and i wanted to prove it and i know i could
4068332 in the end theres no super motivational speech you can give to a guy who is playing poorly to get him to play better
4068333 and ive said all along i dont think i can say anything stupid enough to screw a guy up who is playing well so well see how that plays out i think the selection process has worked so far
4068334 im really excited about who we have on the team the next three weeks are going to be really important for the remainder of the pga tour because as i look at it right now anybody can get on this team
4068335 im really looking forward to playing in one of the flagship events of the european seniors tour and it always adds something special when youre competing with friends at a great venue

4068340 usually we bring you press guys in to show you the things that were cutting because we dont have enough money
4068341 i just feel like how do you not be moved by this story
4068342 i have read articles in the past about people whove had hardships you always feel that the other person will do it
4068343 i just felt like today was the right day for me to do it
4068344 i read the daily news every day and stories like this just kill me
4068345 i used to live in a shelter and we didnt have anything like that
4068346 you know youre reading it and you realize it could have happened to anybody in the neighborhood
4068347 i was always proud to say i was from the northeast
4068348 those things didnt happen when i grew up back then the neighborhood pitched in thats what you did
4068349 during their vacations from school they sell candy in the streets i know its risky because of what they are exposed to but do you think this is really my choice faced with the cost of living
4068350 before i cooked every day but now i cook once every three days it has been so long since we have seen any meat on our plates
4068351 i have forbidden my family from eating rice and bread
4068352 in my opinion these are not essential to their survival
4068353 the lifting of long standing fuel subsidies by the government in february 2008 has certainly worsened inflation
4068354 this increase helped the poorest of the poor subsisting in precarious living conditions but for those who are not at that level this change had little impact in reversing the government salary cuts of 1993 which in real terms is a 70 percent cut after the devaluation of the cfa franc west african currency in 1994
4068355 the less people are able to afford with what they make the more people who will enter the informal economy
4068356 these companies operate clandestinely do not pay taxes or provide any social security to their workers
4068357 i am interested in hiv positive men whether they are on treatment or not but they must be in good shape and ambitious like me
4068358 when theres two of you its always much easier to face the illness and share your fears
4068359 constant and increasing requests from the sick people that we monitor
4068360 what i am most proud of is that six months ago i managed to get two couples together
4068361 the two of them are really blooming and they also plan to formalise their relationship
4068362 this is not at all surprising because on the one hand there are more hiv positive women than men in cameroon and on the other male patients on the whole dont like making themselves known
4068363 our involvement is limited to advice particularly on the use of condoms during sexual relations and on the precautions to take if the couple want to have a baby
4068364 losing all will to continue with the treatment and develops habits to compensate such as alcoholism cigarettes or drug abuse which damage their health
4068365 i had to put an end to the relationship because my partner was very unfaithful and did not want to have protected sex
4068366 there is a risk of self marginalisation people who are scared of their status being revealed and or expect to be stigmatised by others and avoid relationships with hiv negative people or those who are undiagnosed
4068367 contribute to creating or bringing about low self esteem a lack of confidence in themselves and in their ability to develop emotional relationships with others whatever their hiv status
4068368 beyond the role of providing food to facilitating access to food for some years now
4068369 this strategic plan marks a revolution in food aid that supports local markets in breaking the cycle of hunger
4068370 this is not your grandmothers food aid and just in time
4068371 the global situation reaffirms the fact that the wfp was and is headed in the right direction
4068372 our entry point will continue to be a response to emergencies
4068373 we are also looking at eradicating the root cause of hunger
4068374 with this new plan in a sense they are trying to broaden their tools to implement the remaining 20 percent of their commitment to development
4068375 eighty percent of our cash for food is spent in the developing world 80 percent of our ground transport is procured in the developing world and 80 percent of our staff is hired locally in the developing world
4068376 while wfp was initially created to dispose of food surpluses from developed countries the programme seems to be now ready to evolve in order to respond to hunger more effectively
4068377 an essential direction to make food aid support local agriculture and markets rather than undermine them as it has been the case in the past when food aid was part of the market development agenda of donor countries
4068378 several of these initiatives have been piloted in countries over the years
4068379 in many regions climate change contributes to the destruction of livelihoods reduces agricultural yields and threatens lives pushing ever more people into desperation
4068380 responding to those hunger challenges requires multi faceted food assistance policies that can address food availability food access and food utilisation problems
4068381 we think this new plan should not necessarily translate into more activities for wfp but rather better quality and effectiveness of wfps work
4068382 this evolution especially in the current context of global food crisis should also encourage donors to broaden their approach to hunger and fund more comprehensive interventions than just emergency food aid using a wider range of instruments supporting local capacities for the establishment of safety nets and the enhancement of peoples resilience

4068386 we can get access within a week and historically have seen a willingness on the part of ministers to engage with us in debate
4068387 its not to say that they give in on every occasion but historically we have seen a willingness to discuss our problems and that is a great benefit
4068388 devolution has allowed us better access to and consultation with politicians and decision makers
4068389 of course the industry still has a seemingly endless stream of problems to tackle but when you have worked with defra on issues you realise how lucky we are to have the assembly
4068390 a key move for wales was the adoption of the historic single payment model which was advocated by the industry and has minimised disruption to the support system the problems still being experienced in england because of their single payment model are not to be envied
4068391 the governance of wales has been much more open to the needs of rural wales in contrast to england and is envied as such
4068392 the downside is that we inherited the minority share of the pot we had before the main share of the cap having gone to the arable areas of england while wales is mostly livestock this has limited the ability to deliver previously we were able to knock on doors in westminster when there was a financial shortfall now we have to rely on the welsh assembly
4068393 theyve had great difficulty and i think there are some farmers who still havent resolved the issues of single payment from 2005
4068394 the welsh payments have been resolved but certainly where you have complicated businesses there are some land issues that are still being disputed between the rpa and the farmer theyre still having delays in their payments and whereas the majority of my farmers would have been paid in early december cross border people are waiting well into the new year to receive payments
4068395 i feel basically that wales is going the right way
4068396 i am pleased for them and wish that england was doing something similar and that our cap payments were more fairly distributed
4068397 we seem to have been forgotten on this side of the border the single farm payment system is moving against the family farm in favour of larger farms and institutional farms we have been forced away from the historic basis to the hectarage basis
4068398 we havent got the hectares but we did have the stock in west herefordshire we have hill livestock farms that are certainly comparable if not more severely disadvantaged and yet we are now at a financial disadvantage
4068399 council taxes have gone up consistently ahead of inflation in wales
4068400 with the assembly drawing an extra 12 as a result of property rebanding in 2005 something england abandoned there do not seem to be many tangible benefits which can be attributed directly to devolution
4068401 many rural communities now face the loss of their schools post offices and pubs and our planning system is slower than ever where is the money going
4068402 ive learned that i wont please everyone all the time but if i can prove to people that ill give everybody a hearing and whatever i do will always be with the over riding interest of being of benefit to rural wales
4068403 theres far less security about global food supplies because of competing markets and in wales we need to be producing food

4068726 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4068727 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4068728 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4068730 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4068731 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4068732 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4068733 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

4068737 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4068738 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4068739 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4068740 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4068741 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4068742 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4068766 imtech is met heel veel activiteiten actief in een aantal marktsegmenten die daar bijna ongevoelig voor zijn zoals zorg veiligheid en de olie en gasindustrie
4068767 eenderde van imtech is wel gerelateerd aan bouw maar dat zijn onder andere ziekenhuis stadion en overheidsprojecten daar gelden andere budgetgelden dan in de normale bouw
4068768 dat is nu niet het geval we kunnen ook niet zeggen wanneer we dat eventueel kunnen gaan voelen op dit moment merken we er ten opzichte van onze orderportefeuille in ieder geval helemaal niks van
4068769 op dit moment hebben we een longlist van circa 25 a 30 bedrijven we kijken meer naar kleinere en middelgrote bedrijven dan naar hele grote partijen om over te nemen

4068777 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres
4068778 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
4068779 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
4068780 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa status of forces agreement ever that the us has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding

4068782 for an athlete joy and happiness is temporary most of the time you have to be doing painful training
4068783 sometimes i would get really hungry but i was only allowed to drink water i would tell myself to hold on until after the olympics
4068784 a gold might have been a tad bit unrealistic for us
4068785 im not really disappointed im just sad about it because before high bar i knew if i could just do the routine it was second place
4068786 i cant really tell why that happened i just tried to do the first flying element very soon near to the bar then i missed the bar with one hand and i couldnt hold it boom i just went down
4068787 the ones who are playing are in the water and theyre going to do a good job for sure im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4068788 when i was doing a little more than i was supposed to they said ok you cant stay here youve got to go its ridiculous but whatever
4068789 thats something i cant stand im not going to just close my eyes to that

4068807 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4068808 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
4068809 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games
4068810 any team that can win their groups at the olympics are quite strong these teams are basically chinas primary opponents
4068811 maybe overall china is stronger but on an individual basis theyve beaten us before in singles matches or other contests

4068826 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4068827 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4068828 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4068831 i went towards the rear of the train a bloke come towards me he informed me the people in the third carriage were dead
4068832 all of a sudden i saw the truck hit everything just went everywhere
4068833 the front of the truck flew up into the air then i saw the carriage of the train coming past opened up like a tin
4068834 he was trying his hardest to get off the road he told the court
4068835 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal

4068843 shore up the employment based system not tear it down lower premiums that firms face through investments in information technology and prevention create a setting where individuals and small firms can buy insurance the way that large firms do make sure that insurers cannot exclude firms because one employee is sick
4068844 simply aims to bring equity and choice to our health care system including allowing american families to keep their current coverage
4068845 the mccain plan gives american families a 5 000 refundable tax credit 2 500 for individuals to give them more choices to purchase portable coverage that would stay with them from job to job or job to home his plan directly and comprehensively addresses the single biggest threat

4068850 called for a sweeping overhaul of the department of veterans affairs benefits claims program
4068851 proposes one solution item that obama has not yet mentioned
4068852 veteran with an injury or illness incurred during military service could use to get free treatment at a local hospital if the va hospital is too far away
4068853 there is one idea i have urged that mccain nor obama have not
4068854 lets rename the va the department of veterans advocacy and let the new va take the lead in providing each veteran with the benefits and care they have earned
4068855 need to start addressing the issue of long term care
4068856 of vital importance for people with disabilities and our families and friends
4068857 federal long term care policy still heavily favors institutionalization countless people with disabilities are forced to give up their freedom in exchange for assistance
4068858 obama nor mccain lists long term care as an issue on their main web pages
4068859 obama does have a nine page platform addressing disability issues
4068860 support of a major piece of proposed legislation that would make it much easier for people to receive medicaid funded assistance in their homes
4068861 it is somewhat overwhelming first of all youre in a country where they dont speak the language there are a lot of people it is a very crowded city but it works
4068862 lets all forget about wars lets all celebrate joys and humanity and all of that stuff but at the same time the restrictions placed on who can and cannot be an athlete what nation you represent means that the olympics are always wonderful and horrible at exactly the same time
4068863 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4068864 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4068865 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4068866 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4068867 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4068868 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4068869 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4068870 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4068871 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene

4068878 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4068879 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4068880 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important

4068887 its very satisfying to see the players willingness to stay
4068888 the club will not do anything crazy or break our financial and sporting guidelines so we have gone as far as we have been able to
4068889 there is complete agreement between the club and the player david jimenez silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons
4068890 we have always expressed the hope that he will stay with us
4068891 we were not playing well the only positive thing you can take is that we didnt concede a goal we know we have to win at anfield and have confidence we can we will have had more games and more players there were a lot of things that we were not doing well and everyone is upset that it was a bad performance
4068892 i think we were lucky not to concede you never know what is going to happen when a game gets underway but clearly we didnt play well the performance was poor but the result was good we didnt concede away from home which is always important and to play the second leg at anfield could make a massive difference
4068893 we didnt have to say too much about the display in the dressing room because everybody already knew it wasnt good i was a little bit surprised because we were playing well in pre season with a lot of confidence but this game was different it was difficult and i think the entire team didnt play well the strikers midfielders and defenders didnt play well and pepe reina was man of the match
4068894 they were very aggressive and we could not keep the ball our passes were bad and we always lost the first and second ball in the first 20 minutes they were on top of us and after that we controlled it a bit more in the second half they started the same way and played more long balls and continued to win the first and second balls and if you dont win them you will continue to be under pressure
4068895 i told the players before after watching their super cup game against anderlecht that it could be like this we knew they could be very aggressive they were organised and pressed well and it was difficult for us to keep the ball
4068896 we have a lot of players away or injured and the competition for the places needs to improve gerrard couldnt start and he is a player who can change a game and if you have two or three players of this level on the pitch it is different we were talking with the doctor before the match and we knew he couldnt start and we were thinking maybe we could use him and in the end we did need him
4068897 fabio aurelio and skrtel have been training and when they are available we will have more options argentina play holland in the olympics too so one player will return earlier if you have more players competing for places it is better for the team
4068898 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will be much harder for us we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem but i want to praise my team they attacked liverpool from the start and when their goalkeeper pulled the ball back from behind the line maybe the referee was asleep too
4068899 say the principle reason is that they are seldom sick
4068900 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances

4068907 truly one of the majors in the first wave of important players recently to emerge out of baltimore
4068908 like dan deacon and the wham city crew ponytail are finding ways to take the concerns of childhood and channel them into deceptively sophisticated music
4068909 with a gazillion ideas snapped together like so many legos ponytails second album is an exhilarating puzzle
4068910 a fresh and kinetic post post rock quartet from baltimore ponytail is a little boredoms a little deerhoof a little captain beefhearts magic band
4068911 ponytails trad punk rock four piece setup felt downright refreshing like scouring your brain with a pumice stone chaos threatened at every zinging riff and bashed cymbal but the tension came from the stop on a dime precision with which the band beat the shit out of its instruments vocalist molly siegel is no bigger than a thimble and has one of those big little voices that bug you out from the moment she ambles onstage
4068912 like an unexpected fist in the face from a five year old ponytails boisterous pop punk jams are saved from saccharine overkill with some unexpectedly tight hooks plus a paradoxical feathery lightness of touch that makes their music feel orgasmically flush even at its churningest and most densely impenetrable
4068913 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
4068914 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
4068915 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons re learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment

4068920 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4068921 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
4068922 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
4068923 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4068924 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4068925 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4068926 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4068927 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4068928 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4068929 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4068930 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4068931 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4068932 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4068933 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4068934 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4068935 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important

4068938 i am not a producer so i definitely know nothing about singing and songs
4068939 i believe that playback lip synching is something that is used in the music industry and the entertainment and show industry on a regular basis but frankly speaking this is rather insignificant in relation to the complexity of the games and the magnitude of the games
4068940 looking forward the technically oversoldcondition might spur further upside forgold for today and tomorrow
4068941 i think the lower price has attracted buyers into the market given the extreme volatility of the gold price in recent days i think picking the near term direction is very difficult

4068953 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4068954 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

4068963 we want to be on the front foot in terms of our preparation for the season having hugh with warriors to assist us in that process for every match will be very extremely productive

4069006 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4069007 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4069008 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4069009 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4069011 premier league clubs and players do so much to inspire and excite generally fans and the media are talking about the great goals and moments of skill in the barclays premier league
4069012 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating their decisions in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone fans included
4069013 our message is clear and straightforward it comes with one voice from the chairmen managers and the players lets get on with the game
4069014 nothing it can be proposed in the committee in the plenary
4069015 the house is in agreement to sit down with the senate to discuss charter change we will listen to them they should also listen if house members bring up other matters such as the parliamentary form
4069016 we in the committee have agreed that in the next meeting we will vote on whether to push through or not hopefully we can also come up with a decision on what mode to prefer
4069017 i believe they have bad intentions in supporting senate resolution no 10 but withdrawing my signature does not mean i am not in support of the concept of federalism i am just worried that malaca ang is clearly riding on this to raise the term limits
4069018 i think most of the senators who signed if not all will have to rethink their position if this will open the floodgates to the extension of the presidents term limits a lot of senators will change their positions
4069019 term extension is not in our radar it is only the media and some people who dislike the president who are saying that
4069020 the president will not turn her back on what she said that she will step down in 2010
4069021 lets just wait for the truth to happen we are blinded with bias
4069022 all that she is saying is that there is a resolution therefore lets find out how things will be
4069023 its all part of news management that cha cha has become more important than the moa and to think that cha cha is doomed to fail anyway
4069024 i believe this proposition is right and i will support it even if an evil person endorses it
4069025 as important as the moa could only be drafted and agreed upon if the terms of the same are negotiated under the democratic requirements of absolute transparency and full consultation involving all stakeholders
4069026 no amount of charter change however large the scale of public approval will ever make it right
4069027 heck if all but one filipino were to vote to give away a part of our country so that it becomes a separate country they would all be wrong and a singular voice opposing it would be right
4069028 god damn the bastards who want to give away part of our country just to keep a grip on what remains

4069032 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4069033 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4069034 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4069035 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4069045 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
4069046 this is not the time to do business with iran
4069047 it is time for the international community including our ally turkey to begin considering additional measures to pressure iran
4069048 increased tensions be tween iran and the us will put turkey in a very awkward position
4069049 after the iraq war turkey learned it could no longer remain indifferent to regional developments

4069067 there was a huge blues scene in milwaukee but it has somewhat died down
4069068 but when we play at the up and under there are a lot of young people who come to see us and were just trying to spread that around i think right now were on the rebuilding stages
4069069 our sound is definitely blues but also roots music we incorporate a lot of rock too not classic rock but early 1950s style rock that you can dance to and has a lot of feeling
4069070 were certainly a blues band but we have different feels and quite a bit of range we even do some old country
4069071 we do a couple rockabilly or honky tonk numbers its blues but its more of an americana thing
4069072 we play maybe 30 or 40 songs in every show we have a lot of new stuff but we play our first album obviously too we do some covers but they are mostly old obscure blues tunes that we really make our own
4069073 when we released our album we had a lot of airplay across the country and in europe
4069074 but at the time we werent ready to tour to those places and so we are now just getting geared up to travel
4069075 we are planning to release a new album this winter
4069076 individually weve worked on a national level and weve started to get a few sniffs around for shows
4069077 its mainly the others who have played with some big heavy hitters every time you play with someone different its a good learning experience
4069078 and especially if you play with some of the big shots and they give you the nod of appreciation it helps you become a better performer it tells you that youre doing something right
4069079 the four of us have been working as professional musicians for awhile now and thats the biggest difference between us and most local blues bands
4069080 we are truly ecstatic to have canary central naxos amp seacon tower and discovery dock apartments in our prestigious london serviced apartments list we are confident that discerning travelers coming to london for pleasure or business trip will find their stay incredible in these serviced apartments with undisputed range of facilities apartotels com thirsts to mark a name for itself in travel industry and make traveling a pleasing experience
4069081 the decline in consumer confidence is likely to have a knock on effect for the hotel industry
4069082 the last recession was characterised by an initial decline in occupancy rates followed by a fall in room rates hoteliers need to consider how they will respond if consumer spending tightens further the inclination in tough times is to respond by cutting prices however once average room rates fall it becomes difficult to move them back up
4069083 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4069084 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4069085 so you try to make sure that they know that youre intelligent and not horrible then you try to be rugged and sexy but only after smart and lovable
4069086 a friend of mine once said god the things you say
4069087 i thought imagine the things i dont say you cant possibly imagine what its like to actually live inside this head
4069088 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4069089 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4069090 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4069091 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4069092 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4069093 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4069094 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4069095 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4069096 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4069097 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4069098 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4069099 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4069100 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4069101 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4069102 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4069103 it is understood that president mugabe and mutambara subsequently agreed on these issues paving the way for mugabe to form a new government and for the seventh parliament to start sitting following elections held earlier in the year
4069104 tsvangirai would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4069105 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
4069106 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
4069107 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4069108 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4069109 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4069110 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4069123 my husband and i had a destination wedding in georgetown grand cayman
4069124 we took a cruise and invited our friends and family to join us being our wedding this wasnt just a vacation for us but a very special turning point in our lives i used a local travel agent because i like the idea of booking our trip with someone i could meet with and speak with and physically see i was apprehensive about online travel reservations for such an important event my travel agent was very pleasant and seemed to know what she was doing unfortunately we had a mishap regarding our flights we didnt have any so three months before our wedding i had a group of 20 people who needed to get to florida during school vacation needless to say i panicked luckily we all got flights paid a little more than planned but also learned a valuable lesson
4069125 i decided to start a travel agency that focused on the little things and made planning a vacation more enjoyable
4069126 there are always surprises that arise when making travel plans i try to handle them without a lot of stress and aggravation i think it is important to have someone on your side advocating for you if youve ever had to call an airline with a mistake or change in your travel plans then you know what im talking about
4069127 im not saying its impossible but i dont think it will happen
4069128 washburn came and asked me can you tell me who claimed me
4069129 i dont know anything about that i havent heard anything like that i gotta believe this time of year a lot of guys are placed on waivers a lot of guys get claimed i think thats probably pretty routine
4069130 you gotta hope whatever happens its for the best of the organization and best for all of us

4069147 der begriff des krieges ist aus der sprache des v lkerrechts weitgehend verdr ngt

4069149 the two presidents agreed on the resumption of the work of the to define and draw the syrian lebanese borders
4069150 the definition of the shebaa farms cannot happen under occupation
4069151 as the president of a country with the people of that country we went to the international community to say yes we agree with the judgement
4069152 the signing of the agreement was witnessed by the secretary general of the united nations and today we say we are not giving it to cameroun ask yourself the question what do we stand to gain and what do we stand to lose as a nation are we going to be taken seriously
4069153 dont forget we are talking about an area an area of which over 80 per cent is already in the hands of cameroun over 80 of the area has been handed over to cameroun already by the last government yes they cameroun have taken over they built their schools they have built health centres they have built their police station everything is there in fact nigerians in the rest part that have not been ceded are even taking their children to school there
4069154 as a people this is the river this is the bakassi this is nigeria it is possible for nigeria to replicate bakassi this side this is nigerian land this is cross river state this is already carved to cross river state you can replicate bakassi here
4069155 and of course as a nigerian if you have a house there it is not compulsory you have to live there and if you have to live there there are rules that would make you to stay there
4069156 so the agreement stands if you listen to the former attorney general of the federation he said the agreement was signed long long ago bakassi was never part of nigeria he said so ive not seen the agreement but he said so and of course as a former attorney general you cannot say the man is drunk
4069157 thats one aspect i want to come in im not a lawyer but can a federal high court federal high court of a nation decide over an international court of justice its like say a federal high court can decide over a decision of a supreme court of nigeria can a federal high court decide over the highest court of the world this is to say that there is no activity that can take place if the federal high court of any country can take a decision
4069158 this is a human oriented government the president will not disappoint them and nigerians he swore to the constitution of nigeria to protect the lives of nigerians and mr president will do everything to ensure that nigerians are not abandoned
4069159 and its to that level that he has given directives to a local committee which is chaired by the governor of cross river state to ensure that everything is put in place to accommodate those people that are coming over as at the 14th and of course the technical committee and the federal government that is chaired by the cross river state governor we are also doing our statutory roles
4069160 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4069161 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4069162 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4069163 it is easier to recycle paper as there is no fiddling undoing staples it saves time not having to reload the stapler and also money not having to buy them

4069167 chi sta bene con s stesso sta meglio anche con gli altri
4069168 our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
4069169 take the necessary measures to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws
4069170 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4069171 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4069172 i do not say to you seven times but seventy times seven

4069176 olanrewaju is one of our strong boxers he never gives up but look at the way he lost today he couldnt meet up with the speed of the cuban the cuban was sharper it was so because the cuban has competed in many aiba competitions he trained well and got exposed in many competitions all we hear in nigeria is that theres no money for competitions what we do in nigeria is like going to church every sunday without fellowshipping or doing the right things we trained for three months in benin without a competition not a local one not even going to benin republic or togo it is wrong if you go for competitions you learn and you get better exposure is not about going for training tour only if you dont compete you cannot assess yourself simple we checked the profile of the cuban and found out he has been in all competitions since he was 17 thats the guy who fought a nigerian whose only competition was the qualifier in namibia last year what we are doing is like teaching a student without setting exams for him how would you know if he is learning well the cuban won because he was avoiding our boxer he knew the tricks our boxer didnt know it is painful because in the past we did all these things peter koyengwachi nojim maiyegun ikhouria myself and some others were products of the old system but when you talk now they will say you want trips because of money in my time i travelled a lot i have been to many countries if i didnt make money then is it now that ill make money it is not about one making money it is about nigeria spending money to get results we are not doing that and this is why we are getting this type of result
4069177 do you know that ghana went to cuba for one and half months training and competing to prepare for the olympics if they get results will you be surprised
4069178 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4069179 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4069180 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4069181 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4069182 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4069183 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4069184 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4069185 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4069186 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4069187 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4069188 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4069189 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4069190 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4069191 google a t il un penchant pour les antis mites
4069192 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4069193 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4069194 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
4069195 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
4069196 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring
4069197 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
4069198 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
4069199 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
4069200 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
4069201 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
4069202 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance
4069203 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4069204 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
4069205 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
4069206 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4069207 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4069208 defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
4069209 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
4069210 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
4069211 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
4069212 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us

4069215 observers estimate that this year alone people will buy 32million digital televisions the old televisions will then get dumped in countries such as ghana
4069216 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are junk they just dont work they are obsolete not functional and they contain an array of toxic materials including lead mercury and brominated flame retardants and they are destined for disposal in their countries of origin but they are sent here where only about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to the agbogbloshie dump site and other dump sites around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams this is simply dumping and nothing more

4069224 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person in a more positive light i got some great clothes from alexander wang and i miss samantha ronson cuz shes out of town have a wonderful day everyone till next time xx ll

4069227 the us communications industry has proven to be resilient during difficult economic periods over the last several decades because of the diverse portfolio of spending derived from the institutional consumer advertising and marketing sectors

4069309 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages

4069325 it was a great finish from quincy and he proved in the time he had on the pitch that he has got plenty of skill and pace
4069326 hes a very lively player and will be even better once we get him fit to play 90 minutes i think hes a guy who wants to make a name for himself and certainly talking to him he wants to be a star at birmingham
4069327 im sure with the right guidance and good people around him marcus bent kevin phillips lee carsley we can help quincy mature into an excellent professional
4069328 i would love to have a very good cup run to get to the farther reaches of the carling cup would be brilliant i got to a cup final with hibs so there is no reason why we cant believe we can do it here at birmingham the main priority of course is to get back to the premier league
4069329 ago is doing very well it was just a little niggle so he should pull up fine

4069347 mac daily news was one of many apple followers to note that apple inc
4069348 i think for the amount of time hes been here we can only be delighted with his contribution ive seen him play before and it was almost like a seamless transition
4069349 he looked like hed played with the boys roundabout him before he picked up good positions and we knew he was going to add pace to us and that would give us a bigger threat he was a little bit ill over the weekend as well and hes not 100 so thats quite appetising isnt it
4069350 i had two good years under kevin at fulham he signed me from blackburn and in our first season we lost in the play offs and then won the league the year after by a country mile
4069351 we had nearly 10 000 in the ground and that was on the back of a big crowd for the game against norwich at the weekend

4069371 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4069372 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4069373 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4069374 are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4069375 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area the world is watching and the ioc is appraising
4069376 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4069377 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4069378 but there are a few people who have come here to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4069379 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4069380 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that he said
4069381 i think the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better what china is about

4069386 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4069387 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4069388 at this time we assume the event will go forward as planned

4069398 despite the doom and gloom messages we are hearing on a daily basis at mayflex it is business as normal we have filled a need to recruit in areas that we feel we will have greatest impact in the coming months and we are already beginning to see the benefits of having such a diverse and knowledgeable team of people on board this will contribute greatly to the continued success and growth of our business moving forward
4069399 we set up the ip security division two years ago and in that time we have seen considerable growth and activity in this area mayflex is fast becoming a strong contender in this sector of the market as greater demand for ip security products increases alans appointment to this sector of our business will be hugely beneficial in order to further increase awareness and sales of the mobotix brand of products

4069404 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states

4069406 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police he said
4069407 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing he said

4069413 als je ons vergelijkt met andere meldingsplichtige bedrijven dan zit rsdb nog steeds aan de bovenkant van de markt maar de marges zullen ook in de tweede helft onder druk staan en er is sprake van prijserosie dat zal in de rest van 2008 tot uitdrukking komen in de resultaten
4069414 de financiering van de overname bevindt zich in de afrondingsfase aandeelhouders zijn in meerderheid akkoord en dus is er weinig reden te veronderstellen dat de overname niet doorgaat
4069415 we hebben de koers van quebecor nadat wij een bod deden op de europese printtak scherp zien dalen omdat het bedrijf veel afschrijvingen moest doen en omdat wellicht de prijs die wij boden te laag werd gevonden bovendien kreeg het bedrijf een financiering van 1 mrd niet rond quebecor zou in onze deal een belang van bijna 30 in rsdb krijgen voor hhbv was dat aspect reden om niet te participeren in deze stap omdat hhbv geen deelneming wil in bedrijven met een beursnotering

4069421 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
4069422 let us be very clear resolution no 10 has no intention whatsoever to extend her term or my term or anybody elses term its only purpose is the adoption of the federal system of government
4069423 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4069424 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4069425 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4069426 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4069427 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4069428 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4069429 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4069430 we zullen het doel dit jaar waarschijnlijk niet halen maar misschien zullen we volgend jaar een inhaalslag kunnen maken

4069437 its really not sore fatigued to be honest with you im kind of surprised i half feel good ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4069438 i think maybe this afternoon im going to talk to eric mangini about it limiting my throws i didnt throw the ball very well this morning no pain but im 38 years old i have to be fatigued a little bit
4069439 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range

4069444 we want to stay in our building its very much our home
4069445 the idea of coming to work every day under a microsoft sign is not so appealing to us
4069446 microsoft has a valid lease at the building that was negotiated in good faith
4069447 microsoft is committed to its partners and employees in massachusetts and looks forward to expanding its strong r amp d presence in cambridge
4069448 after blackstone took over their intent seemed to be to clear the building out
4069449 from their perspective making it the microsoft building is probably a lucrative investment strategy
4069450 asserted that microsofts presence would be a threat to the internet security of intersystems and claimed intersystems would now have to operate its business differently
4069451 a bid came in last night wednesday and it was immediately rejected
4069452 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4069453 the idea started with the irish blog awards and the recognition that there were so many categories people said there should be the same kind of awards for websites
4069454 people were saying these sites are great i spend all my time there boards ie recently had its 10th anniversary and married people have said how they met each other on it theres a huge community out there that seems to be almost ignored by the other awards because theyre not commercial business sites there are tonnes of niche areas out there that other awards because they are already so big dont cover
4069455 our previous involvement with the blog awards showed us the power of online communities and the immense pride people have for their work as well as the work of each other
4069456 while the web in itself represents a far greater magnitude of traffic than blogs i dont think it will eclipse the blog awards instead what we want to do is take the energy of the blog awards and give it to the web community at large
4069457 de ontwikkelingen in het eerste halfjaar van 2008 bevestigen de door friesland foods in het jaarverslag 2007 uitgesproken verwachting dat in 2008 met name in azi en afrika de margedruk zal aanhouden als gevolg van de hoge grondstofkosten verder blijkt dat de opbrengstprijzen meer dan in het verleden fluctueren en dat kleine veranderingen in vraag en aanbod leiden tot grotere prijsschommelingen in vooral melk en weipoeder kaas en boter
4069458 silly spanish basketball team look at what they are doing
4069459 to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing
4069460 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4069461 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4069462 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4069463 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics
4069464 if they havent realized their mistake yet they probably will hear about it when the nba season comes back around
4069465 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4069466 ultimately there is a very good relationship between the chinese and spanish governments and there is no kind of conflict at all between the two peoples
4069467 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people
4069468 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4069469 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose

4069471 the ball was so wet and heavy it was hard to lob it over tinys head he got everything

4069473 now we start from scratch killing one lion a day
4069474 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4069475 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4069476 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4069477 far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4069478 by giving young people a taste of what independent study is like at university it helps bridge the gap and raise ambition
4069479 it simply isnt good enough that the educational divide between rich and poor is so wide
4069480 were in a position right now of the democrats trying to figure out what to do an energy bill that addresses the needs presented today
4069481 lets have a vote i would rather have a comprehensive energy plan speaker pelosi mentioned she would be open to more drilling and exploration we would like to follow up she should come back to the floor so then we wouldnt have to worry about the moratorium or a presidential veto
4069482 the heartland of this country that produces the food that manufactures the goods that creates the energy that gets shipped to the large urban areas cross party lines do not understand the reason we cannot use our resources responsibly
4069483 would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling
4069484 i would not it depends how the drilling is put forth but i dont that is not excluded let me say it that way it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there
4069485 this is the liberal coastal elites against the heartland of the u s
4069486 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
4069487 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4069488 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4069489 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4069490 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4069491 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know

4069496 today we plan to be tougher in addressing this problem

4069499 our relations with the alliance cannot but change after jaap de hoop scheffer the nato chief did not say a word about the victims of the attack
4069500 the results of this years election will have an enormous impact on the competitiveness of our countrys businesses and workers
4069501 through these tours were setting out to build member awareness about how policy issues in washington impact millions of americans jobs
4069502 the governments vision is an equal inclusive society in northern ireland where everyone is treated with respect and where opportunity for all remains a priority
4069503 despite the worsening business environment and increasing inflationary pressures in the uk economy and in particular increasing energy costs the group continues to have good forward visibility
4069504 order intake remains satisfactory as usual the results will be weighted to the second half and this is likely to be compounded by the contribution of new products subject to global economic conditions the outlook for the second half is satisfactory
4069505 that although he could not have been much over forty his forehead was wrinkled in fan like folds above the root of his nose

4069508 the grand hotels ranged in a semicircle rising to the heights the pacifik the atlantic the metropole the polonia and bohemia with their rows of balconies their corner turrets and roof ridges emerging from the morning mist like oceangoing steamers from a dark sea
4069509 kept feeling as if someone else were walking beside him
4069510 why do i see your lips opening as if you were about to say something maybe even cry out loud and then i hear not the slightest sound

4069513 painful sentiments came out why the local government leaders were not informed of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain it was our fist time to see the copy of it
4069514 definitely there was no shouting match but the conversations were very frank and direct
4069515 the misinterpretations have added general confusion now we know that the moa ad is not the final peace agreement and will always be up to congressional actions
4069516 they are going to take 1 3 of the province the eight barangays in the four towns would be under category b which are mostly christian dominated we want out of the agreement
4069517 i am happy i got hold of the copy of moa ad but still i am going to refer this to our legal people so that we can truly thresh this out we want peace but we need to know things like this
4069518 the ied has exploded prematurely while it was still under the possession of the suspect this was why it did not create much impact

4069521 we have got to earn things from our performance levels
4069522 otherwise all through the season the press will do the quaint story of little old albion going off to play liverpool or manchester united as lambs to the slaughter
4069523 it is important that we change the perception and show that thats not the case and we are there on merit
4069524 we have to show we are competitive and we have every chance of winning the games were going into and it isnt a question of enjoying the day
4069525 we have to earn that right with performances on the pitch and if that doesnt happen this year we will get portrayed as a little club just enjoying their season in the premiership but getting back to reality next year
4069526 we have to try to change that and i think attitudes can change it
4069527 weve got to feel like we deserve to be there and in every single minute of every game the supporters the players and everyone else involved with the club have to make sure that they arent just little old albion enjoying the season
4069528 we are under no illusions about the task arsenal might have lost one or two games over the last year or so but i dont think theyve lost any at the emirates
4069529 its a difficult game for us but we wont show any fear we will go into it as positive as we can

4069532 first you must know the rudimentary basics of how keywords work
4069533 the army itself admits that they could not tell whether they were looking at a camera on a tripod or an anti tank missile system on a tripod
4069534 devastating force with a weapon that is designed to kill as many people as possible
4069535 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4069536 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4069537 this policy to shoot first if there is the slightest doubt has rendered it almost impossible for us to do our jobs in gaza along with the rest of the international media
4069538 these are situations faced internationally and we have to find a better way to make sure journalists are not caught up in crossfire
4069539 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
4069540 complying with legislation can be complex at times but employment law is often easier than business owners think instead of spending money on buying in professional advice on employment law employers can get access to a range of easy to use fully compliant documents that take only a few minutes to complete
4069541 small firms in particular will appreciate the governments support and guidance being in one place with the free tools a cost effective way to reduce time spent calculating things like sick pay

4069545 we take it for granted that a vote means a secret ballot but it was not always that way moreover it will not remain that way for workers who vote on whether or not they want a labor union if legislation sponsored by congressional democrats and endorsed by senator barack obama becomes law before there were secret ballots voters dared not express their true preferences if those who watched them vote could retaliate whether by firing them beating them up or in other ways
4069546 the legislation is called the employee free choice act and i am sad to say it runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard efca risks silencing those who would speak the key provision of efca is a change in the mechanism by which unions are formed and recognized instead of a private election with a secret ballot overseen by an impartial federal board union organizers would simply need to gather signatures from more than 50 of the employees in a workplace or bargaining unit a system known as card check there are many documented cases where workers have been pressured harassed tricked and intimidated into signing cards that have led to mandatory payment of dues
4069547 these new offerings reflect customers desires for national brands local flavor and specialty retailers
4069548 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
4069549 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
4069550 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
4069551 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
4069552 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
4069553 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers
4069554 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
4069555 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
4069556 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
4069557 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
4069558 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
4069559 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
4069560 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
4069561 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years

4069570 are you serious how come i never heard about it
4069571 for the most part protests never made its way out of the asian american community had he slurred any other racial group this way there is no way he is still running for president
4069572 well why havent i heard about it now i tend to follow matters on race and politics pretty closely i would think that this would come up during a presidential campaign

4069585 it s healthy to have a discussion on the team combination that is why we make it a point to sit down and listen to the coach and captain shoaib malik before selecting the national team
4069586 it s written in our contracts that the selection committee s word would be final in selection matters and both the coach and captain know it

4069605 get changed first then come through to my dressing room
4069606 kame this is really important to me and its taken me a lot of courage to be able to say it so please listen carefully okay
4069607 thats okay i kind of thought so you being gay changes absolutely nothing between us
4069608 im so shocked at the moment i cant think i cant reply to you
4069609 gaki san can you give me half an hour to think about this
4069610 gaki san ive never been confessed to by a girl before heck ive never been confessed to by a guy before
4069611 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
4069612 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
4069613 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
4069614 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
4069615 we just dont have the cars denver just isnt really big on chauffeurs
4069616 i am totally booked and have been for six weeks
4069617 ayckbourn has created in very human terms a description of how capricious fate is
4069618 its a dazzling tour de force for great comedic actors and a hilarious description of our chaotic universe it is one of ayckbourns greatest plays and speaks to us vividly about a lack of emotional and spiritual compass that most of us experience today
4069619 the female character makes a decision in the first few lines of the play and from that two quite different scenes develop the play is about those tiny decisions we all make in our lives that lead to bigger consequences its a huge concept and is very difficult as there are just two actors playing a total of ten roles all the characters are very different and it is a feat of memory for the actors to learn about 16 to 17 hours worth of dialogue after a production like this you dont have a nerve in your body because it cant get any worse
4069620 they send a bunch of letters too and i like coach urban meyer
4069621 ive met with some of the coaches during the spring and really
4069622 the combination of solid operating performance and improved capital efficiency gave us record earnings this quarter and nearly 5 billion in free cash flow in the first half of fiscal year
4069623 whilst clearly engaged with the issue of their own online identity britons are impressively open minded when it comes to seeing others online
4069624 perhaps britains rather detached view of online material may sometimes lead britons to miss out on forging valuable online friendships
4069625 if i were the computer industry i would be panicked because its not obvious what the solution is going to look like and whether we will get there in time for these new machines
4069626 its a crisis and i wonder whether what we are doing and what is happening within the industry is too little too late
4069627 whoever figures out how to take advantage of multicore first could wreak some serious economic damage on their competition
4069628 if i was approached i would go because being a fringe player and wanting to play for my country it just makes sense for me
4069629 i can understand the senior players not wanting to go they are comfortable with their position in the team but the fringe players like and the up and coming players will grab it because you may never get a chance again
4069630 you jump at any chance like this and you hope that the icc have got it right i never felt threatened then but it could be different now with more teams and more at stake but equally there should be more security
4069631 in sri lanka last year there were bombs going off while we were there but you did not feel threatened by it because you have got the security detail and the army give you escorts
4069632 id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4069633 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back inside me i think i would not have a problem
4069634 id be happy to go to pakistan thats for sure
4069635 when the decision is made to go i am sure security will not come into play because at that point they should already know that it is safe to go
4069636 you can go to a number of places in this world that are dangerous
4069637 but at the end of the day its not my call and its up to cricket australia im sure they will do everything they can to make sure its safe
4069638 personally id go anywhere ill play anywhere i just want to play for my country
4069639 thats what ive worked so hard for the injuries ive had pretty up and down times over the last year so id do anything to play for my country so wherever we have to go ill go
4069640 my parents jim and judy musta initially thought i was crazy but it really was a great way to see the country much better than traveling 70 miles per hour on interstates
4069641 but ive made a lot of new friends on the team
4069642 i cant believe the trip is almost over were already planning a reunion
4069643 we eat tremendous amounts of food three times a day and i still managed to lose 15 pounds
4069644 we like to provide pittsburgh favorites like isalys chipped ham kielbasa and sauerkraut haluski and eatn park smiley cookies
4069645 the men from the journey of hope come through here every year and they are awesome
4069646 if we cant play away and if the other team cant have us come there well have to forfeit the game
4069647 ive been doing this 30 some years and this is the first time we havent had a field

4069650 under this policy were going to have more of our kids participating at our facilities
4069651 and i pay 52 a year in emergency services tax for that privilege thats only fair
4069652 if the goal is to have nondistrict residents pay then just set a reasonable nondistrict fee something they can pay in lieu of taxes
4069653 theyre out here learning how to hit how to catch how to block and tackle
4069654 if i had to redo this policy i would be willing to review the fee structure
4069655 but im not going to go much below 90 percent
4069656 it would be nice to have copies of those to share
4069657 it occurred to me that perhaps some other people might want the same kind of service

4069661 the bourgeois have very good reasons for imputing supernatural creative power to labour since it follows precisely from the fact that labour depends on nature that a man who has no other property than his labour must be in all societies and civilizations the slave of other people who have become proprietors of the material working conditions
4069662 i must admit i have reached the point where i dont make any sudden movements or walk a lot because i fear i might tear my clothes even more
4069663 we twijfelen er niet aan dat die vrouw het meent en begaan is en we voelen ook wel een gepaste trots maar we hebben ook angst dat het iets meer wordt dan een eerbetoon
