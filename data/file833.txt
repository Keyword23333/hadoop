8330006 technically any computer capable of connecting to the internet can be used to cast a vote
8330007 but my ruling is going to be that the term polling booth should mean the official computers ousa sets up my recommendation will also be that ousa will need to revisit the 20m rule

8330018 this is a strange and localised problem to declare a power savings campaign just for south islanders might be strange and might not go down too well
8330019 as the night gets later the number of tourists drinking in the premises drops off and the number of late night workers having a drink on their way home increases noticeably

8330080 this latest evidence needs to be considered in light of two separate tests conducted by the transport accident investigation commission which each reached different conclusions and which the commission itself accepted could therefore not be relied upon
8330081 the inconsistency of the results reflects the difficulty experienced by both authorities in assessing the seaworthiness of the vessel after the accident this was due to the kotuku being badly damaged after sinking and saturated after spending a week on the sea floor prior to it being transported via road and subjected to further tests while drying out in the open air

8330151 perhaps the greatest battle being fought in 2008 is the one raging just below the surface of the republican party barely covered if at all its the tug of war between ideologies its the social conservatives who claim this party as their own and have for a generation versus the more centrist younger bloc of fiscally conservative socially moderate republicans

8330157 rising to the occasion hillary clinton was perfect im quite convinced she wouldve been our nominee had she voted against george w bush s war in iraq and she wouldve been a great nominee
8330158 its hard to pick out the best quotes from hillarys speech tonight because the whole damn thing was so good
8330159 i dont think hit it out of the park begins to describe the speech
8330160 i wish i had a more substantive less rah rah reaction for you but i really think she just accomplished everything that she needed to and did so in style
8330161 hillary was terrific she just nailed the speech nailed it
8330162 if the idiots in the media keep playing up the clinton obama rift after this they are hopeless
8330163 that was quite a speech it occurred to me as she built to the conclusion in the last few minutes that the pre 2008 hillary clinton would not have been capable of that speech thats not a dig but she grew incredibly as a candidate over the course of this campaign and this was an immensely powerful delivery and a richly woven together speech the beginning seemed fine but not remarkable but it slowly built into something very powerful
8330164 hillary did everything she came to do tuesday night and she did it with sincerity and style she acknowledged her incredible historic run and many supporters while drawing a clear contrast between the policies of obama clinton and those of bush mccain she came to convincingly make the case to all her holdouts know that obama is the only candidate in the race who will fight for their values and she succeeded wildly bravo
8330165 what a speech in that moment at that time just an unbelievable speech heres my bottom line after tonight the republicans hate hillary again it was a dagger through mccains political heart
8330166 clintons case against mccain is pretty strong and thats good for democrats but without a strong pro obama message it reinforces the sense that obama is the lesser of two evils that dominates her speech sure thats probably what she thinks but it hardly seems like the best job she could have done to convince her strongest supporters
8330167 on second thought maybe simply ignoring obama and ripping mccain was the best approach after all her hardest core supporters probably arent going to be convinced that obama is awesome and as an anti mccain speech it was great plus on purely aesthetic grounds it was the best speech ive ever seen her give
8330168 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8330169 its a very effective line and a generous one she showed leadership there by explicitly challenging her most ardent followers to look beyond her thats not easy for politicians to do
8330170 that is the winning line thats the one that showed me that she genuinely did her best to actually convince her followers that they had to support barack obama thats not a half hearted effort thats a line designed to win people over to her argument not over to her personally
8330171 this line was a powerful reminder that clintons values and priorities are more important than one candidate or one campaign it was an obvious argument that clinton made eloquently it wont honor clinton to betray her vision for a stronger nation to support her is to support her agenda and obama shares her agenda
8330172 this was by far her most intellectually interesting point she was essentially calling on her supporters better angels she was being their conscience and their voice of reason you know these political speeches have a lot of bs and its hard for a cynical audience to be moved by them either intellectually or emotionally but i keep finding that line staying with me lingering in my head it was a powerful point and i hope it gets coverage if obama consolidates democrats he wins and that line does more for that goal than the rest of hillarys speech combined
8330173 hillary was passionate about the issues but her talk of obama and mccain was perfunctory she endorsed obama but she didnt redstates
8330174 there was no real praise for barack obama in that speech she did not praise him at all it was pro forma rhetoric
8330175 you can imagine bill and hillary when the speech was being drafted putting the stuff about obama on a scale and calibrating it word for word syllable by syllable until they had reached the perfect bare minimum about obama
8330176 she basically said that democrats should vote for barack obama because they agree with him there is still no audio visual rebutal to hillarys not ready statements that she made in debates that has become the republican communications rallying cry she and bill did their duty as democrats but are leaving enough out that republicans hillary supporters and independents have something to chew on
8330177 at the risk of sowing discord in the democratic ranks allow me to offer that hillary did not do all that she could have done for barack obama indeed she did the bare minimum the speech was only a success for obama if you considered it a possibility that she would come out and explicitly endorse mccain think of it this way she and obama have been senate colleagues for four years and spent 18 months together on the campaign trail and she still couldnt manage to offer a single anecdote of why she liked him or thought he should be president every time she said barack obama you could have slid in our generic nominee and the speech would have worked just as well if she really was into all this team player stuff she would have told america why she now appreciates the error of her ways and knows that barack obama should be taking that 3 in the morning phone call
8330178 as far as i can tell hillary continued to play the game thats she played brilliantly so far she said she supports barack and told everyone to vote for him without offering any real reasons why they should reasons that might inadvertantly convince someone actually to do it her words of support of course allow her to ask anyone who doubts her commitment well what else was i supposed to say but as a shrewd politician and the wife of a very shrewd politician she knows the objectives of a political convention to give the country a comfort level with a candidate on a personal level along with good solid reasons that he is not just the better choice but the best one for the country at this particular time her speech advanced neither objective for obama
8330179 this will serve as a good launch pad for her 2012 presidential run if john mccain wins im also sure it will help with party unity but while it was a good night for her its hard to see what it will do to convince undecided voters that barack obama should be president
8330180 will the speech be effective time will tell but i believe this speech will go at least a significant way towards convincing her supporters to remain in the tent it may take a few days for that to become apparent but id expect a slow drift of hillary dead enders to return to barack obama
8330181 i think she did as much for obama as he could have hoped for clintons core feminist supports the sisterhood of the traveling pants suits as she called them tonight will very likely fall into line barring some major misstep by obama my guess is that they would have eventually gotten behind obama even with a lesser speech they really have no place else to go the folks who voted for clinton because they dont like obama will continue to consider their options but not because there was anything clinton could have said but didnt say to win them over
8330182 the former president speaking in denver posed a hypothetical question in which he seemed to suggest that that the democratic party was making a mistake in choosing obama as its presidential nominee
8330183 bill clinton twists the knife in baracks back yowch chicago thug mafia meet arkansas thug mafia long live democrat party nros
8330184 tell me again that bill clintons on board oh did obama cause himself some headaches when he didnt even go through the motions of vetting hillary
8330185 i dont believe it for a minute its simply too petulant even for him and too dangerous a signal to the pumas for party bigwigs to let him get away with it but how unspeakably awesome is it that this is what the top of drudge looks like as her majesty is taking the stage at the convention we owe him one dont we
8330186 however rousing hillary clintons speech sought to be in praising barack obama the fact remains that you can judge the clintons better by looking at their actions rather than listening to their words again it bears repeating bill clinton would not be throwing a fit if hillary clinton told him not to and told him that throwing a fit would hurt her politically by making her look less than loyal
8330187 barack obama really really does not like it when you point out that his political career was launched in the home of unrepentant although incompetent terrorist bill ayers
8330188 by defending ayers obama made his connection to ayers a legitimate though still tangential issue he thus finds himself the subject of an ad about the connection the ad is powerful but obamas reaction to it calling on the government to curtail the right of citizens to air the ad seems over the top
8330189 obamas dodge that ayers crimes were done when he was a boy doesnt begin to address his close working relationship and friendship with the terrorist whose views on america are deeply repulsive to the vast majority of americans like he did with jeremiah wright obama will now try and persuade the public that this isnt the ayers that he knew but the voters arent fools the rosen interview and the sds reunion tapes from november 2007 tell us that ayers has never hidden who he is or what he believes obama knew and as with jeremiah wright obama didnt care until the voters noticed
8330190 culture wars the role of race gender ethnicity religion and values in the fall campaign
8330191 these pumas are tooling around in hummers a lot of them voted for george bush twice and were supposed to believe that theyre disgruntled democrats
8330192 these people who purport to be fighting in her name arent following her wishes so maybe theyre not actually supporters of hillary clinton
8330193 there are three of those mccain ads featuring clinton two of them have only aired on the networks so you guys are doing mccains work for him
8330194 the majority of these youtube ads are designed solely to get media attention not to be seriously used as part of the campaign if they were podcasts or blog posts or flyers or email blasts the media would ignore them if their purpose were so transparent i mean who cares about a flyer produced in small quantities and handed out only to the media but if its video its news so id say this cable news stations need to stop being played for suckers unless a campaign says its committed to a serious ad buy for the video in question its time to quit playing the game wise up and treat em the same way you treat attack email blasts
8330195 this is why ive stopped reporting on the new mccain hillary ads theyre almost video press releases running on fumes
8330196 spike lee on msnbc was hilarious one thing that i was reminded of spike was asked if he ever thought hed see this day he responded never that is the difference between black men women and white women i think a large number of hillary supporters believe that a white woman could actually be nominated and hillary seemed perfectly set up for it shes also been known among feminists since her college days but as much as barack came out of nowhere for the country he completely snuck up on black folks we never saw this coming i think that explains a lot of the bitterness its not like weve been waiting 30 years for this a black president was the sort of thing you used as a punchline or as like a cultural symbol of something but we didnt really think about it as a literal reality i would not have been surprised or particularly upset if i had died without their ever being a black president but thats the trouble with expectations i may be now

8330304 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8330305 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8330306 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8330307 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8330308 this is aimed at a worldwide tv audience not a bunch of rock buffs so you cant have richard thompson or the aphex twin
8330309 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8330310 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8330311 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8330312 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8330313 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8330314 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8330315 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8330316 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8330317 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8330318 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8330319 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8330320 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8330321 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8330322 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

8330326 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8330327 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8330328 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8330329 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8330330 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8330331 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this

8330340 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8330341 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8330342 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

8330344 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8330345 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8330346 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

8330348 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8330349 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8330350 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8330351 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8330352 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8330353 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8330354 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8330355 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8330356 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8330357 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8330358 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8330359 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8330360 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8330361 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8330362 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8330363 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8330364 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8330365 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8330366 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8330367 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8330368 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8330369 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8330370 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8330371 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8330372 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8330373 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8330374 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8330375 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8330376 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8330377 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8330378 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8330379 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8330380 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8330381 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8330382 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8330383 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8330384 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8330385 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8330386 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8330387 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8330388 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8330389 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8330390 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8330391 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8330392 we can make southwest pennsylvania the engine room for energy for the entire northeast
8330393 i am impressed by how willing people are to learn about this office and i think it has a lot to do with the financial hardships people are going through

8330396 dick fuld has the weekend to come up with a solution to lehmans problems
8330397 if he doesnt do it if he doesnt sell real estate or come in with some new equity then the game is on and lehman is in play
8330398 the market rallies and then traders have second thoughts about the health of the financials a sell off follows and we find ourselves roughly where we started the pattern remains the same
8330399 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8330400 members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8330401 the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
8330402 the government has put this re competition on a very tight schedule
8330403 what you see here is the improbability of conducting a major competition in record time
8330404 serious troubles in chinas economy could threaten the stability of the u s and global economies
8330405 she is awesome i felt so much power and wisdom from hillary tonight
8330406 i felt a little pain within her its like she felt sorry for us that we didnt get the candidate we wanted
8330407 by several measures natural gas looks awfully cheap compared with crude oil wsj com when hurricanes threaten bankruptcy is not always liquidation perhaps bankruptcy is what you really need to truly restructure and sell cars people buy
8330408 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8330409 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8330410 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8330411 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8330412 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8330413 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8330414 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8330415 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8330416 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8330492 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8330493 you support candidate x you support candidate y well they both stink

8330496 you can also give the controller to her or use it yourself and play with the power of the vibrations
8330497 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8330498 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8330499 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

8330502 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8330503 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8330504 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8330508 the people who are responsible for illegally dumping these materials they need to come forward and do medical monitoring and help
8330509 but the recognition of these unrecognized republics will without doubt stick in the minds of a lot of people in the north caucaus
8330510 in chechnya there is still separatist sentiment so a precedent will be set if one lot of people can have it then why cant the others it will have an impact
8330511 russia shouts about western double standards at the top of its voice but does not have the slightest hesitation to use the same method
8330512 they called what had happened a genocide it is very hurtful and funny to observe all this from the point of view of people who went through the complete destruction of a nation and on top of that were called a nation of bandits
8330513 inaction by russia on the georgian regions would have been absolutely not understood least of all by the population of the north caucasus
8330514 it has become clear that russia in the north caucasus is strong and it is prepared to act including with arms without taking account of anyones opinion
8330515 it has shown strength and in the north caucasus they respect strength very much
8330516 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen joseph lieberman as the republican candidate for vice president are not a fairy tale influential mccain backers plus mccain himself would pick the pro choice liberal from connecticut if they thought they could get away with it
8330517 but they cant get away with it and this has been made clear to mccain by none other than joe lieberman himself
8330518 i just care that we live in a country where the media think that other peoples sex lives are any of their business
8330519 i find it perplexing that they make us feel like outliers or rogues because at the convention we plan to vote for the candidate we were elected to vote for
8330520 if he said clinton was on the shortlist and did not vet her at all what does that say about the veracity of his words my intent was to come to denver with an open mind how all of us would be treated is a measure of how inclusive obamas campaign and presidency would be his campaign is all about post partisan washington but if he cant even do it with his own party how can he do it as president
8330521 its important that obama show respect not just for the candidate but for those who voted for the candidate
8330522 i would desperately like to be able to do what hillary tells us and support him as president
8330523 i respect what clintons saying i have a different path to unity
8330524 going to tell us to vote for obama its not up to her to convince me to vote for obama its up to obama to do this
8330525 oh come and see the violence inherent in the system help help im being repressed
8330526 as i have tried to explain our statutes to indian women i have met with but one response
8330527 as an indian woman i was free i owned my home my person the work of my own hands and my children could never forget me i was better as an indian woman than under white law
8330528 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8330529 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8330530 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8330531 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8330532 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8330533 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8330534 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8330535 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8330536 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8330537 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8330538 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8330539 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8330540 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8330541 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8330542 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8330543 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8330544 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8330545 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8330546 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8330547 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8330548 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8330549 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8330550 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8330551 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8330552 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8330553 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8330554 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8330555 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8330556 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8330557 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8330558 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8330559 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8330560 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8330561 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8330562 ent s el kel isten verotus saako el kel isetkin ty tulov hennyksen vai kusiko kokoomus meit taas silm n
8330563 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8330564 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8330565 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8330566 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8330567 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8330568 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8330569 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8330570 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8330571 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8330572 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8330573 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8330574 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8330575 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8330576 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8330577 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8330578 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8330579 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8330580 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8330581 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8330582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8330583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8330584 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8330585 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8330586 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8330587 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8330588 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8330589 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8330591 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8330594 this is a faithful saying worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners
8330595 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8330596 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8330597 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8330598 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8330618 men and brethren this scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas who became a guide to those who arrested jesus 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry
8330619 therefore of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us 22 beginning from the baptism of john to that day when he was taken up from us one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection
8330620 you o lord who know the hearts of all show which of these two you have chosen 25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place

8330639 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us

8330641 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8330642 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8330643 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8330644 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8330645 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8330646 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8330647 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8330648 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8330649 can you get back to me when you have those addressed
8330650 oh mr boss guy dude i did give those to blah blah blah she said she would get back to me let me follow up with her right now
8330651 the result for the permatang pauh by election is already out and the decision favours anwar so he will be sworn in on thursday
8330652 the election commission has been effective no one can force me not to allow anwar to take his oath tomorrow there is no reason why we cannot have the swearing in tomorrow
8330653 it can be done anywhere including my office as long as he does it within 60 days
8330654 there is no need for everyone to come anwars supporters this is just an ordinary sitting with the permatang pauh seat vacated by anwars wife datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail and we had a by election and we know that anwar is the elected representative
8330655 politics is a game what is today will be different swearing in i believe the speaker will announce the appointment of the new opposition leader
8330656 we are glad with the victory in permatang pauh with great majority and we are sending a clear message to umno and barisan nasional that the people wanted a new politics

8330662 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8330663 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8330664 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8330665 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8330666 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8330667 what this shows is that you can go directly from one type of adult cell to another without going back to the beginning
8330668 you could say for example its like turning a scientist into a lawyer without sending her all the way back to kindergarten
8330669 meltons work is going to inspire an explosion of experiments in directing the fate of tissues in one way or another in ways that may be more practical than having to reprogram them back to pluripotency

8330674 this is a disease that has afflicted members of my family and friends but too few people realize what a widespread problem it is i hope this run will change that
8330675 in the past year ive been contacted by people from around the country who want to fight lupus and have just been looking for a way to help runners are a passionate group when they take up a cause
8330676 we are tired of seeing our loved ones hurt by this disease
8330677 the more people that are willing to listen to us the more of a difference we can make
8330678 al milan ci sono grandi campioni e non ci sarebbe stato tanto spazio per me ha spiegato il giovane attaccante qui invece ho la possibilit di giocare e di crescere potrebbe essere davvero un importante trampolino di lancio se poi dovesse arrivare la promozione in serie a sarei molto felice di rimanere qui a lungo
8330679 last thursday they were getting nazi salutes on the streets and plenty of abuse
8330680 people have been walking up to the wardens and shaking their hands and saying well done keep up the good work
8330681 they have got so many calls of support from people all around the country and they have got a letter of support from their work colleagues at the council
8330682 some people just have the attitude the wardens are there to be abused and its wrong
8330683 if we didnt get that contribution the rates would have to go up by 567 000 to maintain the roading budget
8330684 vertically integrating the feed supply chain by purchasing grain from crts arable farming shareholders adding value to it through the manufacturing process and then selling the finished products to crts pastoral shareholder base has many benefits for crt and its share holders
8330685 not the least of these is the ability for profits made throughout the supply chain to be redistributed to the farmers that generated them
8330686 this sale gives winton stock feed the opportunity to focus on growing our nationwide molasses and bulk imported dairy meal distribution business

8330689 much of these cases occurred in the citys east and north and it is still difficult to determine if there is a common motive
8330690 what is certain is that there is a group of hitmen killing people and throwing bodies into the medell n river
8330691 hitmen are being paid well to kill people who appear on a list
8330692 just as in the era of pablo escobar they paid for dead police today they pay for dead demobilized paramilitaries
8330693 when they tranferred don berna he lost control over the citys armed groups and what there is now is a dispute for control of these groups
8330694 its been a big experience people being killed one killed by a falling tree and a helicopter crashing
8330695 you have to be doing everything right to make sure the guys youre looking after are going to get back home at night
8330696 a friend told me the other day that they were struggling to get enough food and im a bit of a softy when it comes to animals so i thought i would try help out
8330697 only those blinded by ideology would deny that lvaro uribe has made colombia a better place
8330698 t he democrats control congress where they are disgracefully blocking a trade agreement with colombia mainly because of their distaste for mr uribe
8330699 to familiarize them with the u s northern command and southern command as well as to emphasize the strong cooperation association with mexico which is critical for the security of both countries north america and the hemisphere
8330700 firstly the documents from reyess laptop again fail to corroborate the colombian governments allegations
8330701 wait a minute youre not from telesur are you wait a minute youre cnn ah this is a legitimate news station its cnn come and join us
8330702 telesur is a terrorist propaganda front and deserves to be treated like one
8330703 if angel isnt hugo who could it be and why would farc be dumb enough to believe such promises
8330704 your honour if angel isnt hugo then who could it be
8330705 hmmmm compelling evidence camilla guards take him down to the cells
8330706 he approved completely and without blinking at our request 300
8330707 300 figure whatever that figure may or may not be although i was reading a copied and pasted version from the wsj on another website
8330708 300 is the email is extremely weak as source of evidence
8330709 as for your claims on the 300m i think you are leaving out the farc computer notes from farc thugs marveling at how chavez offered the money without blinking
8330710 to me his actions lend a lot of credibility to the notion that there was a substantial amount of contact between his govt and the farc under his auspices
8330711 declassified u s cables and pentagon intelligence reports show that as far back as the late 1980s colombian and u s officials were reporting that ch vez and people close to him were meeting with colombian rebels they discussed among other things how the guerrillas wanted to create a semiautonomous region along the border between the two countries according to the documents obtained by the national security archive at george washington university and shared with the washington post
8330712 at the invitation of bolivarian organizations based in venezuela with the approval of venezuelan government authorities
8330713 the venezuelan government lets farc operate freely because they share the same left wing bolivarian ideals and because farc bribes their people
8330714 we are with you be strong we are following your cause
8330715 we pay tribute to a true revolutionary who was ra l reyes
8330716 300 though it almost certainly means some measure of money but there are enough single pearls here to string together a grand necklace
8330717 heres a few examples that chavez supporters may try to argue individually but look pretty damning in totality
8330718 the venezuelan president hugo chavez has called on the colombian rebel group farc to end its decades long rebellion and free the hundreds of hostages its holding
8330719 there are old folk women sick people soldiers who have been prisoners in the mountain for 10 years
8330720 colombias defence minister juan manuel santos has welcomed a call by venezuelan president hugo chavez for farc rebels to end their four decade struggle
8330721 captured reyes laptop reveals farc delivered a large sum of money to chavez when he was in prison an honest mind would ask why would they be so generous
8330722 2004 khadaffy award winner chavez is pals with carlos the jackal
8330723 chavez basically admitted he was harboring farc leaders when he declared if uribe were to attempt snuffing out some farc terrorists inside venezuela there would be war
8330724 sure explain away items here and there quibble over the exact meaning of
8330725 while the humanitarian accord in the view of polo president carlos gaviria is still a valid option the guerrillas must take note and be conscious that the citizens are asking for kidnappings to stop and the conflict to cease
8330726 the right wing faction unfortunately appears to be the dominant faction
8330727 meanwhile all the us and colombian media and government officialdom have to offer is psychological warfare to make up for a country that is ruled by a well known drug trafficker and war criminal mr alvaro uribe velez
8330728 meanwhile all the us and colombian media and government officialdom have to offer is psychological warfare to make up for a country that is ruled by a well known drug trafficker and war criminal mr alvaro uribe velez
8330729 the marches reflect a national mood in which only a minority of colombians are willing to support negotiations with the farc beyond terms of surrender they rest appear to prefer to pay the cost which could total several years thousands of lives and billions of dollars of a continued military campaign
8330730 see this colombia see the extended hand of president uribe and understand that it is time to stop the bloodshed
8330731 anyone who speaks in the name of others is always an imposter
8330732 in their own vehicle a privilege before reserved only for ambassadors and high ranking personalities
8330733 is how the paramilitary representatives in recorded conversations referred to the presidential palace the
8330734 the icc represents a new legal system in which impunity is now inviable either the national tribunals take charge or we will
8330735 the scores dont mean anything at the end of the day quite often its been really tightly contested and there have been some really good games
8330736 but this year we have really gelled together as a team its a team of ex representative players and mothers who dont want to give up netball just yet so we come back and just play on thursday nights with no practices and just roll up and play the game
8330737 we have a lot of fun but we are still serious on the court
8330738 that would be really good but it would also be nice to get everyone on court so well see what we can do there
8330739 its just keeping it nice and steady and playing our own game instead of trying to adapt to theirs
8330740 its keeping it flat they play a completely different style than females which is quite hard to adjust to it was a really good game last time we played them so hopefully we can make it a good final for everyone
8330741 period 1948 1953 this indicator grew from 1 to 2
8330742 the upward spiral colombias defense expenditures and u s military aid
8330743 but iran wants to wipe israel from the pages of our history books
8330744 in both israel or rather the territories it occupies and colombia etc etc
8330745 of which expanding in such territories is illegal under international law in the eyes of the majority of non israeli affiliated lawyers
8330746 both colombia and israel receive lots of u s military aid
8330747 so i could go on giving examples but i think you get my point
8330748 so i can indeed see a clear comparison between colombia and israel
8330749 why because im colombian im not israeli or palestinian or arab or muslim or u s american if it comes to that which implies far too many things for me to list here
8330750 i dont want to get into the israel or middle east debate for its own sake at all only to the extent such comparisons involve colombia so my description of the situation was deliberately restricted for that purpose alone
8330751 first off i think you should read up on how other countries have violated each others sovereignty in latin america including colombias you might find that interesting
8330752 why because im colombian im not israeli or palestinian or arab or muslim or u s american if it comes to that which implies far too many things for me to list here
8330753 mentioning corruption as a point of comparison is almost laughable with all due respect i couldnt know less about israels corruption but i do know very well that latin america in general has lots of it not just colombia which makes it a very pointless issue if something is so common what difference does it make to bring it up
8330754 there are foreign affairs im interested in and then there are foreign affairs im not either out of circumstance or willpower but i still care more about my nations own problems first and foremost and i see no sin in that at all
8330755 the bellicosity of both states is a comparison which you didnt try to negate the fact that this bellicosity is directly stimulated by munificent us aid is another comparison the fact that both states arguably serve the interests of their main sponsor the usa amidst cries of foul play is another direct comparison the fact that both states are accused of wide spread human rights violations whilst simultaneously receiving aid from a country the usa that claims to be the champion of human rights is another comparison
8330756 so yes you could make infinite comparisons and i could point to infinite differences but what would that lead to
8330757 the nuclear divide exists in part because of history and a genuine fear from regional states israel and its people have historically been subjected to the might of other powers and people as a result they have transpired into a period of opportune aggression and militarism specifically they act when they feel theyve been cornered or pressured
8330758 specifically they act when they feel theyve been cornered or pressured
8330759 it doesnt help anyone when iran hezbollah former iraq regime hamas and others threaten israel in anyway
8330760 if its israels arab neighbors would unequivocally state that israel has the right to exist and sign a peace treaty
8330761 but ironically they dont unequivocally state that israel has the right to exist and sign a peace treaty and the truth is that they will not because they use the threat of israel and its existence as a tool to manipulate their own people
8330762 if you can haphazardly blame all of your countries woes on the israelis and the us then you shift the focus anger of your population against them
8330763 i like your idealism but the world is not yet ready for it
8330764 mankind being arseholes and likely to continue to be for the time being
8330765 the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the middle east
8330766 united nations security council resolution 242 s res 242 was adopted unanimously by the un security council on november 22 1967 in the aftermath of the six day war it was adopted under chapter vi of the united nations charter
8330767 i wouldnt give my email to a loser like you
8330768 you and others still hold on to it 242 vehemently
8330769 jaime pointed out that i wasnt a middle east expert so where are you trying to go with that
8330770 from what i see youre not much of an expert either or a good one else your professed academic qualities would have convinced me long ago but they failed why think about it if you can
8330771 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8330772 all of modesto seems to descend on the attraction during its opening days alas too often the establishment is simply not equipped and or capable of withstanding this great frontal assault and alas soon the place is empty and erecting signs for yet another grand opening

8330784 i use an oven in the lab its easier but if the oven in your kitchen is not accurate cook eggs in plenty of water using a good thermometer
8330785 haramain milik semua umat islam letakkan haramain di bawah oic
8330786 je sais pas je ne pensais pas moccuper de a avant le 4e mois
8330787 well have four perhaps five generations of family members there
8330788 i had an old chevy it wasnt running very fast
8330789 i had to wait for him a couple of years
8330790 i had to light the fire in the morning and be the janitor and the teacher
8330791 my cousin invited me to hemet for the ramona pageant
8330792 i asked my cousin to fix me up with one of the indian dancers
8330793 i hocked a camera to make the down payment on a ring
8330794 i sat on the edge of the bed and asked them
8330795 selling sick notes is not illegal so a person could type one up and sell it without being prosecuted
8330796 it only becomes illegal when you receive a payment or advantage for instance paid time off work because of its use
8330797 we take fraud against the nhs very seriously and anyone caught using these fraudulent documents will be pursued vigorously
8330798 choose from doctors at medical centres in london manchester birmingham glasgow or any other area
8330799 the deliberate abuse of the sick certification system is to be condemned
8330800 this will also help them take positive action to support employees with genuine long term health problems
8330801 but the key thing is we need to separate out whats helpful and what needs to be looked at and perhaps set aside
8330802 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8330803 the environment is stimulating and entertaining and theres less fear of falling over
8330804 after a stroke or fall many older people lack motivation and confidence and they dont feel steady on their feet so getting out and about can be an issue and they can find the whole process rather dull
8330805 i can see it working very well on improving strength endurance and stamina
8330806 consistency and practice are key to making progress and this system has huge potential across a wide range of activities which can be tailored to meet individual rehabilitation needs
8330807 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control
8330808 walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system would help enormously
8330809 i was round a friends house smoking a joint when i started hearing something funny
8330810 i started hearing a womans voice cursing and swearing and thought thats not right
8330811 cannabis has absolutely wrecked my life i cant go out drinking or anything like that
8330812 i claim benefits and live on my own its been a long time since i had a girlfriend i manage the best i can
8330813 we do hear stories on a regular basis not only from people that use cannabis but also from concerned family and from concerned friends who can see somebody thats close to them someone they love who is going through a downward spiral
8330814 it can be very very difficult to watch so its not just the possible impact on the individual but also the broader impact as well that it might have on people they are close to
8330815 reclassification from a dealers point of view is just meaningless
8330816 it doesnt matter whether its class b or class c because the sentencing guidelines from the court are still the same
8330817 if you get caught you could get a maximum of 14 years on both so it doesnt really matter for a dealer because its the same penalties either way
8330818 i know that what im doing is illegal but how can something so wrong feel so right
8330819 ive just taken a seed ive put it into some soil added a little bit of water i cut it down i smoke it
8330820 i dont go out on the street i dont offer it to random people but i could have the police coming round here at six oclock in the morning
8330821 im not a criminal im not a bad guy but i face prosecution for growing
8330822 cannabis is a very serious drug its one of the most prevalent drugs particularly amongst young people
8330823 its a very dangerous drug particularly in the skunk form and thats why were taking the action that we are
8330824 honestly if you proposed the film work flow today youd be taken to the city square and hung imagine i told you were going to shoot on superexpensive cameras using rolls of celluloid made in china that are a one time use product susceptible to scratches and that cant be exposed to light and you cant even be sure you got the image until theyre developed and you have to dip them in a special fluid that can ruin them if its mixed wrong people would think i was crazy
8330825 survey after survey confirms that americans are becoming more pro life each year it is vital that the political parties understand this and incorporate it into their platforms

8330833 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
8330834 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
8330835 rien ne vaut une bonne crise ou un d sastre national pour vendre des biens publics des int r ts priv s pendant que les citoyens sont sous le choc et que leurs collectifs sont impuissants
8330836 by the way larry we feel its only fair to hand over four or five million to sharon brown with a couple extra million for her attorney
8330837 are you willing to tell the story of an average american who was merely doing her job when she was physically attacked and verbally demeaned by a powerful megastar
8330838 its like im being punished for trying to do something good
8330839 ive talked to pretty much every company i can find ive gotten quotes from people and theyre all like yeah its forty grand its ridiculous
8330840 pizza fusion is one of those scenarios where they have a small footprint restaurant
8330841 and its the same amount of work for us as for a 50 000 square foot building so unfortunately in small footprint buildings like pizza fusion you dont get that benefit of size to back you up but youre still looking at the same amount of effort to put in the paperwork
8330842 theres nothing here thats any more expensive than anywhere else
8330843 its not something ive heard of certification costs are capped at 22 500 and thats for a 500 000 square foot building so if youre looking at really high fees those are probably coming from the contractors charging a premium because of their experience in green building thats not associated with us at all honestly its just the contractors and thats unfortunate
8330844 i am very frustrated with the fact that houston is going green and companies are taking advantage of this and charging inflated prices
8330845 its just ridiculous and im sure a lot of other places are saying forget this because of the price i feel houston is missing a great opportunity
8330846 ali wong cried oh progressive reading series youre all so serious
8330847 i walked in and there was fried chicken and catfish on the menu n y
8330848 a little piece of meat in a huge plate of fries
8330849 i absolutely love coming to houston and playing the tpc course out there at the woodlands its always been a favorite of mine
8330850 but i havent hit a ball in two weeks it will be two more before my doctor says i can even think about it
8330851 it doesnt really hurt until the end of the show when they hang me then the pain just shoots up my entire left side
8330852 but theres no way around it since its part of the show so i just grit my teeth and bear it
8330853 ive always written short stories and im a big fan of the twilight zone and o henry spider is like that
8330854 and i learned how to tell stories in three minute songs by listening to chuck berry and ray davies
8330855 its funny that we can get behind fictitious serial killers but not real ones
8330856 no one sits around and goes im more of a jeffrey dahmer man than a john wayne gacy lover
8330857 alice has a certain sense of humor in what he says its poetic but theres always a veiled threat somewhere
8330858 believe it or not my daughter and i have the greatest relationship of all time
8330859 well go to a mall in the middle of a tour and she cant ever get all of the bruising makeup off of her
8330860 so it looks like shes been beaten up and people are looking at me like whos this old creepy longhaired guy and whats he doing to her
8330861 well burst out laughing at things that nobody else will find funny ill say to her at breakfast you know when i slit your throat during dead babies can you turn a little more to the left it will make the blood squirt further toward the audience and thats a normal conversation
8330862 if i didnt know better id think we were driving home after a gig in the middle of the night somewhere trying to stay awake
8330863 it was dances all these early guys were playing and writing music for
8330864 then when it became concerts where you know sit here and be stoned out of your mind and dont interact with the opposite sex like pink floyd then it wasnt about dancing
8330865 no we dont know why that fish is so pissed either
8330866 we were in front of 40 or 50 thousand people and i knew that for a majority of them possum kingdom would be the one thing that they knew of ours if that but they were into it and it felt great
8330867 the songs all had that weird something wrong with them thing that toadies songs do
8330868 i put all the toadies sounding ones on hold and i called the other guys
8330869 i kinda thought when he was first talking about it that he was gonna do a solo record and he wanted me to play a couple songs on it
8330870 when he hit me with the full on toadies record i thought ooh
8330871 i used it to my advantage because it really helped me understand what makes the band click this is the most confident thing that ive written i know how to make a surefooted record we all do we know how to do what we do and make it pop
8330872 sometimes i wish people would get a little more rowdy but they dont and that all comes with the mentality were real close to the beach and that brings a lot of skaters and surfers in here they want to have a pitcher of beer and watch the band play theyll hoot and howl but they dont get up and start mosh pits
8330873 i dont like to put signed memorabilia up if they havent played scout
8330874 ive got a guitar signed by disturbed that i keep at my house because they havent played here
8330875 and so do we doesnt matter who they are im happy to have them

8330890 the cut they call pork butt in other parts of the country
8330891 ive tried oak pecan hickory and all the other woods i like mesquite the best
8330892 ive never seen anybody wrap their meats up in cellophane before
8330893 i learned the hard way that when you wrap meat up in foil it keeps cooking
8330894 i kept throwing away all this dried out meat but when you wrap it up in cellophane it stops the cooking and keeps all the moisture trapped inside
8330895 they are made from a recipe that my mother in law gave me
8330896 well firstly i am italian my grand fathers name was ruggiero
8330897 when he came over here he changed it to rogers secondly i grew up in new jersey where theres a bakery on almost every corner
8330898 when i turned 40 my wife turned to me and said if money were no object what would you really want to do when i told her that i wanted to be a pastry chef i didnt realize that she then secretly investigated what courses were available in houston almost exactly one year later i had enrolled and graduated from the culinary institute of alain and marie len tre the week after i grad u ated i was offered a job at the houston country club
8330899 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy i still think its going to be mitt romney
8330900 hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated
8330901 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8330902 ok shes not a dynamo of fiery charisma in fact as ive noted before shes a bland and sometimes boring speaker and a pleasant if unprepossessing television presence
8330903 doordat ik vaak met en voor kinderen werk weet ik wat er bij hen leeft ik weet ook dat ze allemaal willen winnen maar ik vind het minstens even belangrijk dat ze genoeg goesting uitstralen
8330904 ik wil altijd graag meewerken om de beste kandidaat naar het songfestival te sturen en het leuke bij het junior songfestival is dat belgi daar gemiddeld veel beter scoort dan op het grotemensenfestival
8330905 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
8330906 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
8330907 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
8330908 i like young women my emphasis i think most men do
8330909 do you think theres something more to my life than my relations with young women
8330910 a lot of teams see the dynamo as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow as far as where their achievements in soccer can take them and this is a great way to connect with them
8330911 with the dynamo involved not just in the league but also with the champions league tournament were playing all over the continent right now so its hard to say who will appear and when but we will have first team squad players there
8330912 theyre doing pieces centered around different heroes and alter egos
8330913 theyre not confined to traditional definitions of that but heroes that inspired them in their lives some of them are family members or community icons and some are characters from comic books
8330914 the group has created individual and collaborative pieces taylor does photo collage they start with photos and then are built into collage but they have because of their texture a painting quality to them lance flowers uses found objects with drawing and painting robert does silk screening painting with found objects involved and lovie does primarily painting but shell also have found objects and photos it should be a nice mix of urban and edgy with some classical painting styles
8330915 im striving really hard to make people feel like theyre walking on the streets of houston when they enter the gallery
8330916 it will be transformed into a concrete jungle consisting of street signs painted walls canvases found items and television sets all tied together
8330917 time stops for no one the clock is an everyday reminder to myself that were only getting older and if you wanna get shit done gotta do it now
8330918 i have concentrated a lot of time on paintings more than prints for this show
8330919 i figure people see the prints on the streets every day but dont really get to experience much of my other work so im taking advantage of that
8330920 i was very pleased to be there with these two young americans
8330921 so i asked somebody how i could meet the players i had only been to wimbledon once but i didnt know my way around
8330922 what ball were not going to any ball we dont have any clothes for a ball were broke
8330923 i never had two women say yes so fast in my life
8330924 i love womens tennis and have always kept them high in my mind he says
8330925 i probably was writing about it when no one else was
8330926 when billie jean king played against yvonne goolagong in the final at forest hills on grass
8330927 when venus was coming along getting to the final unseeded nobody had done that before she was ranked no 66 or something like that and shes playing in the semifinals against this big romanian kid irina sp rlea and she had to save two match points to do it and they were tremendous backhand shots down the line
8330928 its funny when you say young new comers theyre all young
8330929 i met her she played well yesterday i would love to see some of our young americans do well but im delighted by the way the game is more international more international than when i started covering it
8330930 i dont know if its a new cold war but it looks like the russians are going to take over
8330931 they see the brass ring and theyre going for it
8330932 the fact is whether you knew him or not we are all lyndon baines johnsons immediate family because we were all important to him

8330989 die austria ist keine plattform mehr f r solche leute
8330990 problematisch ist auch die rivalit t zwischen einzelner fangruppen die eigentlich hinter einer mannschaft stehen sollten ich m chte aber festhalten dass bei der austria familie schock und zorn herrschen
8330991 wenn wir mit dem richtigen biss zur sache gehen dann m ssten wir dieses match gewinnen ich hoffe die mannschaft wei worum es geht es wird notwendig sein einhundert prozent zu geben

8331023 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8331024 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8331025 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8331026 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8331027 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight

8331032 they said you know we got it ok we can handle all internal threats that now exist in the anbar province but we love your marines and we want you to stay as long as you want to be here obviously we can t have it both ways
8331033 we don t announce future events as you know based on operational security and we would not want to get out in front of the government of iraq on these issues
8331034 i think it should be readily evident that the force that we needed in the anbar province in 2005 2006 to fight the insurgency at its height is not the force that we need there now to do nation building and to try to bring the government and the sunnis closer together
8331035 i m what they call a title 10 kind of guy so those really aren t my determinations to make but i do know that 25 000 marines in the province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control

8331041 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8331042 were posing the question whats changed since biden and clinton called obama not ready
8331043 this is the democrats week and were realistic about our potential impact but i think so far weve had a lot of success highlighting obamas inexperience
8331044 our superior customer service and support represent key differentiators for nitro when compared with other competitor offerings in this space
8331045 many of our clients have had painful experiences with the sales and support teams of our better known competitor for example and theyre not impressed hearing these stories only makes us more passionate about our pledge to ensure the customer always comes first and for us that means consistently providing outstanding service and support
8331046 with nitro you can be assured of direct directdeals 103 28
8331047 the way to really show we are serious about providing products to them that are useful is through software
8331048 from what i gathered it made it easier for people to find their pictures and just various programs they installed and common things they used i have no problems doing that
8331049 on top of windows vista that enhances the customer experience
8331050 you can point to apple and see what can happen when you customize your software to hardware and create a unique experience
8331051 it gave me some ideas i wouldnt have tried on my own
8331052 i thought it was cool and it was a neat little discovery to find on my computer
8331053 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8331054 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8331055 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8331056 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8331057 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8331058 my principals are but if you blackmail me ill change them
8331059 ingrid betancourt was captured by the farc during her fringe leftist 2002 presidential campaign
8331060 president nicolas sarkozys government took up the cause and paid a reported 500 000 in ransom which the farc leadership kept together with ingrid betancourt
8331061 o nce freed and safely in bogota ingrid spent less than 24 hours in her country she showed no interest in returning to colombia for the joyous celebration on july 20 of the countrys independence and the hostages release instead watching the proceedings on a giant television screen in pariss trocadero park
8331062 nearly a month since her escape the question must be asked is ingrid of paris and bogota a reincarnated joan of arc or is she suffering from stockholm syndrome it seems incredible that having endured numberless indignities by her farc captors during more than six years jungle confinement she could speak so naively

8331068 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8331069 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8331070 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8331071 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8331072 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8331073 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot

8331079 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8331080 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8331081 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8331082 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions

8331102 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica

8331104 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8331105 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8331106 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8331107 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8331109 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8331110 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8331111 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8331112 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato

8331122 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8331123 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8331124 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8331125 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8331126 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia

8331130 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8331131 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8331132 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8331133 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8331134 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8331135 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8331143 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8331144 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8331145 i think she gave a very good speech from her point of view and our point of view but not necessarily for barack obamas point of view
8331146 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8331147 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8331148 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8331149 good but not quite very good for barack obama in 2008 even better if things should turn out like they might for in 2012
8331150 what was missing was much in the way of description of barack obama what kind of man is he one who supports the same positions she does
8331151 has she looked deep into his heart and found something worthy no evidence here that she had would he be a good commander in chief not a word on that as the mccain campaign quickly and gleefully noted

8331165 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8331166 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8331167 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8331168 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8331169 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8331170 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8331171 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8331199 if those people are open to and willing to enter treatment thats when we need to get them on to methadone not six months later or even three weeks later

8331201 most people i know with opiate addictions they dont like themselves either when theyre in addiction its not a nice world

8331203 youve got the shackles of addiction and the shackles of procuring a black market drug generally its a fairly chaotic lifestyle in most areas prior to going on to treatment but that treatment generally turns that around pretty quickly

8331208 number one measure is the vigilance of the troops then we have strengthened the fence totally this year we have resuscitated it well in advance the next step was to integrate all our surveillance systems when you put all this together we have created almost an impregnable situation
8331209 they are coming in small groups we use all sensors to detect them at the earliest direction finders and optical instruments are used radio intercepts come in handy and finally all our troops are equipped with night visions on their weapons this gives us tremendous capability the fencing has really worked for us
8331210 from whatever reports ive got the situation is not under control but the state government has assured that it will soon improve

8331219 part of hillary clintons speech will be based on her thinking what am i going to do in 2012
8331220 het lijkt er op dat de verkoopdruk aan het opdrogen is er lijkt zelfs wat ruimte te komen voor een stijging al zal die niet groot zijn
8331221 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
8331222 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
8331223 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that you know senator clinton would have been on anybodys shortlist and so i took her very seriously
8331224 no meetings no conversations no requests for information no real consideration whatsoever
8331225 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8331226 both because she wants a democrat in the white house and because she does not want to be blamed if we dont have one
8331227 she wants to go above and beyond to ensure that if it doesnt happen nobody points the finger at her
8331228 shes emerged from this campaign as an even more powerful force and shes going to map out a strategy where she can make a difference in peoples lives
8331229 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8331236 a lot of people inside and outside of the clinton campaign expected her to be a very formidable and eventually a successful candidate
8331237 so she had both the benefit of and the burden of lots of expectations
8331238 have you dealt with the chance that you wont be the nominee
8331239 the idea that if you look and act like a presidential nominee then people are gonna come to think of you that way
8331240 the problem with that strategy is that its easily shattered
8331241 you know this is very personal for me its not just political its not just public i see whats happening and we have to reverse it
8331242 clinton was at her absolute best at that point clinton basically tossed her advisors overboard
8331243 the reason shes a u s senator the reason shes a candidate for president the reason she might be a front runner is her husband messed around
8331244 and from that moment forward clinton really didnt have the resources to compete in the feb 5th states the way obama did
8331245 i mean you can point to that period in february as basically having been the deciding time in the race
8331246 her message didnt match the moment the change message that barack obama had from day one was that message for this moment

8331355 it was a good days work and nice to complete so many laps its the fastest circuit of the year and so we were trying out our low downforce package which went well although it always feels strange to drive with such little downforce on the car the track was also quite green which didnt help but i was happy with the set up work we completed even though we still have a lot to learn
8331356 a solid days work with good reliability we did plenty of laps to give nelson as much running as possible with the car in low downforce trim its always quite a challenge here to set the car up as it is such a unique circuit but weve colleted lots of data from the first days running which will give us a good base to work on from here

8331469 eventually i started fashioning my own equipment and began churning out some fine quality chocolate
8331470 it is extremely hard work and takes a lot of time but boy is it beautiful when you get right

8331492 ent o voltareis e vereis a diferen a entre o justo e o mpio entre o que serve a deus e o que n o o serve porque eis que aquele dia vem ardendo como fornalha todos os soberbos e todos os que cometem impiedade ser o como a palha e o dia que est para vir os abrasar diz o senhor dos ex rcitos de sorte que lhes n o deixar nem raiz nem ramo mas para v s os que temeis o meu nome nascer o sol da justi a e cura trar nas suas asas e saireis e saltareis como bezerros da estrebaria

8331510 last week the deal was 90 percent dead but we were able to revive it the fact that it has been so quiet is a good sign
8331511 its been a lot of back and forth and skillful negotiating and to try to get each side to soften their stance if the fight was arum vs schaefer it would have been made awhile ago
8331512 he left me the messages and at the end of one of them he said thanks for all your help i read that as the fight is done
8331513 there is no more fitting way to launch a new year than to connect ourselves to these deepest commitments which connect us as a university community
8331514 the mass of the holy spirit is a great way to showcase that we are a jesuit and catholic university and that this is a university that gathers together to worship
8331515 we call down on the holy spirit to help us on special occasions like this
8331516 this gathering is not merely an accident it is the work of god
8331517 today the spirit of god gathers us from near and far to this place to this home to this alma mater for reasons we may not quite figure out now
8331518 gratitude opens us up and moves us beyond our self preoccupations and small worlds our regrets and misgivings

8331547 its good going into the playoffs to get a win like that late in the game a lot of times in the playoffs youre going to be in close games or extra innings
8331548 i think the playoffs get glamorized slightly by the major leagues
8331549 though its very important and you want to be a part of it its not always paramount to the season its a little depressing to think all these games dont have the same meaning as they could have though
8331550 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing

8331558 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8331559 but when its calvin klein and its steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8331560 i love comfort and ease i think you aussies are great at that
8331561 i like to walk by the store and have something catch my eye and then go in but i dont like to do the whole hour long im not a girl girl in that way

8331563 it is the best thing you will ever do in your life it just lights up my whole world when max laughs
8331564 being a mother just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible

8331569 we have five american films in competition and most of those films are films with stars so in a way the strike only meant that some of the bigger studio films will only be released late december or january

8331573 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
8331574 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really it was because no one bothered to follow him
8331575 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it
8331576 jennifer didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine
8331577 didnt want to waste anybodys time if somethings not right

8331581 most of the blame should go to pedro cause he shouldnt have given up 2 homers in 1inning
8331582 also its worth noting that martinez coughed up five runs in two innings in the fourth and fifth inning when the mets had a seven run lead which is very very disappointing to say the least and its worth repeating again the mets did not score a run in the final nine innings of tonights game continuing a trend that will have to change if they intend on winning this division
8331583 exactly even though its a 2 game set it practically has the significance of 4 games
8331584 wow 6 run lead pedro can afford to give up his requisite 3 4 runs over 6 innings
8331585 how do you figure this carrys the significance of 4 games

8331610 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8331611 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8331612 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8331613 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8331614 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8331615 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8331616 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8331617 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8331618 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events

8331626 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8331627 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8331628 i havent set any goals for the rest of the season
8331629 just try to get through the season injury free and go home and enjoy myself

8331678 the upshot is that after growth of about 1 2 per cent this year we now expect the uk economy to contract by about 0 2 per cent in 2009 we previously forecast growth of 0 5 per cent
8331679 this projection is well below the latest consensus forecast of 0 9 per cent
8331680 but these developments wont prevent the economy from slowing further over the next year or so
8331681 it is quite plausible that they fall even further than this
8331682 another day brings another gloomy prediction about the british economy
8331683 the brown bubble has burst and thanks to labours economic incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8331684 as a result of this new negative data consumer and business surveys consistently show that the fear of an actual recession dominates
8331685 with inflation doggedly remaining high the question remains will europe enter stagflation stagnation plus high inflation or even worse a genuine recession
8331686 this combined with renewed interest in the mining sector after yesterdays drops meant the uk index remained well supported for much of the day
8331687 a positive start by the usa has also helped keep london positive as the day has worn on the next day or so could prove key for the uk market to see if this strength is set to continue

8331731 but if we look at the seven to eight year olds a different picture emerges
8331732 i think that both genes and culture play a role
8331733 social norms of equality can come into being even without extended forms of cultural transmission
8331734 nobody would dispute that the sexual maturation of children is driven by biology and genes so why should other phenotypes like those associated with fairness behaviour not also be driven by biology and genes
8331735 in the deep ocean there is a strong interaction between viruses and prokaryotes which helps sustain the deep sea ecosystems independently of the nutrient inputs coming from the surface waters
8331736 its a sort of self sustaining mechanism helping the ocean depths to overcome severe nutrient limitations
8331737 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8331738 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8331739 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8331740 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8331741 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8331742 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8331744 one of the leading causes of foot problems from painful conditions to visible deformities are high heels and other uncomfortable footwear
8331745 since most women are unwilling to sacrifice their stylish footwear i often help them figure out how to make the necessary compromises for their lifestyle to minimize the amount of pain they suffer and prevent lasting injuries
8331746 these boots while they may be incredibly warm and water proof provide just about no arch support
8331747 my patients have been very successful both in treating and preventing plantar fasciitis as well as holding onto their boot
8331748 a bunion results when the big toe becomes misaligned and turns toward the remaining toes
8331749 the bump is actually additional bone formation and any shoe but especially high heels because they add pressure to that area with very narrow toe casings are the major culprits
8331750 women are accustomed to wearing high heels that grip the foot at the toe and at the ankle and the newer styles that sheath the foot add pressure where they arent used to feeling it
8331751 it causes everything from subtle discomfort to major pain as the muscles below the arch are strained when women instinctively try to stretch the fabric by extending their foot even more
8331752 the pressure that the heel and the small opening put on the toes causes the nail to grow abnormally
8331753 fungal infections thrive in the presence of ingrown toenails and the pain can become very severe

8331756 reflect a significant body of science showing that bpa may play a larger role than previously thought in a host of common health problems including prostate cancer breast cancer and early puberty
8331757 more research is needed to better understand bpas implications for human health
8331758 however because these effects in animals occur at bisphenol a exposure levels similar to those experienced by humans the possibility that bisphenol a may alter human development cannot be dismissed
8331759 the bottom line is there really is a convergence of opinion that is occurring

8331773 for the two days i was on the road i only heard snatches of reports about the war but what i ultimately saw was not at all what i had expected to see
8331774 there were russian tanks on the main highway connecting tbilisi with the countrys west we could not proceed on our way and it also transpired that the russians had blown up the railway
8331775 what kind of independence are they talking about when there are only 45 000 people living in abkhazia and 15 000 in south ossetia
8331776 russia will fall victim to its own moves as they are sure to lead to instability in russia

8331869 hvis det st rste problem er at skaffe arbejdskraft og vi har en jobplan fra for ret hvor man siger at t af de steder man f rst skal tage fat det er i forhold til sygefrav ret og regeringen har lavet en handlingsplan s beh ver vi jo ikke sande hele diskussionen til med et langt langt sk nderi mellem os om efterl n og dagpenge
8331870 n r vi snakker efterl n og arbejdsudbud s tror jeg at problemet er politisk mere end det er konomisk man har jo lige lavet et efterl nsforlig s derfor tror jeg at opgaven med at f et forlig p det her er lig nul
8331871 det han foretager sig er det som vi har lavet et forlig for at undg jeg ved ikke om det er med opbakning fra regeringen eller hvad men han skaber igen maksimal usikkerhed hos den enkelte l nmodtager og det vil vi ikke v re med til hvis nogen bner for den diskussion har man brudt velf rdsforligets aftale om efterl n

8331901 ordenes del presidente y la primera dama haremos lo que el presidente diga
8331902 we strongly object to all cases of racism and violence we hold educational programs aiming to encourage coexistence and a dialogue among the different sectors of society in the city
8331903 lord you know better than i know myself that i am getting older and will someday be old keep me from getting talkative and particularly from the fatal habit of thinking that i must say something on every subject and on every occasion
8331904 when i was woven together in the depths of the earth your eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be
8331905 he tends his flock like a shepherd he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart he gently leads those that have young
8331906 she gracefully marked her place as one of americas premiere politicians with a firm commanding gracious argument on behalf of barack obama
8331907 shes clearly hesitant about the prospect of him as president
8331908 the chance that shell deliver an off message speech like pat buchanan in 1988 or give obama the cold shoulder like kennedy did to carter in 1980 is exceedingly slim
8331909 clear flat assertion that obama is qualified and prepared to be commander in chief from day one
8331910 or were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8331911 behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there anything too hard for me

8331913 walaupun ia kawasan pilihan raya kecil ia mungkin menjadi satu trend di mana pengundi sudah buat pemikiran hendak perubahan walaupun mereka tidak tahu apa perubahan itu dan tidak menerima pimpinan bn
8331914 ini jelas bahawa kita perlu buat satu perubahan cepat corak daya dan perubahan organisasi kita dan cara kita
8331915 satu yang lebih adil yang tidak berasaskan perkauman yang berdasarkan profil rakyat malaysia yang berbagai bangsa dan agama umno perlu bersedia buat perubahan
8331916 mungkin apa pun yang dikatakan tentang anwar orang tak percaya dan pengundi tak percaya penjelasan yang dibawa oleh pemimpin kita tak diterima seolah olah keputusan yang dibuat awal awal yang mengatakan bn barisan nasional tak akan menang dan pkr akan tahan mempertahankan kawasan itu
8331917 kita dapati pengundi pengundi di atas pagar belum dapat dipengaruhi oleh umno terutama pengundi pengundi dari golongan muda
8331918 the deafness thing i will find some funky quirky way to make it work for me
8331919 to be the person in the family where they are like wow shes deaf but she does it so well
8331920 im like ok i have this disease that i cant pronounce and i dont really understand it
8331921 to me the diagnosis was pretty much a kick in the gut
8331922 i want to crawl up and cry and i cant i cant do it because she doesnt do it
8331923 she is not physically capable of having committed those acts
8331924 this whole ordeal has taken a very negative effect on her emotionally and physically
8331925 she wants this to be over she wants to be vindicated
8331926 franchement je ne vois pas du tout comment a marche
8331927 jumlah undi yang diperolehi bn kurang daripada bilangan ahli ahli umno di kawasan parlimen itu
8331928 mustahil untuk disembunyikan beliau tidak memiliki lagi sekelumit kewibawaan yang perlu untuk mentadbir negara dari hari ke hari apatah lagi mengatur arah baru yang kita semua perlukan untuk maju dalam dunia yang kompleks
8331929 saya menyeru ahli ahli umno dan parti parti komponen bn sentiasa bersama dengan parti dalam saat dilanda krisis ini dan mengambil perspektif sejarah secara tenang
8331930 if those nascar guys wore expensive suites and hired call girls on line and had sex in airport bathrooms theyd be in office or rnc party officers by now
8331931 wine in a paper bag at breakfast just what i needed
8331932 hey thats the way we do it in snohomish county but we have some class at least he didnt bring you the wine with the screw top its got a cork right
8331933 calon bn baik tetapi kalau beliau menang maka datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi akan dakwa yang dirinya menang dakwa yang sokongan kepada bn iaitu pada dirinya sudah kembali dakwa bn telah dipulihkan dibawah kepimpinannya
8331934 saya percaya dengan berat hati penyokong penyokong bn telah undi pkr supaya abdullah akan sedar yang kepimpinannya tidak dikehendaki lagi
8331935 calon yang diletak sesuai juga apakah yang tidak kena dengan bn mungkin inilah mesej yang ingin dihantar oleh pengundi bahawa rakyat menolak kepimpinan abdullah
8331936 namun mesej yang hendak dihantar oleh pengundi melayu cina dan india menjadi sia sia kerana abdullah tidak ada telinga untuk mendengar dan tidak ada mata untuk melihat
8331937 pilihan bagi umno hanya dua setia kepada abdullah dan kalah dalam pilihanraya umum ke 13 atau setia kepada umno lebih daripada setia kepada abdullah dengan kemungkinan menang pilihan raya umum ke 13
8331938 untuk menang calon umno perlukan undi orang bukan ahli parti serta orang cina dan india
8331939 dalam keadaan sekarang iaitu umno dan kerajaan yang dipimpin oleh abdullah tidak mungkin orang bukan daripada umno akan beri kemenangan kepada calon umno atau bn

8331941 they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8331942 i have to thank you for your web site its an amazing resource
8331943 fires are very rare but we still do fire drills all the time why shouldnt we train our kids about what they can do to survive an active shooter situation
8331944 we are a very safety conscious university now in any shooting the students are the first ones in the firing line however quickly law enforcement arrives so by showing students this video we are giving them a visual idea about what might happen and how to react when it does
8331945 if you look at virginia tech most of the shootings took place in a second floor classroom with windows the shooter came in shot a couple of people and then left he came back later and killed more of them if they had been thinking about their options properly they might very well have decided to climb out of the window
8331946 the difference between trained and untrained people in a crisis situation is that untrained ones will panic and maybe huddle together for support but if they were acting logically they might realise that if you have one gunman in a room full of 200 people the odds are very much in the favour of the 200 people
8331947 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8331948 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar and to sport the warning signs or red flags that mean a student is about to commit an act of violence some schools say it has changed their entire culture
8331949 its a terrible terrible idea something that everybody within the violence prevention profession should recoil against if you put a video programme like this out there it becomes just another thing for young people to copy it will produce what people call behaviour contagion become a training manual for violence
8331950 cela a t assur ment une ann e difficile mais racheter un partenaire nest jamais une chose facile

8331958 the boy oageng mogale was in his home yard when the tiger pounced on him his father rushed to assist him but the animal attacked him too
8331959 while busy searching the tiger emerged from the trees and pounced on the police officers
8331960 one of the cops fired shots from his rifle and the tiger diverted its attention to a police reservist who also fired a shot from his gun
8331961 a reservist was shot twice in the leg by diverted ammunition
8331962 four males entered this shop at about 5 25pm and held staff and customers at gunpoint
8331963 it is clear that certain legal challenges specifically with regard to the constitutionality of certain clauses could not be resolved between the legal advisers of the department of public works and the parliamentary legal advisers in time
8331964 in the agricultural sector it is critical that confidence in the sector is re established in order to draw investment into the sector to ensure increased production
8331965 microbiology tells us that bacterial populations are heterogeneous individual bacteria differ from one another molecular biology tells us that some bacteria have molecular mechanisms by which they can survive antibiotics molecular genetics tells us how these resistance mechanisms are passed to other bacteria and through generations of bacteria pharmacology helps us design new antibiotics that circumvent the bacterial defenses what does darwinism add to the sciences of microbiology molecular biology molecular genetics and pharmacology darwinism tells us that antibiotic resistant bacteria survive exposure to antibiotics because of natural selection that is bacteria survive antibiotics that theyre not sensitive to so non killed bacteria will eventually outnumber killed bacteria thats it
8331966 of course our co2 is not to blame after all its such a small part of the air
8331967 its all the suns fault anyway so theres nothing we can do about it
8331968 i dont think the need for action is that urgent
8331969 i see paranoia on this shouldnt we concentrate more on alternative energy sources
8331970 i dont totally trust the ipcc as a purely scientific body at least not in wgii or wgiii maters
8331971 i doubt the degree of warming that is anthropogenic is as high as claimed
8331972 the high degree of confidence of the cause effect of co2 to warming is perhaps overstated
8331973 i think the ipcc is overestimating things in their projections
8331974 we really dont fully understand the degree to which water in clouds as a solid is responsible for the heat increase and should study it more
8331975 stratospheric changes of h2o in the tropopause region might be a forcing and additional measurements and analyses are clearly needed to explain the observed trends
8331976 everyone keeps talking mostly about greenhouse gasses why not more about land use change the other factor in human induced climate change
8331977 water vapor is not a greenhouse gas and it doesnt absorb infrared nor solar short wave radiation
8331978 but theres a virtually inexhaustible list of complex interactions some of which are poorly known or perhaps even unknown
8331979 pah we are done with you kindly relegate your metareligious quasithinking into your own pit of abject despair over there in the dark corner of the middle ages
8331980 even a 5 degree c rise can be a disaster look here and here and here

8332055 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8332056 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8332057 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

8332074 esses encontros tendem a pautar a es com foco na sustentabilidade no que diz respeito s entidades de ensino superior
8332075 para mim isso foi uma valida o da proposta do global forum que foi promover uma reflex o do tema no mbito do ensino superior especialmente no que diz respeito aos cursos voltados para neg cios
8332076 a universidade o ponto cardeal no processo o ponto de alavancagem na quest o da educa o ao capacitar os profissionais do ensino superior haver certamente uma reflex o nos demais ciclos de ensino pois os professores s o formados nas universidades que s o consideradas pontos de impacto sist mico ancorado nesse crit rio de educar e inovar na sustentabilidade as vantagens ser o vistas no ensino b sico fundamental e m dio

8332082 para isso mudar a consci ncia dos empreendedores e das escolas de neg cios fundamental precisamos de uma nova vis o de neg cios para o s culo xxi afinal nenhum problema pode ser resolvido com o mesmo potencial que o criou
8332083 nessa vis o de intimidade o brasil tem muito a ensinar tem um dom colaborativo e criativo n o existem limites para a inova o humana por isso investir nesses jovens que est o no ensino superior fundamental
8332084 temos que aprender com a inova o e contar com a criatividade n o podemos por exemplo aprender com a extin o de esp cies

8332116 by bringing the last night of the convention out to the people we will be able to showcase barack obamas positive people centered vision for our country in a big way
8332117 first and foremost were daily walk throughs with seemingly every person from the dnc the secret service the media and many other entities that play a role in planning the logistics for the event the plans had to come together really quickly just because of the short time frame so during all those walk throughs decisions were being made very quickly
8332118 there are over 5 000 plus media that are actually coming tomorrow to the event and so we had to create significant numbers of additional spaces in the stadium to accommodate them
8332119 we really tried to use as much as possible our broncos operational game plan as crazy as that sounds
8332120 were obviously not talking anything related to football but how we operate the stadium how we separate suite levels from premium levels how we move people from the gates to the upper concourse because of such a short time frame we really tried to keep things as simple as possible
8332121 one thing that weve really been focusing on is we really dont want to reinvent the wheel we want to try and have the stadium operate in the same general way that we do for broncos games obviously thats not 100 percent possible just because the events so unique but we use that as the foundation and just try to make changes as needed
8332122 it will be a relief when were done with cu csu football on sunday
8332123 when this is over we immediately have to get the stadium ready for the football game getting the field ready and thats going to be a 24 hour a day process until were through with that

8332130 bullish u s durable goods data solid oil inventory numbers and the fact that crude had already started to retreat from session highs as hurricane gustav was downgraded to a tropical storm have all combined to ensure the dollar can resume its upward trend
8332131 the city was moving away from its traditional image of white heterosexual and male which puts off many gay and lesbian applicants and as a result the proportion of gay and lesbian workers began to increase but it looks as though progress has stalled
8332132 more of the older generation will identify themselves as gay once city workers reach a certain level in an organisation they feel confident enough to do so but fewer young gay people are prepared to identify themselves as such its about feeling secure in your workplace
8332133 the credit crunch has made people feel less secure hence the falling numbers

8332139 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8332140 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8332141 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8332142 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8332143 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8332144 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8332149 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8332150 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8332151 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8332152 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8332162 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8332163 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8332164 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8332165 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8332166 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8332167 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8332168 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8332172 if you let a videogame designer design a serious game it will be statistically invalid from a behavioral and cognitive science standpoint but if you let an instructional designer design it will be a pile of doggy doo
8332173 this collision of minds and attitudes threatens to derail the growth of the seriously game market the entertainment people dont think that the learning guys understand what it takes to make a truly effective videogame training folks educators academics and public sector employees very often tend to stereotype the gaming guys as nerds with poor communication and social skills
8332174 the typical game development cycle involves a period of checking out what other developers recently have done to inform our game design
8332175 this is an invaluable tool that automatically authors a detailed game design document in as little as five minutes once we have set a few parameters such as genre budget and sequel number obviously this needs acceptance from the publisher but as they have probably determined all the design parameters in the first place they usually say yes and then change things later on several times
8332176 the usual team consists of some nerds who dream of c sub routines all night some smelly creative guys with tattoos and long beards that make 3d characters with big breasts underwear big guns and space ships and the suit guys who tell everyone what to do and talk about deadlines and dollars all day long we dont pay too much attention to them usually they go away if we ignore them for long enough
8332177 there are only three games you need to know to know anything about in order to be able to understand world class game design the sims civilisation and grand theft auto id suggest that any budding seriously game designer who doesnt have a game industry background play these games for at least an hour or so in order to grasp the basics of great cross genre educationally valid gameplay mechanics
8332178 a typical game developers day is quite challenging we need to play about a dozen different games a day to ensure that we are up to speed with current best practice as you need to know what you need to copy for your next sequel we usually do this in the comfy room basically a large colourful space kitted out with refrigerators massive sound systems high def tvs game consoles game magazines large padded cushions and of course a pool table for when we need to chill out
8332179 the crunch period is quite a stressful period for us that is when we push run on the and watch carefully whilst it automatically creates our latest title obviously it wont be totally bug free and we will need to have a couple of people test if a few times before we ftp the finished files off to the publisher and start chasing our last five milestone payments
8332180 the most important thing i would suggest in any serious game project whether it is aimed at fighter pilots politicians surgeons or fire fighters is to make it fun
8332181 a game must be fun even if that means making the physics scenario or narrative unrealistic you cannot let the mundane realities of real life make the experience boring a serious game that for example allows military strategists to plan a successful atomic warfare campaign should make the user laugh and cry otherwise i would question its real effectiveness
8332182 omg how could anyone ever be seen in that tight fitting spandex suit without even feeling the least bit orbiang

8332189 un errore insistere sulla reciprocit in senso matematico non si possono imporre democrazia e diritti come li conosciamo noi perch sono frutto di un percorso che non detto sia quello che devono fare gli emirati arabi
8332190 non possiamo prescindere dal dialogo interreligioso continua e in questo dialogo dobbiamo rifarci alla nostra tradizione in cui luomo per la sua dignit uguale davanti a dio su questa base si pu chiedere che sia permesso alle migliaia di stranieri che lavorando hanno prodotto il miracolo economico di questi paesi di esercitare liberamente e pubblicamente il proprio credo
8332191 aspiro ad avere la possibilit di costruire chiese nella mia diocesi ed a maggiore libert ma tutto ci deve essere risolto e perseguito nella comprensione reciproca e nella convinzione che dio stende sempre la sua mano e ci protegge ed dunque necessario guardare a lui

8332200 le imprese italiane si muovono secondo i mercati ora i mercati che si stanno aprendo sono quelli dove il made in italy comincia ad affermarsi sono quindi i mercati dove comincia a crescere il livello di sviluppo e di ricchezza delle persone questo vuol dire i mercati delleuropa delleuropa vicina ma soprattutto quelli dellestremo oriente
8332201 no ormai le imprese italiane hanno imparato ad andare allestero anche le pi piccole e chiaro che chi si affaccia sa che corre dei rischi per sono pi attrezzate anche culturalmente per farlo
8332202 gli stranieri hanno difficolt ad investire in un paese in cui le regole sono spesso state cambiate senza preavvertire chi aveva iniziato gli investimenti in cui ci sono delle difficolt in cui ci sono delle aree del paese che sono state e sono ancora nelle mani della illegalit se non si risolvono questi nodi sar difficile che ci sia una inversione di tendenza
8332203 senza italia non si fa europa o almeno non si fa leuropa che abbiamo immaginato e che hanno immaginato i nostri padri al di l della seconda guerra mondiale litalia tra i costituenti deuropa
8332204 un imprenditore che ha le risorse le investe quando ha un progetto su cui fare affidamento per fare affidamento non conta solo la bont del progetto ma anche il contesto il contesto pu aiutare o meno linvestimento mi sembra che da qualche anno in italia si stia respirando un aria nella quale si possa puntare sugli investimenti perch comincia a ricrescere la fiducia nel futuro nonostante le crisi dei mesi scorsi si siano ribaltate anche sul nostro paese e nonostante questo mi sembra che la fiducia sia in crescita
8332205 molto positivo per noi italiani che viviamo allestero e anche per il paese
8332206 mi fa piacere che si sia ristabilito un contatto con la piu grande compagnia mondiale che lair france

8332208 ci hanno lasciato due disastri napoli e lalitalia il primo berlusconi lo ha risolto a fine luglio domani risolvera alitalia
8332209 una situazione veramente scandalosa commenta a caldo si ripropone in modo estremamente pi negativo quella che era la situazione che si era giunti a contrattare in marzo con il governo prodi trovo che sia non soltanto una farsa ma una situazione totalmente negativa proprio per il contribuente italiano
8332210 una farsa perch si sarebbero potuti risparmiare al contribuente italiano milioni e milioni perch la situazione che viene proposta adesso la stessa che si era riusciti a patteggiare in marzo con la air france con la differenza pero che i costi sono aumentati terribilmente e tra laltro anche gli esuberi di personale sono maggiori rispetto a quelli a cui si era arrivati a marzo il fatto della cordata italiana che sembrava essere in qualche modo lobiettivo per il quale berlusconi a suo tempo rifiutava laccordo con lair france in realt soltanto di apparenza perch pi che probabile che in realt la gestione dellazienda passer poi alle mani di air france quindi una farsa un vero e proprio imbroglio
8332211 si ritorna al passato si son persi quattro mesi anche cinque ma mi fa molto piacere che si sia ristabilito un contatto con la piu grande compagnia mondiale che lair france e naturalmente spero che tutto vada a buon fine sembra che gli esuberi siano molto di pi di quanto si supponesse qualche mese fa quando il governo prodi decise di accettare laccordo con lair france e naturalmente la questione della difesa del personale oltremodo qualificato va salvaguardata vedremo seguo tutto con molta preoccupazione ma anche con un po di fiducia dovuta al fatto che si profila un accordo con air france e questo mi fa pensare che il futuro di alitalia possa essere meno nero di quanto non pensassi
8332212 come si era detto in campagna elettorale il presidente berlusconi riuscito a mettere in piedi il gruppo di investitori per lanciare la nuova alitalia e una cosa molto positiva per noi italiani che viviamo allestero e anche per il paese

8332216 the bond market is now thinking that perhaps the economy is not as weak as it had thought

8332218 if oil prices would go up that would mean the consumer would have less money to spend on other items and that would weaken the economy

8332241 a growing number of people are demanding more from the businesses that produce and sell the goods they buy not only do they feel they have the right to a high quality product they want to know that the company they buy from is transparent and honest about how those goods reach the shelves
8332242 they want the story behind the product that assures them that the company has treated its suppliers fairly and that it has done its best to take into account its impact on the environment and that perhaps someone has actually benefited from the manufacture of that product
8332243 the retail world is going to have to take notice of this powerful group of consumers if they respond to the expectations of the eco shopper everyone will benefit customers suppliers the planet and the businesses themselves it is a win win for everyone

8332257 should u s taxpayer money go to places like africa to fund contraception to prevent aids
8332258 well i think its a combination the guy i really respect on this is dr coburn he believes and i was just reading the thing he wrote that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity where that doesnt succeed than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well but i agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence i look to people like dr coburn im not very wise on it
8332259 so no contraception no counseling on contraception just abstinence do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of hiv

8332264 while we cannot predict at this point how long this outbreak will continue we believe we have prevented the spread of any further cases that may have been connected to eating at country cottage at locust grove ok

8332325 while customers are already familiar with ninjaprobes wire speed traffic capture capabilities our addition of synchronized traffic replay even across multiple probes adds a new dimension to network monitoring and trouble shooting
8332326 after precisely time stamping every captured packet ninjaprobe can now accurately replay stored data while maintaining inter packet delay intervals guaranteeing recreation of the originally monitored traffic
8332327 high volume data storage coupled to accurate data replay is the equivalent of network cctv giving operators the reassurance that they can readily share a previous user experience and quickly isolate issues that might be impacting network performance

8332331 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8332332 gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8332333 they made a very general claim that you can see the internet in its entirety and actually thats not quite true

8332337 embraces the forced confession of a 9 11 suspect elicited through 5 years of hideous torture in the confines of secret prisons
8332338 being a propaganda vehicle for a cia program to discredit the suspect while he stands trial based on confessions obtained through torture
8332339 from beginning to end the article categorically states that the principle defendant khaled sheikh mohammed is the self confessed mastermind of the september 11 attacks on the us
8332340 the fts embrace of the cia and militarys coerced evidence and therefore their use of torture puts them squarely in the camp of the totalitarian state
8332341 mr mohammed was an isi asset indeed anyone who is handed over by the isi these days is almost certainly a former or present employee of the pakistani agency whose control of taliban operatives amazed even the pakistani government during the years before 2001 mr pearl it should be remembered arranged his fatal assignation in karachi on a mobile phone from an isi office
8332342 ever since the frenzied shootout last month on september 11 2002 in karachi there have been doubts over whether khalid shaikh mohammed the self proclaimed head of military committee died in the police raid on his apartment
8332343 now it has emerged that kuwaiti national khalid shaikh mohammed did indeed perish in the raid but his wife and child were taken from the apartment and handed over to the federal bureau of investigation fbi in whose hands they remain
8332344 the person making the confession in the secret military tribunal in cuba can barely speak english

8332370 dont worry im alright im just not going to get any more sleep tonight
8332371 why havent we shipped him back to earth in a packing crate yet
8332372 ill add it to the list of things to do when we have a quiet day even if the sgc sends him back itll be hilarious
8332373 welcome to atlantis as you probably know im lieutenant colonel john sheppard and im in charge of everything military here as well as being second in command to dr weir id just like to remind you that dr weir is in charge overall for you people who hadnt worked under a civilian before that means that yes you do follow her orders even if she wants you to get her coffee
8332374 we do things differently here than most other military bases im a pretty relaxed co in most things so if follow your orders and listen to the veterans here we wont have any problems
8332375 this is the enemy its called a wraith the pegasus galaxys version of a vampire they feed by sucking the life force of a human out of their body through glands in their hands depending on how much it feeds the victim can be aged to the point of death after a wraith feeds its strength and regenerative capabilities is increases if youve got a recently fed wraith you better have extra clips
8332376 youll have the chance to get familiar with some of the wraith weaponry later in the afternoon
8332377 well mostly you guys are going to be providing security here on atlantis as well as being reinforcements when the shit hits the fan off atlantis if youre lucky you might be chosen for a stargate team
8332378 this is a wraith stunning weapon they use these to bring in their prey with the least amount of effort they paralyze the stunned person so they can be brought aboard the hive ship to be fed upon it takes some time for the paralysis to wear off after youve woken up from being stunned well be going over using these more in the coming days but i thought youd like to try them out today
8332379 some cant shoot stunners worth shit but well work on that whats up
8332380 i was just curious to see if you had decided to send any back yet
8332381 ive got to get to the control room youre in charge here supervise a little more practice then hand out both room and security team assignments take them to the mess after that the lists are on that pc on the table keep an eye on them will you
8332382 alright everyone im major evan lorne 2ic to colonel sheppard ive got your room assignments all the new arrivals are going to be in the same area even if youre in different fields but ill go over those in a second
8332383 okay first order of business now that colonel sheppards not in the room the unwritten rules of atlantis and the pegasus galaxy
8332384 number one dont get between the scientists and their coffee most of the time they need it to stay awake while figuring out how to keep us alive so if theres one cup left give it to a scientist
8332385 number two dont tease the scientists theyre the ones who maintain everything here and can get their revenge creatively if you do prank the scientists
8332386 because youre going to want to youd better be at least two hundred percent sure it cant be traced back to you theyll find out
8332387 rule number three applies to you five dont advertise the fact that you have the ata gene the scientists will want to use you as a light switch and colonel sheppard will offer your services to them so he doesnt have to do it himself
8332388 the city of atlantis is sentient if you want to have for example hot water dont insult her she controls everything technological here and shell make it known if she doesnt like you
8332389 if you ask her to do something she might do it but the only one she listens to is colonel sheppard
8332390 colonel sheppard is bonded to atlantis i dont know the extent of their bond but i do know that he could communicate with atlantis from as far away from the city as earth
8332391 anyways the last rule pay attention to this one folks for the love of any god goddess or supreme being that there might be dont touch anything if you dont know what it does i dont want to be scraping up your remains when youre blown to hell by a disguised weapon or having to replace you if youre killed by a virus hidden in an artifact
8332392 major jordan and his team arent back yet theyre the ones sent to m9x 288
8332393 at his last check in the major didnt say anything was wrong but theyre overdue for their return weve dialed the gate and cant reach them on radio i hate to drag you away from your new soldiers
8332394 let me know if you hear anything from major jordans team
8332395 ill get major lorne to round up some marines for you oh and john
8332396 radek radioed me wondered if we could get him out of the lab for a while say its a team thing
8332397 gear up and meet me in the gate room as soon as possible
8332398 major jordans team is way overdue and we havent heard anything
8332399 i think ill just lay here for a minute sir
8332400 then you should stop falling for it i could hear you all the way down at the transporter whatd that one do to earn that
8332401 the same board you were up until three am four nights in a row working on
8332402 whats up normally i cant get you down to a lab unless i promise theres either turkey sandwiches or any dvds we havent seen yet
8332403 major jordans team is a day overdue elizabeth wants us to go check it out get suited up and pass the rookies to radek
8332404 alright but i get to choose the next movie after armageddon then
8332405 and women would do anything for him you should have heard the tales some of the more experienced soldiers were telling one story was how he single handedly defeated an entire genii invasion force when a hurricane was threatening atlantis we got interrupted before sgt stackhouse could continue sheppard seems like a good co
8332406 i think ill like working with dr beckett he seems very nice much better than some of the other cmos ive had to work with hes got the best scottish accent
8332407 im glad you two like your bosses dr mckay probably hit a world record decibel level with his shouting today richard wythe brushed up against one of the whiteboards in his lab and mckay went ballistic shouted for fifteen minutes before he was interrupted i really hope im going to be working under dr zelenka
8332408 he seems so im surprised how nobodys killed him yet how he got onto the flagship team and everyones put up with him is beyond me
8332409 alright weve got a wee bit of an emergency so lets get back to the infirmary and youll see how we do things here
8332410 the day you can get colonel sheppards team to leave when one of them is in the infirmary is the day you get a one million dollar bonus theyre all too damn stubborn
8332411 pretty much a standard search and rescue we arrived in the village about a kilometer from the stargate we got sgt canning on the radio he was the only one who still had his and he told us they were being held in a pit near the tree line in their city
8332412 we snuck in and stunned the guards with wraith stunners unfortunately we were doing a jailbreak a couple of minutes before the first set of guards were going to be relieved the colonel and ronon had just hauled the last member of the pit and the replacements arrived
8332413 the new guards sounded the alarm we bolted for the gate and sheppard got hit with the first volley he was covering our rear
8332414 the bastard shoved me out of the way of one of the bolts
8332415 we got to the gate dialed while sheppard tried not to pass out on us and we held off the natives after we dialed we got back here and you know the rest
8332416 well the colonel is an incredibly lucky lad the arrow i was worried about just barely missed his right lung hes got two broken ribs from the arrows in his chest but that seems to be all we removed the arrows and patched him back up we had a bit of a bleeder the arrow nicked an artery but we closed that quick enough
8332417 the operating room needs a bit of a scrub dont get rid of the arrowheads we pulled from the colonel he normally hangs onto anything he was shot with god knows why
8332418 get the colonel into some scrub bottoms get him cleaned up as well the rest of you ive got a closet of drugs that needs to be inventoried and organized dr biro can you show them the supply lists
8332419 im going to keep the colonel overnight if you go in on his escape attempts rodney im going to chain you to a bed the next time youre in here i should do the same to him
8332420 the emergency was colonel sheppards team coming back from a rescue mission colonel sheppard is in the infirmary but hell be fine but youll never guess what i found out while i was there
8332421 i was told by dr beckett to change him into some scrubs after his surgery he came back from a mission looking like a porcupine with seven arrows in him and i saw his brigade tattoo i took a closer look and hes got the same scars that i remember including the mark from the basilisk fang and wounds i healed did either of you have an idea that harry was going to be here
8332422 i knew that one of our group was going to be here the secretary of magic gave me a letter to pass on but he didnt tell me who to give it to all the man said was that id know who to deliver the letter to
8332423 yeah the colonel will be fine dr beckett was worried about a possible punctured lung but it turns out he barely avoided that he just had a couple of broken ribs and the seven arrow wounds
8332424 ty cannon of ucla s announcement of a 14 6 million grant from nih for research continuing from work seeded with staglin funds and these leveraged grants are another example of the importance of private funding in an era of decreasing public research funding we now have two categories of funds to track both direct and leveraged gifts
8332425 weve always realized how important this type of unrestricted funding is to assist these doctors and scientists with their research we hope that our approach of venture philanthropy will inspire more to do the same
8332426 most of our investment is in late stage well developed research projects that have enough preliminary data to pass peer review but we also need early phase studies that may be powered by an innovative idea but lack preliminary data and we recognize these studies will be vital for future breakthroughs in mental health fortunately the critical need for funding these early phase studies is being filled by philanthropic organizations such as the staglin foundation
8332427 its nice to know youre going against the best so theres no surprises when you get on the ice playing against a different team
8332428 i hear hes awesome a big guy a lot of fun and obviously skilled so he can teach me a few things
8332429 if one of us didnt theres no reason to pursue this
8332430 trata a los dem s como quieres que te traten a t
8332431 no no estamos tratando mal a los detractores pero ustedes son una partida de hijuenosequ y no tienen derecho a meterse con nuestra diosa coronada del gore porque tenemos raz n y punto
8332432 love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no records of wrongs
8332433 real madrid that would be handy i think everyone at celtic would like to get real madrid
8332434 the proof that terrorist groups are cornered by our security forces
8332435 algerian blood is being spilled in the name of foreign criminal interests
8332436 im not going to be able to vote for anyone who doesnt take a 100 percent stand against abortion
8332437 i think most churches would say theres a great moral suasion behind it
8332438 in christianity for example as nervous as they might be about any particular civil order the new testament does say government was created by god most churches would say yes get out tuesday get out and vote
8332439 render unto god the things that are gods and render unto caesar the things that are caesars
8332440 part of being a citizen in a society like ours where we have the privilege of voting is the responsibility to exercise that privilege
8332441 to not do so is to sort of forego that part of what it means to be in a free society and i think it would be unfortunate
8332442 if you dont allow for situations like abstaining than you basically make the earthly political order into a kind of god the earthly political order is a good
8332443 i know he gave up the vice captaincy a little while ago because there were a few issues there and there probably still are a few issues
8332444 but if its as a stand in and an emergency i dont think he will say no to helping the team out
8332445 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8332446 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again
8332447 it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that
8332448 theres no reason why we cant change momentum its going to take a massive effort from the senior players but its an opportunity for us to stand up and be counted

8332465 the technologys advanced so rapidly and there hasnt been really any debate in the public arena
8332466 the public and consumers should have an active role in deciding the boundaries beyond which society shall not go
8332467 maximal access to maximal data is very useful in healthcare
8332468 we were pretty pissed off to discover the information we had supplied found its way to a jail cell in mt eden

8332472 we believe we are strongly placed to deliver this much needed infrastructure
8332473 we estimate that to build a significant fibre optic network covering the auckland region would cost more than 1 billion
8332474 this is clearly a significant investment and one that could take shape in a number of different ways depending on the nature and structure of broadband investment funds proposed this option will remain a key area of focus for us
8332475 we understand those assets and we are assessing our options in that space
8332476 i think its also important to note that we have a share buyback in place and that provides a valuable investment option for us
8332477 the word towelhead is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8332478 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse
8332479 i think cairs objections could be remedied by simply watching the movie
8332480 wow theyre using such an unacceptable word in a movie title i wonder why
8332481 what if the characters were talking about going full jew instead of full retard
8332482 i know he gave up the vice captaincy a little while ago because there were a few issues there and there probably still are a few issues
8332483 but if its as a stand in and an emergency i dont think he will say no to helping the team out
8332484 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8332485 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again
8332486 it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that
8332487 theres no reason why we cant change momentum its going to take a massive effort from the senior players but its an opportunity for us to stand up and be counted
8332488 halt demon i am les theidrin im am a paladin sent to cleanse the world of you
8332489 i know what youve come to do but your mistaken good knight for i am no demon

8332492 listen to me les theidrin i am not your enemy i could have killed you any instant i am no demon look upon my face and see what i truly am
8332493 venga hermanas que tenemos que encontrar a estos dos mozalbetes
8332494 when my husband and i pursued this pregnancy it was another child we desired not a particular gender
8332495 if having all these boys has taught me anything its that you dont need to switch gender to get variety
8332496 if you only focus on what you dont have you forget about what you do have
8332497 weve studied the tapes from the titans and what he did at north carolina state byu and usc
8332498 well just have to adjust to what hes doing during the game after seeing how he is attacking us
8332499 you have to look at san diego state film and junior college film you have to look at several different teams to see what you think they are doing offensively and you have to look at ucla film for personnel its a little bit different
8332500 were one of those teams that has to go to a lot of places to recruit it helps us on the west coast its a chance to play a high profile game and hopefully win
8332501 el pueblo est muy sucio porque el alcalde se gasta el dinero del ayuntamiento en otras cosas menos importantes que mantener limpia nuestra bonita villa

8332504 the charge is killing this profession now every time someone quits hes under suspicion this racer told us he must have eaten some bad fish that same day ten racers quit and each said hed eaten bad fish contrary to popular belief doping doesnt give you extra strength it simply suppresses the pain the doped up athlete no longer knows his limits hes nothing more than a pedaling machine
8332505 both you and a poor person might consume rice every day but you would consume a much higher quality of rice than a poor person who would eat coarse rice
8332506 the report shows that if you have a 10 percent increase in say cereal prices the number of poor would go up by 36 million almost immediately if on the other hand food prices went up this is going from cereals to food it would increase by about 85 million people
8332507 sometimes i felt like i couldnt see or hear anything id walk past someone and if they were laughing i felt like they were laughing at me
8332508 she had such a hard time speaking it was almost to the point that she was catatonic
8332509 definitive evidence that schizophrenia is a brain disease and that it involves more than genetic susceptibility
8332510 you start with two brains that are genetically identical without a genetic control any differences you see may be due to random variation in peoples brains
8332511 the larger ventricles in those with schizophrenia implies that there is missing tissue somewhere in the brain and that it has been replaced by cerebrospinal fluid
8332512 the widening suggests atrophy or a failure of brain cells to develop
8332513 these patterns have been seen in a hit or miss way for almost 15 years
8332514 but in this study with identical twins you get a clean comparison
8332515 the brain abnormalities are there in 80 to 100 percent of the schizophrenics when you compare them to their twins
8332516 the results tell you simply that theres been some grief to this brain but not what when or where
8332517 theres a long list of potential causes from a viral infection to a trauma leading to an early loss of tissue in neural development
8332518 schizophrenia remains a very mysterious disease but were on a sharp ascending limb of discovery of its biological bases
8332519 cejis has been working with oxfam america in bolivia for several years now
8332520 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again

8332523 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8332524 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8332525 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8332526 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8332527 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8332528 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8332529 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8332530 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8332531 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8332532 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8332533 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms

8332540 the vacancy does not affect the mandate of the government nor its ability to deliver on its programmes and promises the governments mandate continues to run until the next general election is called when the incumbent team will render account to the electorate
8332541 the response of the grassroots leaders and the residents whom i had met is a great assurance none have raised the issue of a by election
8332542 refuted by nominated mp siew kum hong who said a street poll of about 300 jurong residents showed that 56 8 per cent wanted a by election
8332543 publishing industry needs that advice in an overt way its starting to make little sense why i would write something that while widely read could be given out in a cleverer format doing a book with a major corporation just starts to seem odd given the proclivities in which i do everything else now
8332544 how can a 22 year old editor bid on a book
8332545 what does a post graduate 32 000 a year fresh out know what will hit with the public
8332546 anyone who builds with maven may have a number of internal and external repositories they may be fetching things from apache or eclipse or jboss repositories nexus helps people manage all of their maven repositories from one spot inside an organization you can control your usage of maven repositories from one console a lot of times people have to manage a lot of repositories internally and externally people might have incorrect metadata or not take care of repositories like they should nexus can fix that
8332547 maven developers internally would basically be only looking at nexus
8332548 according to excerpts from the arrest reports by the anti terrorism squad involved in the case the two are suspected of aiding al qaeda insurgents involved in sectarian killings
8332549 it is worth noting that acts of violence were reported on sunday 24 august 2008 between supporters of hamas and fatah blocs at the university in which a number of students and administrative staff members were attacked
8332550 pchr is gravely concerned over this latest attack which is part of the state of security chaos prevailing in the occupied palestinian territory
8332551 if rogers isnt willing to come out and listen to the pharmacists he represents he should at least be honest about how much money hes taken from pharmaceutical and insurance companies
8332552 hes supported legislation like the prescription drug plan that favors these big companies at the expense of local drugstores
8332553 shooting straight with voters is not something that joshua segall seems to know how to do and not surprisingly voters arent buying it
8332554 the biggest thing is that we have a concerted effort k 12 to become more proficient teachers of the skills that meet the standards
8332555 i think most of the effort goes back to literally what were supposed to be doing
8332556 and thats looking at what skills the test is measuring and teaching to those skills
8332557 math has been difficult for many people for many years including most of our teachers
8332558 the teachers have taken the time and effort to become trained themselves in the areas and the skills that are necessary and then they translate it to the kids
8332559 we really do have a really dedicated staff they take their job very seriously
8332560 its just a consistent focus on looking at what student needs are and trying to monitor and adjust programs to meet student needs
8332561 weve been working through those pieces now for seven years and thats not necessarily changing at this point
8332562 i think thats always going to be an issue depending where that state standard stays
8332563 its going to be a constant struggle for us but certainly a challenge were going to take on
8332564 i dont think its anything curricular other than weve just focused our strategic learning plans on writing
8332565 mpayy provided us with the critical combination of ease of use amp implementation security and the lowest cost option for selling the tickets and collecting donations plus mpayy was able to integrate the look and feel of our site and logo
8332566 mpayy is thrilled to be working with capca and advancing the mission of the national peace corps association capca is a perfect example of the type of non profit we are looking to work with and we are set up to meet their exacting standards
8332567 it is being blocked because we found that some of the comments on the website were insensitive bordering on incitement

8332577 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8332578 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8332579 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8332580 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8332581 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8332582 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8332583 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8332584 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8332585 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8332586 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game

8332597 we are lucky to finally be able to hire a full time assistant coach changes in collegiate golf allowing two coaches to recruit off campus at the same time and having two coaches coaching during tournaments have made it essential for us to have an assistant to keep up with our competition chriss experience as a college player and currently as a professional golfer will greatly benefit our program
8332598 im looking forward to working with this young and talented team
8332599 this display and glorification of state terrorism at both home and abroad of rampant militarism of a deeply unpopular and brutal occupation resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians should be vigorously opposed and prevented from taking place
8332600 it is also hypocritical of the main nationalist parties to oppose this parade considering their eagerness to wine and dine and roll out the red carpet for their commander in chief george bush and tony blair during their recent visit
8332601 this is a futile attempt to gloss over growing discontent within the army whenever morale and recruitment is at an all time low we also call upon serving soldiers to disobey orders and refuse to be cannon fodder in the interests of imperialism careerist politicians and generals
8332602 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8332603 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8332604 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8332605 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8332606 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8332607 we received a call at the police station at 11 50 on friday

8332609 it can be from a fatal irregular heart rhythm an abnormality of the heart muscle a problem with the structure of the heart or how the heart is working or how the electrical condition of the heart is working
8332610 the thing is its usually unusual so when it does happen its tragic
8332611 in europe they do it more the doctors will give the athletes an electrocardiogram and ask for the familys history along with a physical exam
8332612 in this country the whole issue is that sports are being cut so forget health screenings they probably just listen to your heart with a stethoscope but shouldnt we be doing more

8332641 our state is going to be an enormous challenge for obama in the general election i have no illusions about that

8332720 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping

8332734 these cells are very stable and live for the life of the mouse
8332735 runtime cycle life and power are at the beginning of nearly every discussion we have with our customers
8332736 based on what we see in the survey data engineers and designers believe that with the proper cell selection and battery electronics they can create a competitive advantage for their products with a better battery pack
8332737 the design of the electronics in a battery pack that control charge and discharge with elements such as gas gauging is key to improving performance and we can see in the study that the industry is coming to appreciate that
8332738 ensuring that the charge or discharge cycles dont terminate prematurely or that the pack is not abusively charged or over discharged affects both capacity and cycle life
8332739 that cost appeared so low on the priority list for both groups we surveyed and nearly at the bottom among our marketing contacts battery performance clearly is seen as a core competitive advantage by our customers and that should be the primary consideration as we make design decisions on new battery packs for our customers
8332740 safety was seen as the second most important characteristic in selecting the right battery chemistry by engineers and designers right after runtime performance
8332741 safetys been on our customers minds more than ever lately and thats always a big question during our customer meetings they want to know if a change in battery chemistry will affect safety and they dont want to do anything to subject their designs to a potential recall
8332742 there have been many new developments in terms of technology and regulation in the industry of late and the survey responses indicate a broad divergence between those who understand their impact and those who dont
8332743 there are so many different variants of lithium ion cells for instance and not every one fits every application
8332744 some are better suited to high temperature some are ideal for supporting higher discharge rates the key element is to understand all the different cell chemistries available and to select the right one that delivers the longest runtime and overall performance while taking into account the applications other requirements such as size cost and weight
8332745 a thorough understanding of the new lithium battery shipping regulations
8332746 because of our experience in so many different battery technologies in use today rather than just a few specialties we are well positioned to assist our customers in making the right decisions in balancing performance and trade off decisions
8332747 there will be several new events this year along with the old favorites
8332748 we are planning to have live musical entertainment all day saturday on the outside stage

8332757 i dont believe that there is a stronger way to support our candidate than to support what our people want
8332758 this has become the number one issue in this campaign i think this is a very positive move one that would bring people to the party and to our candidate
8332759 the goal is to not have this serve as a lightning rod
8332760 we have a nominee for the party who is entitled to a platform he can run on and we should not create unnecessary conflicts between the nominee and the platform
8332761 we are blessed with a candidate who actually thinks and is capable of changing his position when he receives new data
8332762 we know that president mccain will eventually come around to our position but hes not there yet
8332763 to let him know how strong the sentiment is on this issue we do him a service not a disservice
8332764 this is an accountability tool and were accountable to our base and to the people who sent us here
8332765 president mccain will be in a much better position to get this accomplished than senator mccain

8332810 no one is perfect and i know people make mistakes including spousal abuse but james brown didnt learn from his mistakes he beat one wife then the next wife and so on hence my lack of respect for him now if he had changed his ways maybe or at least expressed sorrow for the hurt he caused then at least i might show a grudging respect for him even though i would probably still go and dance on his grave anyway but he didnt he was an asshole a talented one who was a sinner like all of us but he was still an asshole
8332811 now to note that james brown is self centered or egotistical or pleased with himself is hardly an insight worth troubling over that james i want to kiss myself brown dabbles in self adulation hardly makes him unique in the history of art
8332812 re enacting an elemental trauma the abandonment by his parents into a world of almost feral instability and terror

8332817 i am convinced that love is the most durable power in the world it is not an expression of impractical idealism but of practical realism far from being the pious injunction of a utopian dreamer love is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization to return hate for hate does nothing but intensify the existence of evil in the universe someone must have sense enough and religion enough to cut off the chain of hate and evil and this can only be done through love
8332818 in struggling for human dignity the oppressed people of the world must not allow themselves to become bitter or indulge in hate campaigns to retaliate with hate and bitterness would do nothing but intensify the hate in the world along the way of life someone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate this can be done only by projecting the ethics of love to the center of our lives
8332819 if i hit you and you hit me and i hit you back and you hit me back and go on you see that goes on ad infinitum it just never ends somewhere somebody must have a little sense and thats the strong person the strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate the chain of evil
8332820 la ret rica del rector general contrasta con la que utilizaba en el pasado cuando se exced a en proferir muy a mi pesar elogios dirigidos a un servidor inmerecidos por cierto ahora me denuesta con qu prop sito s lo l lo sabe
8332821 tenemos que demostrarle a los jaliscienses que estamos tomando las decisiones que nos competen he recibido miles de llamadas de estudiantes y padres de familia solidariz ndose con esta medida
8332822 estas dos decisiones forman parte de la materializaci n de la voluntad pol tica expresa del rector general para reorientar acad micamente el rumbo de la instituci n
8332823 no hay ni habr ning n poder pol tico ni liderazgo f ctico por encima de la instituci n
8332824 no me van a destituir de la udeg no hay mayor a en el cgu que pueda estar por encima de la ley
8332825 creo que ra l padilla no obstante que en su momento fue considerado un l der para impulsar los cambios en los que muchos cre mos en esta instituci n yo en lo particular confi desde 1989 ahora se ha convertido en un obst culo para la democratizaci n de la universidad de guadalajara
8332826 la visi n que ahora tengo de universidad no es la misma de abril de 2007 en 2007 y lo digo con franqueza a n reconoc a ese liderazgo y pido sic por ello disculpas a la comunidad universitaria y al pueblo de jalisco
8332827 no podemos distraer recursos del presupuesto en obras que han sido producto del capricho de ra l padilla l pez
8332828 he tomado la determinaci n de no reconocer liderazgo pol tico en particular el de ra l padilla l pez estos casi 20 a os est n llegando a su fin la universidad vuelve a los jaliscienses
8332829 ra l padilla se ha convertido en un obst culo para la democratizaci n de la universidad me he dado cuenta un poco tarde por eso pido sic disculpas
8332830 nuestro amigo el rector est haciendo una cortina de humo medi tica est exagerando sabe que es simp tico en ciertos sectores de la poblaci n satanizar m s todav a de lo que ya ha estado a ra l padilla y ahora encontr la manera de montarse en eso pero me parece hasta pat tico
8332831 pegarle a ra l es muy rentable pero el problema es con los rganos de gobierno de la universidad
8332832 qu credibilidad tendr a cualquier persona que durante 20 a os se signific por ser el m s constante el m s asiduo y el m s grande adulador de ra l padilla
8332833 me parece triste y muy lamentable que a esa edad brise o asuma esas actitudes y haga ese papel sumamente indigno
8332834 el consejo de rectores no es un rgano de gobierno sino de planeaci n y s lo puede recomendar estrategias al rector general
8332835 yo s fui electo por un consejo general universitario y en su caso con toda correcci n y respeto yo los design rector de su centro universitario
8332836 a la mejor no se requiere un centro cultural universitario o un auditorio telmex y mejor se lo vendemos a telmex todo y si es mejor un auditorito en cada centro
8332837 yo noto cierto cinismo en su forma de brise o y hay formas de tocar los temas por supuesto que todo se tiene que debatir y quiz s con m s libertad de la que permiti usted
8332838 yo no veo por qu negar la crisis negarlo no ayuda no contribuye a suavizarlo lo que m s abona es asumir un esp ritu colegiado y no de imposici n con una hora de intervenci n no ayuda

8332850 in tbilisi i left behind one small part of my heart my school friends
8332851 for the two days i was on the road i only heard snatches of reports about the war but what i ultimately saw was not at all what i had expected to see
8332852 there were russian tanks on the main highway connecting tbilisi with the countrys west we could not proceed on our way and it also transpired that the russians had blown up the railway
8332853 what kind of independence are they talking about when there are only 45 000 people living in abkhazia and 15 000 in south ossetia
8332854 russia will fall victim to its own moves as they are sure to lead to instability in russia
8332855 overall world stability has been placed in jeopardy the empire of evil has reared its head again
8332856 the diplomats have been working as normal ambassador vyacheslav kovalenko is in situ the consular division continues to issue visas to georgia citizens

8332859 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

8332873 certo nel calcio le insidie si nascondono ovunque chiaro che sarei sciocco a vedere ostacoli insormontabili dopo un 3 0 a nostro favore per va anche detto che ci tengo molto a vedere limpegno da parte di tutti non servirebbe a nulla prendere la gara alla leggera e poi rischiare di andare in difficolt e complicarsi la vita chi gioca deve dare il massimo i ragazzi lo sanno
8332874 non so valuter bene poco prima della gara di certo ci sono giocatori che vorrei vedere allopera anche per testare la condizione di tutti poi chiaramente molto dipender dalla piega che prender la gara ma ci che mi preme vedere concentrazione ed attenzione da parte di chi scender in campo dal primo minuto abbiamo la possibilit di sederci al tavolo delle big della coppa uefa e questo per noi sarebbe gi un grande traguardo

8332891 those 65 or older have long been the poor population and that really has changed for a very short window 30 or at the most 40 years

8332898 this republican trickle down idea it evaporates before it gets down to anybody else
8332899 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services

8332902 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8332903 the road from kakamega to nairobi is long and dusty a pounding ragged journey that savages the spine the first half is a shambling ditch with an archipelago of tarmac mounds that makes speed impossible and slow progress unbearable this is not surprising the first half of the road from kakamega to nairobi lies outside of central province central province if you were wondering is the land of the kikuyu the tribe of kenyas chosen ones the abused house servants of the colonial british the kikuyu managed to proffer their subservience into a primary role in independence and have been the tribe of the ruling party over the entirety of the past 45 years since uhuru independence as you might imagine the roads in central province are considerably better the man next to me on the bus from kakamega to nairobi is luya by tribe he works for a bank in nairobi but still returns monthly to see his family in kisumu near kakamega he asks me the obligatory questions posed to whitey where are you from how long have you been in kenya what do you do here why monkeys and someone pays you for this

8332910 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8332922 if we can pick four points up i think that would be very good
8332923 if they can play we will be pushing it through because it is so important for the country i think club managers will realise that for a world cup game we want to do our best to get the best possible team we can out there
8332924 every page offers pragmatic insight gained through years of effective coding experience and continues to be the principal handbook of software construction success for its practitioners project leaders should read this book cover to cover and then purchase a copy for each of their direct reports
8332925 steve mcconnells code complete is fairly unique and the first edition was justly acclaimed as a classic now with a new expanded and extensively rewritten second edition that classic status is confirmed there is so much more good solid material in the book that its difficult to do justice to it in a single review this is a book that anyone who wants to improve as a developer should read we cant recommend it enough

8332936 wilkinson established a firearms factory in a small suburb of reading that was able to meet the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8332937 these are attractive items for those connected to organised criminal networks if you have one of these readily available you will be targeted by other criminals who want to take it off you
8332938 one of the integral problems with these weapons is they do not necessarily hit your intended target they also have difficulty stopping and starting them they go off and they are difficult to keep in single fire
8332939 we can see very clearly the devastating impact of this heinous crime particularly and disproportionately although not exclusively on black communities
8332940 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london

8332961 the angry young man thing was a newspaper fabrication specifically of 1956 and 57 it was effectively all over by the time sillitoe came along so he wasnt really labelled as such a bit curiously since he or at least arthur seaton really was an angry young man of an anarchist bent

8333016 do you know what this will do to me you will ruin my life
8333017 you were convicted in my opinion on the clearest and most compelling evidence as a result of going to trial the two girls were required to give evidence
8333018 you not only required your victim to give evidence but you attempted to give an innocent explanation for what happened
8333019 you did that by besmirching the character of your victim by accusing her of behaviour inappropriate for any female but particularly for a female of her age
8333020 the jury found you guilty of three charges which are of an extremely serious nature they involved indecent assaults by you a man in your fifties on girls in their early to mid teens
8333021 he had charitable works and his position in the community that has been lost and can never be recovered
8333022 there is an extraordinary list of good deeds to put before the court he has throughout his life attempted to embrace all cultures

8333027 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral
8333028 primarily reflects melt in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8333029 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances
8333030 the arctic is gigantic when you have nine bears sighted in one transect route one can assume that there are likely a lot more bears swimming in open water

8333032 molecular evidence suggests that our common ancestor with chimpanzees lived in africa between five and seven million years ago say half a million generations ago this is not long by evolutionary standards in your left hand you hold the right hand of your mother in turn she holds the hand of her mother your grandmother your grandmother holds her mothers hand and so on how far do we have to go until we reach our common ancestor with the chimpanzees it is a surprisingly short way allowing one yard per person we arrive at the ancestor we share with chimpanzees in under 300 miles

8333040 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground in the first place with the tail area and as a consequence the tail cone the end part of the plane came off
8333041 no tyre marks were detected on the runway neither are there signs that any other part of the plane on the tarmac surface of the runway
8333042 it was a decision that was taken fundamentally for two reasons the capacity of the british commission to work with damaged black boxes and in this case the need to obtain information urgently
8333043 i guess i did realise that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8333044 and i said to myself something is going on here
8333045 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
8333046 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8333047 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8333048 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact

8333054 the entire episode seems to run counter to how we believe investigations are routinely carried out in the united states under similar circumstances
8333055 public pressure especially when applied to politicians in cases like this serves many a purpose including keeping the spotlight on aeryn gillerans disappearance when age will continue to make the case get colder and colder
8333056 this is a great opportunity for children of all ages to have fun this fall while learning healthy life skills
8333057 we encourage parents to sign their children up today due to class size limitations

8333067 sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8333068 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8333069 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8333070 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems

8333097 whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me
8333098 i thought you looked like a policeman i think so now
8333099 did i take a policemans hat by mistake out of the restaurant
8333100 have i by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere have my boots got that watchful look why must i be a policeman do do let me be a postman
8333101 but perhaps i misunderstood the delicacies of your german philosophy perhaps policeman is a relative term in an evolutionary sense sir the ape fades so gradually into the policeman that i myself can never detect the shade the monkey is only the policeman that may be perhaps a maiden lady on clapham common is only the policeman that might have been i dont mind being the policeman that might have been i dont mind being anything in german thought
8333102 did you hear me ask a plain question you pattering spy
8333103 you swear it you swear it if you swear falsely will you be damned will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave will there really be no mistake you are an anarchist you are a dynamiter above all you are not in any sense a detective you are not in the british police
8333104 but as you think policeman only a relative term of course i have nothing to do with you i am in the british police force but as you tell me you are not in the british police force i can only say that i met you in a dynamiters club i suppose i ought to arrest you
8333105 or youll get hysterical have some more beer ill join you
8333106 said the other in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt
8333107 not strict ones finish my milk great blazes yes ill finish it right enough
8333108 its rather an elaborate make up as to whether im an old man thats not for me to say i was thirty eight last birthday
8333109 i thought the president was talking about me and i rattled in my boots
8333110 i had my hand on my revolver all the time
8333111 three out of seven is a fighting number if we had only known that we were three
8333112 if we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing
8333113 you are right i am afraid of him therefore i swear by god that i will seek out this man whom i fear until i find him and strike him on the mouth if heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool i swear that i would pull him down
8333114 and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid
8333115 who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear who would debase himself to be merely brave like any common prizefighter who would stoop to be fearless like a tree fight the thing that you fear you remember the old tale of the english clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of sicily and how on his death bed the great robber said i can give you no money but i can give you advice for a lifetime your thumb on the blade and strike upwards so i say to you strike upwards if you strike at the stars
8333116 i am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in paris
8333117 that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the marquis and dr
8333118 i am amused to observe that you think i am a coward as to that i will say only one word and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric you think that it is possible to pull down the president i know that it is impossible and i am going to try it
8333119 i am going just round the corner to see whether dr bull has gone to bed he is hygienic and retires early
8333120 as a matter of fact he lives some way off on the other side of the river but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed
8333121 behind that particular window which you cant see come along and get some dinner we must call on him to morrow morning
8333122 you can find good english inns left by accident everywhere like fossils
8333123 i once found a decent place in the west end
8333124 that this is the corresponding decent place in the east end
8333125 a lot better than old gogols even at the start i thought he was a bit too hairy
8333126 gogol was an idealist he made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist but i am a realist i am a portrait painter but indeed to say that i am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression i am a portrait
8333127 i am a portrait of the celebrated professor de worms who is i believe in naples
8333128 but doesnt he know that you are taking his nose in vain
8333129 i am by profession an actor and my name is wilks
8333130 i need hardly say there was a collision the pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one professor to the other professor to see which was really the more feeble but i won an old man in poor health like my rival could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life you see he really had paralysis and working within this definite limitation he couldnt be so jolly paralytic as i was then he tried to blast my claims intellectually i countered that by a very simple dodge whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand i replied with something which i could not even understand myself i dont fancy he said that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna which are an essential of differentiation i replied quite scornfully you read all that up in pinckwerts the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by glumpe it is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as pinckwerts and glumpe but the people all round rather to my surprise seemed to remember them quite well and the professor finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples fell back upon a more popular form of wit i see he sneered you prevail like the false pig in sop and you fail i answered smiling like the hedgehog in montaigne need i say that there is no hedgehog in montaigne your claptrap comes off he said so would your beard i had no intelligent answer to this which was quite true and rather witty but i laughed heartily answered like the pantheists boots at random and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory the real professor was thrown out but not with violence though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose he is now i believe received everywhere in europe as a delightful impostor his apparent earnestness and anger you see make him all the more entertaining
8333131 i can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a nights practical joke but i dont understand your never taking it off again
8333132 when i myself left the company followed by reverent applause i went limping down the dark street hoping that i should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being

8333152 theres immediate relief after the surgery and recovery is quite quick

8333170 moved to close the divide among fellow democrats on tuesday night by offering a forceful and unequivocal endorsement of her fierce rival
8333171 deferred her own dreams on tuesday night and delivered an emphatic plea at the democratic national convention to unite behind her rival senator barack obama no matter what ill will lingers
8333172 betrayed none of the anger and disappointment that she still feels and that friends say has especially haunted her husband
8333173 rest to a bitter primary battle that left many of her supporters especially women seething months later
8333174 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8333175 did her best to put the hard feelings to rest
8333176 genuinely believes that if john mccain wins it will be bad for the country she knows that she wants barack obama to win whatever disappointment she feels whatever anger she feels about barack obama and thats real too
8333177 urged her supporters to fall in line behind the presumptive democratic nominee
8333178 and obamas are still negotiating the fine details of wednesday nights roll call vote for nominating the democratic presidential candidate
8333179 did not indicate whether she would have her name placed in nomination or seek a formal roll call of the states when the partys top prize is awarded by delegates on wednesday night
8333180 if barack obama gets the traditional post convention bounce in the polls it cant come soon enough
8333181 has led john mccain in the head to head surveys most of the summer but things at the moment appear to be changing
8333182 top elected officials continued to raise questions about obamas campaign strategy and worried aloud that he must do more to overcome the doubts voters in their states have about his readiness to be president
8333183 said that obama is still struggling to connect with working class voters and that the presumptive nominee reminded him of adlai stevenson the brainy illinoisan who lost the presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956
8333184 said obamas campaign must demonstrate its willingness to engage against a republican party that he said is well skilled in political combat
8333185 weve studied the tapes from the titans and what he did at north carolina state byu and usc
8333186 well just have to adjust to what hes doing during the game after seeing how he is attacking us
8333187 you have to look at san diego state film and junior college film you have to look at several different teams to see what you think they are doing offensively and you have to look at ucla film for personnel its a little bit different
8333188 were one of those teams that has to go to a lot of places to recruit it helps us on the west coast its a chance to play a high profile game and hopefully win

8333207 scale back protected zones for endangered whales in the atlantic ocean yielding to cargo companies concerns about new speed limits for ships in these areas
8333208 the proposal unveiled yesterday by the could end more than a year of wrangling between federal fisheries scientists and the white house over new measures to protect the north atlantic right whale about 300 of the whales remain and researchers say their tiny population has been reduced further by fatal collisions with large ships
8333209 the new plan would put in place the first speed zones off the u s coast aimed at helping right whales but environmentalists and those who study the whales said they were unhappy with the changes any reduction in protection they said could be dangerous for a species so close to the brink its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be

8333221 its outrageous that the senate republicans refused to break their filibuster against equal pay for women
8333222 women deserve a remedy when theyre denied equal pay for equal work and so do victims of discrimination based on age race national origin disability and religion as weve done on other basic bills to protect civil rights we wont take no for an answer this issue isnt going away

8333243 im going to cast my vote for senator obama if hillary clinton says shes going to cast her vote for senator obama
8333244 you could argue that no ones every ready to be president
8333245 my horse is out of the race im getting out to work for obama
8333246 i think there are a few delegates who need to vote for hillary to reach that point of closure
8333247 the story is that we are working as a team

8333249 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us

8333251 for some the noise ringing in the ear is distressing enough to seek medical help yet many suffer in silence because they dont know where to turn or how to explain it to others who do not hear this noise
8333252 remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama
8333253 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8333254 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8333255 those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8333256 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8333257 democrats know how to do this as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before
8333258 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8333259 we can drill for oil in the backyard of all of john mccains homes and never find enough oil to meet our needs
8333260 barack obama understands that the most important barrel of oil is the one you dont use
8333261 people need to understand delegates like me are strong supporters of barack obama but this is a meeting of democrats this is our family convention where we come together to represent those people who elected us
8333262 there is absolutely nothing that requires me to not support obama simply because i supported hillary clinton i worked hard for her campaign and i want the opportunity to have her on that nominating ballot because she made history
8333263 shes always been a team player when it comes to democracy and being a democrat
8333264 i think theres no question at all that she wants the party to come together and support obama to be president
8333265 i think she nailed it she knows why were democrats and that its about the people were trying to represent and not about one individual
8333266 ohio is going to come together and were going to go blue for barack obama

8333271 i believe in the core things police fire water sewer streets
8333272 going back to the effective rate would hurt a lot of the bells and whistles
8333273 it would hurt no doubt about that but we could make it
8333274 there are those who say that our day as the free worlds leader has passed that our moment is waning
8333275 they point to the anti americanism that is sometimes heard in europe and elsewhere and take this as a sign that america no longer has the strength or the moral majority to lead
8333276 the criticisms tend to pass or quiet down when global threats and dangers appear
8333277 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8333278 the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership

8333292 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8333293 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8333294 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8333295 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8333296 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8333297 these cells are very stable and live for the life of the mouse
8333298 my thinking is that we should actually try to do things with a social network that is we should consider the social network the model by which we do things
8333299 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8333300 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8333301 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8333302 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8333303 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8333304 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8333305 so much reform so little change the persistence of failure in urban schools
8333306 people dont realize how many types of algae there are from single cells to large kelp and each one develops differently
8333307 what were trying to do is choose the best of the best the ones that produce the right lipids for a particular type of fuel
8333308 its not like creating a widget its a dynamic process that will change all the time
8333309 the most optimistic assessment that ive heard is that it could be six to eight years before theres something thats useable but the tools and techniques to make it possible are being created right now
8333310 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8333311 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8333312 the land and seabed in this study area are under state ownership and will be vested in the nec for the development
8333313 with respect to obtaining the views of stakeholders the eia consultant should not be seen to be presenting information together with the developer this brings into the question the independence of the consultant this is clearly contentious and in this report records of stakeholder meetings it appears that the consultant team is protecting the developer and vice versa

8333315 this is similar to what others have found in autistic infants
8333316 we can begin to understand how the genetic mechanisms may all be working together
8333317 its painful for me to either watch or listen to myself
8333318 but even when youre not fully satisfied with the outcome thats what makes you hungry there is gratification in the fact that you a make people smile b make people dance c make people laugh or d make people make babies
8333319 acting is a totally different process than music music is a study in the romanticizing of human behavior
8333320 i have found that acting is like the un romanticizing thats not a word it is the opposite of the romantics of human behavior
8333321 we are pleased to have reached a resolution to our legal dispute with immersion that includes a 20 75 million payment to microsoft we are gratified that we have successfully resolved our claims under the 2003 settlement we negotiated with immersion which provided benefits to both companies and specific rights to microsoft
8333322 full profit recovery of the group after its difficult years in the mid 1980s
8333323 we must of course temper our enthusiasm for the future with an element of caution the world economy has still not found a new direction since the stock market crashes of october last year and we must preserve the strength of our balance sheets and maintain tight control over overheads
8333324 was the effective end of the taiping rebellion it had been conducted with appalling brutality on both sides no quarter given no prisoners taken men women and children massacred it is claimed that over 20 million perished more than all the deaths in the first world war
8333325 at ground level one can only imagine the sheer beauty of mountain ranges deserts and deltas seen high up from nasas satellites one can imagine yes however they wouldnt be quite prepared for the fact that from 400 miles away the earth transforms into abstract art the global landscape is impressionist cubist and pointillist mother nature is an abstract artist
8333326 weve secretly replaced these peoples windows vista with folgers crystals and the coffee actually works better as an operating system than the years in development software that microsoft created who knew
8333327 in order to go to the next level and create more efficient electronics such as digital cameras we need to explore ways to make things smaller
8333328 this research shows that it is possible to create smaller ultra compact infrared optical components that can be integrated into existing semiconductor technologies while not sacrificing image quality
8333329 light imaging technology is a crucial component to the field of optoelectronics which uses light instead of electrons for carrying information and represents the next generation of combined optical and electronic platforms essential for future computers
8333330 the non toxicity of the modified clay in which a layer of clay is present between each two kitosan molecules has been tested in laboratory cultures
8333331 we have removed all the barriers and in two years registered 2 000 new companies of which 700 are still working today
8333332 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8333334 boogie superstar brings to life all the fun and excitement of performing
8333335 being on stage is such a thrill and its great to be a part of an ea video game that lets girls experience how much fun it is to express themselves and explore their own creativity by performing
8333336 a new level in the convergence of games and music in boogie superstar players dont just play along they are the star of the game girls will have a blast belting their favourite tunes into the microphone and performing real dance moves that are captured on screen using the wiis motion sensing technology and the journey to stardom doesnt have to be a solo girls can also sing and dance with or against their friends in fun competitions that show off their singing and dancing talent
8333337 we have combined the very best interactive capabilities of the wii technology with the boogie brand to form an unprecedented soundtrack featuring the hottest new tracks made famous by the biggest artists in the world
8333338 weve been actively involved in natashas career since its inception and were proud to have a star like her actively involved

8333346 mr chamer i am not really here i am projecting onto your mind you may call me the examiner
8333347 you find this more comfortable again this is a projection i am reading the electro magnetic fields your brain produces then vibrating your middle ear bones to make you hear me you will understand how i can do this fairly quickly first i must explain what we that is me and the other examiners have done
8333348 youd better have a good explanation for carrying us off however you did it i assume you arent going to dissect me
8333349 please be serious a graduate student in physics figured out how to destroy a galaxy
8333350 take a negative mass and a positive mass put them next to each other they accelerate indefinitely i do not have time to explain how energy and momentum conservation hold just consider what can be done with such concentrated kinetic energy your species could produce enough to destroy a star like tau ceti where we are taking you within merely decades destroying the galaxy is simply a question of scale
8333351 i dont know anything and why fly us through space
8333352 we want humanity to know how to make negative mass
8333353 fifteen minutes before we removed you all from earth the physics graduate student had an inspiration a crude and bulky but nonetheless effective way to make negative matter
8333354 we have ways to monitor every conscious thought in a human brain by monitoring electromagnetic signals and correlating them with known stimuli i am applying such a technique to communicate with you in the other direction carefully positioned negative and positive point masses are vibrating the bones in your inner ear
8333355 they are eighteen hundred meters away and there are a lot of them
8333356 the graduate student i mentioned was not being monitored a serious oversight we only learned of his inspiration as he began to compose an email to another student at mit by the time our moving hardware many heavy positive and negative point masses could be brought to bear the mit student had read the email and told another colleague the caltech student had also started to talk we had to remove both caltech and mit rather than caltech alone
8333357 i told you we want humanity to have negative mass but only if we believe you will not misuse it
8333358 we have moved the main campuses of mit and caltech with the majority of the student body but no professors or staff
8333359 you will be deposited on the planet with your campuses plus some additional material you will be observed this time with almost as much scrutiny as we gave you and the outlying students before moving everything we will not contact you for the duration of the exercise nor will we intervene
8333360 we used a complex sequence of negative and positive point masses to prevent any pressure waves as the result of the removals
8333361 there is a way to use negative matter to support a wormhole so that information can be transferred faster than light
8333362 you must survive for decades on the planet at least as long as it takes light to travel to the earth and back
8333363 you have thirty minutes to decide before you land every other person on both campuses has the same decision if you find someone else and agree as to what you want you may pool your mass allocations chamer what do you request
8333364 there are a few minutes left before we leave you and i can convey some more information tau ceti is an old star it is twice as old as earths sun but will live some billion of your years longer you are wondering why intelligence has not arisen on the planet
8333365 the land is wiped nearly clean by glaciers roughly every ten thousand years retarding evolution
8333366 you will be landed in a cleared region on the coast of one of the equatorial landmasses your colleagues on the other campus will be deposited quite far away but still in the tropics the climate is comparable to the temperate regions of the earth you can eat many of the local species
8333367 now i must leave you chamer remember that none of you will hear us or see us during the test and remember the passing conditions you are relatively lucky in that tau ceti is less than 12 light years from earth and you can talk to the rest of your species within a quarter century we wont stop you from communicating how to make negative mass to earth you must make that decision good luck
8333368 as of a couple hours ago what can i do for you
8333369 im afraid even our final re analysis of the gaia data only pins down the positions of your objects to maybe 10
8333370 but there is an animation our techie put together please
8333371 i know its mostly pr but this map contains all the gaia data
8333372 captain lissajous of eufor research as well as dr lissajous of esa im afraid
8333373 ive seen it before they launched it through private contractors in guiana using esa hardware but what does that have to do with eufor tau ceti or me
8333374 ever wonder where they got their money and their staff heres their group of investors
8333375 that will produce a gigawatt of power when it is done equip it with maser transmitters and it could power a city or swat icbms and spysats thats why no one else in the militaries outside of those in the group know about astral and da 1 the temptation to misuse it would be too great
8333376 members of eight rival militaries are cooperating with each other to build power satellites and you cant tell your superiors i get the cooperation youd fail safe the powersats so that anyone could cut them off i see my part in this give a good public face to astral by funding basic research but tau ceti d
8333377 we dont want to build a power satellite or a weapon when the gigawatt is ready we will do this
8333378 we made this object by a targeted collision a year and a half ago we call it the pusher the gigawatt is going to do two things power the engines on the tugs to move the pusher into a nearly circular orbit at two tenths of an au from the sun and fuel the construction of more array we need a few petawatts for what we want to do meanwhile da will be building this
8333379 we call it the gamble it is going to tau ceti and im one of the recruiters for the crew
8333380 so if i accept your job offer eventually ill be given a job with astral sent up to da and stuck on board when are you planning on launching this thing why are the military types involved in something like this and why me
8333381 actually our plan is a little different astral and the space group arent satisfied just with gambling in the stars
8333382 we want to spread a small but permanent and unified human presence throughout the solar system first
8333383 as to why a partial answer to why you is that you are young in good enough health apparently willing to sacrifice a lot for this cause qualified on a professional basis and willing to accept a shadow military commission and the discipline and orders that follow from it
8333384 the rest of why you and why generals serving eight different flags have agreed to work together covertly interpreting their oaths of service creatively is the same the vanishing your sister
8333385 most of the world militaries have become quite sensibly paranoid about the vanishing
8333386 most importantly gamble needs a crew so for esa i offer you a job i also do so for eufor and for astral and for the space group you lost your sister to the vanishing this isnt vengeance or running away but it is a way to act in her memory and maybe to protect against it happening again will you accept
8333387 you deserve a little vacation by the way so far as anyone else knows unless you get permission for release this is just a research position that will eventually feed into a job with astral that is the truth up to a point
8333388 by the way what would have happened had i refused
8333389 then the group would have abandoned me that tablet would erase itself and my friends at astral would have never heard of me
8333390 modulated signal from tau ceti has ceased continued monitoring ordered to the follow up arrays the allen array and tidbinbilla are currently tracking
8333391 you said you heard what i heard the vbli got it too can we hold off until tomorrow afternoon on the release we have to inform berkeley and the chinese weve been using their arrays probably esa too i just want to hold off on the public ill say we have a potential signal and we want confirmation its true enough we should hear again by tomorrow dont ask me i went to chicago and cornell and i started ten years after they disappeared but back in 2014 they were friendly rivals im not worried about them its these examiners theyre not nice cuddly bug eyed monsters
8333392 give them an auto response i need to think no wait call janez
8333393 were not going to treat them like the us treated the buffalo theres plenty to last us twenty four years
8333394 why wont we need to eat zard after that the test may be done but were still going to be here they said theyd give us the planet not send us home so well need to plan out for more than just living from now until one magical day
8333395 they havent given us anything the easy way ill bet that if we pass there will simply be another test beyond that one maybe theyll give us phenomenal cosmic power and well be able to make food out of nothing
8333396 but i dont want to count on that so we need to domesticate the zard seed dam lake with pisces and install the hydroelectric turbine and piece together a fission reactor to use all that uranium we have piled by the isotope lab
8333397 and mina finds all the oil and we burn it and over run this world like we did earth that doesnt sound like passing
8333398 sustainable development then we have to live we just dont expand too far hydro and solar and breeder fission are clean especially since we didnt mine the uranium or make the solar cells here the examiners have to have assumed some expansion ill trust them that far although im worried about an earth species other than us running wild tau shouldnt become like australia
8333399 dont worry about that at least for the macroscopic species
8333400 im worried that tau microbes make poisons too some of them could live on pure cyanide and strychnine fortunately theyve been very susceptible to damage by acetic acid but just keeping them out of our biome is hard enough let alone the other way around
8333401 will theres been an accident the front van its rolled will are you there
8333402 im here the rest of you are safe the medics
8333403 lisa and ryan ai was in the van along with jesse kris and eli
8333404 keep talking im going to call in a couple of others
8333405 send out two more vans to meet us half way and to also bring back the evidence eli and dorman go back tomorrow with the first van ill stay here well move once the medics clear ai to travel give that two or three days
8333406 today the attorneys are going in front of judge larson and hes going to make his ruling on that because we feel its not a 100 million its 20 because they were duplicated
8333407 i think a lot of the players were worried that cibc would take another big writedown on some of the subprime issues
8333408 the fact that it was a minor writedown compared to what theyve done in the past i think is being seen quite positively
8333409 i think theres a fairly strong view out there that the fourth quarter could have a rally in commodity prices and commodity stocks
8333410 were a little bit early for that but maybe were getting started here
8333411 there are many retailers that are looking at the big national brand csd leaders as people that they can count on to drive volume and bring traffic in the store
8333412 at our largest customer our sales which have been declining for over a year at a rate greater than the overall csd category declined faster than we had anticipated in july primarily as a result of promotional activity by the national brands
8333413 you are seeing a higher level of national brand promotional activity than in the past
8333414 it certainly is clear at this point that it will have continued through the summer and into september
8333415 where adverse economic conditions have resulted in reduced print advertising
8333416 we are reviewing existing orders and inventories to address delivery commitments and maintain efficient operations during this curtailment
8333417 i dont get that horrible shit that the kids like
8333418 return 400 acres and we will leave singur but we will not bow our heads to the cpm and the tatas and for that i am ready to sacrifice my life
8333419 i am still holding my patience it is not a movement by any political party but a farmers movement we have already agreed that the main factory of the plant will be set up on 600 acres how much more blood of farmers do they want
8333420 the government is now holding brief for the truck operators after looking after the interests of the tatas
8333421 one road has been closed next it is turn of chief minister buddhadeb bhattacherjees doors to the writers buildings state secretariat to be closed
8333422 the step was taken considering the peoples inconvenience in mind
8333423 we were able to move to a safer place we dont know what is happening inside

8333442 the lidar system developed by epfl is a relative of the familiar radar systems used widely in weather forecasting instead of sending radio waves out looking for water droplets however the lidar sends a beam of light vertically into the sky the echo here is a reflection of that light from different layers in the atmosphere this reflection is used to build an instantaneous vertical profile of temperature and humidity the spatial and temporal resolution is excellent the laser beam can be shot 30 times per second a vast improvement over weather balloons that take minutes to reach the upper atmosphere and can be sent out only a few times a day and even though its state of the art technology the lidar developed by epfl is stable and reliable even after a test run of several months it did not need tuning traditional lidar systems are more finicky typically needing to be tuned on a daily basis
8333443 the system will be installed in a cabin divided into two distinct rooms a
8333444 can also detect fine particles including pollen and from 2010 will be able to build up 3d temperature profiles

8333453 rajewsky and i had published a paper on the conductivity of erythrocytes reporting for the first time dielectric measurements on biological materials extending up to 1 000 mhz i mention all of these things to indicate the decisive role that the navy and nih played navy support has been available to me in one form or another ever since 1947 and nih support since 1952
8333454 while a young physics student financial problems forced me to interrupt my studies until i found employment as an electronics technician at the oswalt institute for physics in medicine now the max planck institute for biophysics cell membranes are not likely to be affected directly by microwaves since fields of interest can only apply potentials across the membranes that are vanishingly small in comparison with potentials needed to yield significant membrane responses and significant responses of biopolymers require field strength levels very much higher than those causing undue heating
8333455 i am not aware of military antipersonnel weapons using em
8333456 disastrously low there is reason to believe that this situation has arisen in part through a well organized activity on the part of major corporate entities from the consumer and military electronic industries to discredit all research into athermal biological and biomedical effects
8333457 it is now well established that intrinsic electromagnetic fields play a key role in a broad range of tissue functions including information transmission in the nervous system

8333460 by this time i had been approached on a number of occasions by the central intelligence agency the contacts were innocuous to begin with at first the cia people wanted to know about research i had performed on the ophthalmological effects of microwave and laser radiation they also wanted me to analyze some of the foreign and american literature on the subject of radiation for them in 1964 however they started asking me about the possible behavioral effects of microwaves they wanted to know for example whether i thought that electromagnetic radiation beamed at the brain from a distance could affect the way a person might act i said that from what i had read primarily in soviet literature on the subject it seemed conceivable during 1964 and 1965 i had a number of visits from a medical doctor who worked for the agency he wanted to know if a device that took pictures at night with an invisible laser beam instead of a conventional flashbulb was safe to use when i exposed the eye of a rabbit to the beam i found that it produced an immediate retinal hemorrhage so i told him that in my opinion the device was not safe he also wanted answers to a number of theoretical questions for instance would a laser beam directed at a listening device planted on a windowsill be liable to injure anyone inside the room that was being bugged and could microwaves be used to facilitate brainwashing or to break down prisoners under interrogation
8333461 the potential for hazards from niemr has long been known to the industries involved
8333462 some industries have been funding research designed to show the absence of harm to workers or the general public
8333463 directed energy weapons research work in this field has been carried out in almost all industrialized countries and especially by the great powers with a view to using these phenomena for anti materiel or anti personnel purposes it is possible today to generate a very powerful microwave pulse e g between 150 and 3 000 megahertz with an energy level of several hundreds of megawatts using specially adapted antenna systems these generators could in principle transmit over hundreds of metres sufficient energy to cook a meal however it is important to mention that the lethal of incapacitating effects which can be expected from weapons systems using this technology can be produced with much lower energy levels using the principle of magnetic field concentration which permits the control of the geometry on the target by means of antenna systems especially designed for the purpose the radiated energy can be concentrated on very small surfaces of the human body for example the base of the brain where relatively low energy can produce lethal effects in spite of the rarity of publications on this subject and the fact that it is usually strictly classified information research undertaken in this field seems to have demonstrated that very small amounts of electromagnetic radiation could appreciably alter the functions of living cells research work has also revealed that pathological effects close to those induced by highly toxic substances could be produced by electromagnetic radiation even at very low power especially those using a pulse shape containing a large number of different frequencies some research seem to have confirmed that lo level electromagnetic fields modulated to be similar to normal brainwaves could seriously affect brain function experiments with pulsed magnetic fields carried out in animals have reportedly produced specific effects such as inducing sleep and triggering anxiety or aggressiveness depending on the modulation of the frequency used it is on the other hand well known that lethal effects can also be produced by using higher power levels than those used for the experiments on behaviour modification an anti personnel weapon based on such biophysical principles could produce similar effects to those of a nerve gas but would have no secondary effects and leave no lasting trace
8333464 in fact the military routinely has approached the national institutes of health
8333465 darpa defense advanced research projects agency has come to use every few years to see if there are ways to incapacitate the central nervous system remotely

8333468 using a meg a technology llinas helped develop he has been studying the brains electromagnetic waves what he has found in broad paraphrase is that the thalamus is in constant dialogue with the brains higher processing centers an electromagnetic loop sends pulses from the thalamus to the cortex but the different sensory centers of the brain also message the thalamus in return consciousness exists when these oscillations are in sync pulsing at the same rate so smells sounds and so forth assemble in a kind of electromagnetic symphony
8333469 after the organization of the central nervous system has been explored and understood the way will be open to develop and use the technology of electromagnetic brain signals
8333470 we were all bright young men together we were all precocious 30 years ago
8333471 nothing important in science stays secret for long the russians had hundreds of secret projects luckily we are not so good as the russians at hiding stupid stuff so stop worrying about imaginary scares one of my friends cures his patients with magnets but this had nothing to do with science
8333472 i have felt it myself the glitter of nuclear weapons it is irresistible if you come to them as a scientist to feel its there in your hands to release this energy that fuels the stars to let it do your bidding to perform these miracles to lift a million tons of rock into the sky it is something that gives people an illusion of illimitable power and it is in some ways responsible for all our troubles this what you might call technical arrogance that overcomes people when they see what they can do with their minds
8333473 this book grew out of a set of lectures given in may 1995 at the hebrew university of jerusalem the idea of radiotelepathy first appeared so far as i know in the science fiction novel last and first men written by olaf stapledon in 1931 in which the cells of a multicellular creature communicate with each other by means of electric and magnetic fields the chief barrier to progress in neurophysiology is the lack of observational tools to understand in depth what is going on in the brain we need tools that can fit inside or between the neurons and transmit reports of neural events to receivers outside observing instruments with rapid response high band width and high spacial resolution there is no law of physics that declares that such an observational tool to be impossible we know that high frequency electromagnetic signals can be propagated through brain tissue for distances of the order of centimeters we know that microscopic generators and receivers of electromagnetic radiation are possible we know that modern digital data handling technology is capable of recording and analyzing the signals emerging from millions of tiny transmitters simultaneously all that is lacking in order to transform these possibilities into an effective observational tool is the neurological equivalent of integrated circuit technology we need a technology that allows us to build and deploy large arrays of small transmitters inside a living brain just as integrated circuit technology allows us to build large arrays of small transistors on a chip of silicon radioneurology is in principle only an extension of the existing technology of magnetic resonance imaging which also used radio frequency magnetic fields to observe neural structures a rough estimate based on the available band width indicates that a million transmitters could be monitored through each patch of brain surface with size equal to the radio wave length the factor of a million is the ratio between the radio band width of the order of hundreds of millions of cycles per second and the band width of a neuron of the order of hundred of cycles
8333474 soviet mind altering techniques designed to impact on an opponent are well advanced the procedures employed include manipulation of human behavior through the use of psychological weapons effecting sight sound smell temperature electromagnetic energy or sensory deprivation
8333475 soviet researchers studying controlled behavior have also examined the effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans and have applied these techniques against the u s embassy in moscow
8333476 researchers suggest that certain lowfrequency elf emissions possess psychoactive characteristics these transmissions can be used to induce depression or irritability in a target population the application of large scale elf behavior modification could have horrendous impact
8333477 louis slesin editor of the trade journal microwave news stated
8333478 more than any other issue people just do not want to talk about this
8333479 the concept of non lethal weapons is not new the term appears in heavily censored cia documents dating from the 1960s
8333480 we have persuaded reporters to postpone change hold or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interests or jeopardized sources and methods
8333481 the government secrecy system as a whole is among the most poisonous legacies of the cold war the cold war secrecy system also mandates active deception
8333482 a security manual for special access programs authorizes contractors to
8333483 the use of cover to conceal the existence of a government facility or the fact of government research and development interest in a particular technology is broader than necessary and significantly increases costs
8333484 can we influence human emotions and behavior are there or were such experiments now going on
8333485 this is not a subject were going to discuss with you or anyone else
8333486 this book is about a new type of war electronic war it is fought by research students in universities and electronics engineers working for defense contractors it is a war that must be waged constantly during peacetime to maintain the upper hand it is a war that must be waged in secrecy
8333487 the companies and establishments where they worked are reluctant to give out details of any projects even those already in the public domain in addition there are many other project so called black projects which these organizations cannot even officially admit to the secrecy surrounding the peacetime preparations for a future electronic war ensures that any attempt to prove or disprove a definite work link can be not more than a calculated stab in the dark in may 1989 for example eleven russians and four czechs were expelled from the uk for allegedly trying to obtain highly sensitive information about powerful microchips radar laser technology and advanced materials such as titanium and carbon fibres these agents were reported to have approached the executive of defense contractors in a series of cash for secrets deals another theory concerns the investigation into alleged fraud at marconi this investigation by the ministry of defense police has since resulted in charges being brought however there is not one scrap of evidence to suggest that any of the scientists named in the book were involved in fraud the deaths and disappearances of 28 defense workers is one of the most bizarre and enigmatic stories of the past decade
8333488 looking at the moscow signal the zapping of an embassy 35 years later the mystery lingers
8333489 in our experiments we did some remarkable things and there was no question in my mind that you can get into the brain with microwaves if you really make the breakthrough youve got something better than any bomb ever built because when you finally come down the line youre talking about controlling peoples minds
8333490 dod intel agencies look at russian mind control technology claims fbi considered testing on koresh
8333491 psycho correction detection decoding and countermeasures programs should be undertaken by the u s
8333492 some of the research sounds even less rational there are according to lewer plans for pulsed microwave beams to destroy enemy electronics and separate plans for very low frequency sound beams to induce vomiting bowel spasm epileptic seizures and also crumble masonry
8333493 there are plans for mind control with the use of psycho correction messages transmitted by subliminal audio and visual stimuli there is also a plan for psychotronic weapons apparently the projection of consciousness to other locations and another to use holographic projection to disseminate propaganda and misinformation
8333494 mc ultra program use of mind control equipment by armed forces not ruled out by moscow based foreign policy institute
8333495 since the years of soviet rule people have spoken furtively in russia of
8333496 the health ministry and the fsb are doing medical experiments on over a million innocent people
8333497 they put chemicals in the water and use magnets to alter your mind we are fighting to prove to the authorities that we are not mad
8333498 we have no evidence that our local mafia has psychotronic weapons they have enough ordinary ones
8333499 they are not the most technologically advanced mafia in the world it must be cheaper just to use guns
8333500 the equipment that now exists in laboratories must be very strictly controlled to prevent it from being sold to the private sector
8333501 one could call this black science research scientists whose funding has been cut have resorted to putting equipment costing millions of rubles to any use that will pay
8333502 of course this project is surrounded with a lot of hysteria and conjecture
8333503 something that was secret for so many years is the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories
8333504 weapons based on new physical principles would include amongst others means in which physical principles which have not been used hitherto are used to strike at personnel military equipment and objectives amongst weapons of this kind one might include beam radio wave infrasonic geophysical and genetic weapons in their strike characteristics these types of weapons might be no less dangerous than mass strike weapons the soviet union considers it necessary to establish a ban on the development of arms of this kind
8333505 known as acoustic psycho correction the capability to control minds and alter behavior of civilians and soldiers may soon be shared with u s military medical and political officials according to u s and russian sources therefore the russian authors have proposed a bilateral center for psycho technologies where u s and russian authorities could monitor and restrict the emerging capabilities
8333506 will the soldiers who have survived battlefields of the future return home with psychosis epilepsy and blindness inflicted by weapons designed to do exactly that
8333507 many of the non lethal weapons under consideration utilize infrasound or electromagnetic energy including lasers microwave or radio frequency radiation or visible light pulsed at brainwave frequency for their effects these weapons are said to cause temporary or permanent blinding interference with mental processes modification of behavior and emotional response seizures severe pain dizziness nausea and diarrhea or disruption of internal organ functions in various other ways
8333508 research work in this field electromagnetic weapons has been carried out in almost all industrialized countries and especially by the great powers with a view to using these phenomena for anti materiel or anti personnel purposes
8333509 a harvard molecular geneticist and biological chemical warfare specialist matthew s meselson warned were going to learn how to manipulate every life process genetic ones mental ones the emotional ones if our inevitably increasing knowledge of life process is also harnessed to hostile purposes that will completely change the nature of the expression of human hostility
8333510 calls for international convention introducing a global ban on all developments and deployments of weapons which might enable any form of manipulation of human beings
8333511 for decades those who claimed to be victims of clandestine radiation experiments conducted by the united states government were dismissed as paranoid
8333512 he paul schaefer engineer cites numerous examples of occasions when
8333513 a neighbor called me over to her porch one day to tell me shed seen a beam of light come out of the sky and shoot into one of my windows
8333514 i could see the path through the garden where the leaves turned yellow when asked why they want to attack him he said it was because of his radical activities and writings
8333515 it totally scrambled my brain leaving me unable to think properly simply functioning on sheer shock and horror with total incomprehension of what was going on it actually was debilitating the room felt like a torture chamber this forced me out of my home i believe that the technology used be it some type of a frequency assault some sort of directed energy in addition to whatever was injected in me has caused damage to my brain i have been living with this debilitating and excruciating pain for the last eight months so far
8333516 his aluminum foil hat has tiny holes in it says rex niles proof that the government
8333517 so i would go to the window or one time i was dressed because i couldnt sleep so i went down and the street was absolutely empty
8333518 this has been a very tough story to tell people
8333519 mind reading machine tells secrets of the brain sci fi comes true
8333520 technology that can be used to manipulate peoples thought processes their mood their memories and possibly even their will if it is developed sufficiently
8333521 the government has never disproved the psychological effects of electromagnetic radiation
8333522 a decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create the perception of noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power pulsed microwave when people are illuminated with properly modulated low power microwaves the sensation is reported as a buzzing clicking or hissing which seems to originate regardless of the persons position in the field within or just behind the head the phenomena occurs at average power densities as low as microwatts per square centimeter with carrier frequencies from 0 4 to 3 0 ghz by proper choice of pulse characteristics intelligible speech may be created before this technique may be extended and used for military applications an understanding of the basic principles must be developed such an understanding is not only required to optimize the use of the concept for camouflage decoy and deception operations but is required to properly assess safety factors of such microwave exposure
8333523 sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intracranially within the head can be induced by signal modulation at very low average power densities
8333524 has great potential for development into a system for disorienting or disrupting the behavior patterns of military or diplomatic personnel
8333525 to control the will and perception of adversaries by applying a regime of shock and awe it is about effecting behavior

8333533 in the prevailing situation we will place the security of our nation first and fight against terror at higher pedestal than our rally of the day
8333534 i know he gave up the vice captaincy a little while ago because there were a few issues there and there probably still are a few issues
8333535 but if its as a stand in and an emergency i dont think he will say no to helping the team out
8333536 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8333537 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again
8333538 it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that
8333539 theres no reason why we cant change momentum its going to take a massive effort from the senior players but its an opportunity for us to stand up and be counted
8333540 we have talked about trying to forget what happened at trent bridge but you cant
8333541 one or two of the senior guys are really going to have to respond now if we are going to have any chance at all in the series
8333542 its not as if we were not there it was different from the first game when all the batsmen got in and then gave it away and got out at bad times
8333543 but that is the way we decided to go with selection we are playing wicket taking bowlers
8333544 we were criticised in the past for not having wicket takers so we have gone with this kind of selection
8333545 so it is about knuckling down and one of the top four has to bat through and get a hundred every time
8333546 we dont want to pack the team with nine batsmen and send the message to the top order that there are other people that can do the job

8333564 the furthest out weve heard from people has been canada
8333565 even if it has to go to the supreme court
8333566 they havent killed the dog yet they dont want to back down but theyre feeling the heat
8333567 this is a pretty extreme use of government power to be able to knock on someones door take their dog away and kill it just because of its breed
8333568 but in my mind its 50 50 whatever i have to do to save my son
8333569 im too scared to have forrest anywhere in this state
8333570 its an opportunity for us to showcase our state and tourism and our mountain resorts to a worldwide audience
8333571 we dont have any operations in minneapolis and therefore we didnt make a contribution there
8333572 it was an opportunity to talk to media from all over the world about our resorts and expose more potential guests to our mountain resorts
8333573 i saw it on tv and couldnt wait to try it
8333574 these guys are very accessible thats part of their appeal
8333575 we wanted to the food to be tied with cincinnati and southwest ohio so skyline chili made a lot of sense
8333576 were going to go through something like 200 pounds of chili spaghetti easily
8333577 it will be a really neat experience for our guests
8333578 the experience is treated like a heavyweight title match with emcees and music
8333579 im going to try and ride a roller coaster after the contest
8333580 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone

8333582 china has been raising accusing fingers on the dalai lama without any evidence to substantiate it there is no no truth in the latest charge too
8333583 there is nothing new in it time and again beijing has been levelling baseless allegations against him
8333584 the entire world knows that dalai lama stands for peace and had always worked for amicable solution to the vexed tibetan problem
8333585 the tibetan side is in touch with the chinese authorities to finalise a suitable date in october for next round of talks to move further towards finding a peaceful solution to the tibetan problem
8333586 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8333587 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8333588 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8333589 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else then thats where we need to be
8333590 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking
8333591 we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian

8333600 she didnt get paid for this to help children and families get out of poverty
8333601 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8333602 from the shore to the sideshow a tour of the history and future of coney island
8333603 i am overwhelmed by the love and affection that people have showered on us
8333604 this will definitely prompt us to go for gold in the london 2012 olympics i have not been able to sleep for the last two nights because of the love i have got after arriving in india
8333605 we could never imagine such a welcome it is amazing all this will give a big boost to non cricket sports in this country

8333617 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8333618 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8333619 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8333620 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8333621 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8333622 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8333623 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8333624 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8333625 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8333626 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8333627 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8333628 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8333629 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8333630 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8333631 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8333632 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8333633 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8333634 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8333635 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8333636 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8333637 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8333638 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8333639 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8333640 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8333641 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8333642 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8333643 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8333644 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8333645 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8333646 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8333647 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8333648 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8333649 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8333650 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8333651 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8333652 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8333653 get the real story not the story the politicians want you to say
8333654 is that a wireless mike are you registered to use that
8333655 because i support a democratic party united behind barack obama
8333656 oh no those kind of questions arent for me i pass
8333657 its alright to let us in neither mo nor i have any jowls
8333658 im not sure if thats me who smells bad or if that was someone walking by
8333659 well we are at the gym so i assume everyone smells bad
8333660 im not sure if thats me who smells bad or if that was someone walking by

8333697 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests

8333733 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8333734 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8333735 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8333736 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8333737 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation

8333745 this program is presented by wqed pittsburgh and wgbh boston
8333746 do you know what this will do to me you will ruin my life
8333747 you were convicted in my opinion on the clearest and most compelling evidence as a result of going to trial the two girls were required to give evidence
8333748 you not only required your victim to give evidence but you attempted to give an innocent explanation for what happened
8333749 you did that by besmirching the character of your victim by accusing her of behaviour inappropriate for any female but particularly for a female of her age
8333750 the jury found you guilty of three charges which are of an extremely serious nature they involved indecent assaults by you a man in your fifties on girls in their early to mid teens
8333751 he had charitable works and his position in the community that has been lost and can never be recovered
8333752 there is an extraordinary list of good deeds to put before the court he has throughout his life attempted to embrace all cultures
8333753 she knew what she needed to do and she delivered
8333754 if i can support him for these reasons you should too
8333755 e un gioco spieg la follia io mi copro gli occhi e incomincio a contare fino ad un milione voi nel frattempo vi nascondete e quando non c pi nessuno in giro ed io ho finito di contare il primo di voi che trovo si mette a contare al posto mio
8333756 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8333757 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8333758 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8333759 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8333760 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8333761 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8333762 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8333763 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8333764 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8333765 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8333766 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8333767 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8333768 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8333769 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8333770 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8333771 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8333772 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8333773 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8333774 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8333775 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8333776 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8333777 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8333778 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8333779 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8333780 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8333781 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8333782 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8333783 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8333784 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8333785 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8333786 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8333787 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8333788 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8333789 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8333790 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8333791 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8333792 i love how iris has to unnaturally narrate everything for jim its not like he cant see lizs dress and anthonys tux where does he think they were a costume party and just like i said yesterday no april its not like shed actually want to see her grandfather when shes usually the only patterson who actually acts like she cares about him no today its all about liz
8333793 no normal person would go out of her way to stress just how freshly married lizthony were before hightailing it to the hospital for this visit the only reason for her doing so is to set up the dreadful pun another reason working backward from an idiotic pun is a bad idea
8333794 oh and now hes perfectly fine and making thought bubble puns
8333795 i get it its a pun on the name of a horrible crime just like the wedding was
8333796 and now what grandpa can die in peace knowing that his beloved granddaughter has married this asshole and where are his wonderful son and daughter still at the party eating dancing as he withers away
8333797 and so grandpa jim ends not with a whimper but with a pun and a smirk
8333798 strange that being hated by millions should be part of lynns legacy id hoped for better from her
8333799 i feel about the foob finale the same way i did when bush first got elected
8333800 it finally hit me today reading the washington post article about the relaunch that if lj pulls this off she will be 90 when it wraps again and ill be in my 60s
8333801 in october it will be a ratio of 50 50 the color sunday comics will be all new material i think it will be 50 50 for the first year at least
8333802 johnston sounds as upbeat as ever about producing the strip she says she doesnt even use it to take veiled digs at her ex husband well except once
8333803 the only thing ive put in the strip with a sarcastic streak toward my ex husband is john pattersons potbelly because my ex is very proud of his physique
8333804 perhaps i made up my own husband and saw john patterson in my husband
8333805 i was quitting to make my husband happy and he still wasnt happy
8333806 the end of the world is here lizardbreath has married blandthony grandpa jim is on his deathbed with pitiable second wife iris at his side our protagonist elly patterson is a
8333807 grandma marion is learning the sad truth about the comics afterlife
8333808 despite the fact that you no doubt remember yourself as the ravishing young bride who actually wore the dress that youre ectoplasmically helping to mend you instead only get to come back as aged and potato nosed youre also wearing an apron because even in the great beyond youre expected to cook
8333809 or maybe shell just be forgotten like richie cunninghams big brother on happy days
8333810 hmm could that be considered a pattern the girls are adored when theyre cute personality devoid toddlers but once they develop wants and needs independent of their parents theyre spoiled and selfish someone needs to send a memo to lynn children arent toys to be put away when youre bored with them
8333811 by the time that a nine year old liz would have started whining that their old baby wasnt ready for the new one this exercise in revisionist history would have long since come to an end this means of course wed be stuck with whatever ending lynn gives us this sunday but it would be better than retconning her out of existence
8333812 im standing by my prediction that sometime early next year lynn will reverse herself again and announce that shes going to run the strip in
8333813 sadly i went and read the other article and when i saw the lj quote

8333850 when i became governor this is what virginia faced a massive budget shortfall an economy that wasnt moving gridlock in the capital sound familiar so what did we do working together a democratic governor with a two to one republican legislature and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians we closed the budget gap and virginia was named the best managed state in the nation we made record investments in education and in job training we got 98 of eligible kids enrolled in our childrens health care program

8333854 my fellow americans as dark as things may look today we can indeed make the dreams of our future better than the history of the past seven years but it can only be done if we stop dreaming of how good things used to be stop fighting amongst ourselves over woulda coulda shoulda and start doing the things we need to be doing together to make a better future a reality americans have made more unrealistic dreams a reality for more people than any nation on earth and we can uniquely do it in this new century as well

8333962 what are the real things osha has something to do with

8333977 big time sporting events provide a unique platform to educate fans on green initiatives and we feel that the best way we can educate is to lead by example
8333978 we have a plan that will lessen the environmental impact of the event and heighten the environmental awareness of those who attend it
8333979 we are taking a big step with the home of the us open becoming one of the first in the tennis community to take significant action to positively impact the environment
8333980 the us open will serve as a springboard for other tennis events to declare their commitment and actions to a greener approach to our sport
8333981 the usta is using its market influence and cultural visibility to send environmentally meaningful signals to the market place
8333982 all tennis fans should take pride in what the usta is doing by using clean non fossil fuel energy to power this event switching to recycled paper products promoting the use of public transportation and assuring the recycling of its plastic debris the usta is making an important statement that we all need to lighten our impact on the planet this smart event planning should be used as the model for all tennis events worldwide

8333996 il faut prendre en compte cette psychologie la fois de revanche et en m me temps dencerclement de la russie
8333997 nest pas un partenaire secondaire cest un partenaire plein et il faut donc de ce point de vue souvrir un v ritable dialogue renouvel avec la russie
8333998 il faut se battre sur un principe fort qui est celui de lint grit territoriale m me si le kosovo fragilise un peu cette position
8333999 il y a une sp cificit du kosovo qui peut tre d fendue
8334000 le conseil de latlantique nord condamne la d cision de la f d ration de russie de reconna tre les r gions g orgiennes doss tie du sud et dabkhazie et appelle la russie revenir sur sa d cision

8334002 ne peut accepter ces violations de tout le droit international
8334003 la russie change de mani re arbitraire et avec violence les fronti res de leurope si leurope se laisse faire une fois la russie recommencera lavenir

8334014 once upon a time it was the americans who were terrorists against the british
8334015 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8334016 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8334017 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8334018 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8334019 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8334020 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8334021 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8334022 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8334023 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance

8334025 als het echt warm is gaan mensen eerder naar zee dan naar een pretpark is het grijs en bewolkt maar droog dan krijgen we vaak heel wat bezoekers over de vloer
8334026 voor de maanden juli en augustus 2008 zullen we rekening houdend met de weersvoorspellingen voor de komende dagen uitkomen op 316 000 bezoekers dit is een stijging van 7 procent vergeleken met 2007 de week van 14 juli en van 18 augustus waren de minst goede toen kampten we met hevig regenweer
8334027 juli was beter dan vorig jaar en augustus was stabiel het waterpark aqualibi doet het alsmaar beter en profiteerde van het wisselvallige weer
8334028 ziet het er naar uit dat het een goed seizoen is geweest en nog zal zijn
8334029 we hebben het zeker niet slechter gedaan dan vorig jaar en verwachten voor de komende weken nog heel wat bezoekers

8334033 our goal is to democratize democracy myspace is the leading forum for engaging in discussions of ideas and culture so its important that we have a strong presence at both conventions
8334034 this is where leaders of government business and citizens all come together and our unique platform provides an ideal setting for all of these groups to connect
8334035 this ignores the realities of policing where an emergency could require all sworn staff to report to frontline duty at a moments notice
8334036 but we would not expect the public to be any less protected
8334037 it felt like i was inside a deep fryer like an overcooked chip it knocked me down and i was still convulsing after the first hit

8334058 the educational side of the new park will give people ways to take care of their waterways into the future
8334059 people dont realise that things like washing cars with detergents and using fertilisers near drains can contribute to degrading our waterways because the chemicals can end up in the water system
8334060 the phosphate they produce in their waste is a contributor to the algal blooms that degrade the lakes
8334061 we are trying to educate the public into not feeding them bread which is actually bad for the birds and for the lakes and to feed them away from the water
8334062 the park will be an example of best environmental practice not just for the public but for developers also
8334063 if we are asked to make an offer we will do so
8334064 we are all very happy and cazorla is going to be an extremely important player for villarreal over the next six years calm is returning to the squad which was shaken in recent hours

8334066 it is my home and the club that has made me feel important they have made an effort for me to stay and i greatly value that
8334067 when people have money invested and theres 20 000 new zealanders investing in the company you expect something a little bit better than that from the chairman
8334068 its very unsatisfactory but thats been him all along hes a doer not a communicator
8334069 there is also a deferred tax adjustment 58 million which is purely ifrs international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result
8334070 i dont think we can overestimate his impact on new zealand business
8334071 im so excited to finally be able to bring my show to new zealand this will be my second visit but my first concert performance and i cant wait to see you all there

8334075 before the data the energy markets were already up because of the storm and so the eia numbers have not made much of an impact although crude inventories being down was a bit of a surprise
8334076 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8334077 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8334078 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector
8334079 what i expect from opec is to keep pumping at the same level after the increase
8334080 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another

8334092 obviously we want to ensure a strong future for the viper but as we focus on the core business well listen to people who have expressed interest
8334093 the market has changed significantly competition within that premium luxury category only intensifies and as a result it really puts something like the viper at a competitive disadvantage from the standpoint that its obviously a very niche focus with limited scale
8334094 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter

8334103 he had as full a part in training on our recent trip to france as was appropriate at this time in his recovery
8334104 certainly part of our strategy was that we could not afford to have four guys in a back line that were going to be missing for 11 games
8334105 the four players that have to replace them are not going to be of equivalent quality because it is going to be difficult to carry four international backs to cover them when they are away

8334127 these three trials do not provide any credible evidence of any side effect
8334128 it should push people further away from the use of the drug

8334149 im a big nun man there are some weekends when its just me a bottle of pinot grigio a big bag of kettle chips and my directors cut of the sound of music and no clothes obviously
8334150 nuns are not objects for your rampant carnal lusts they are the brides of christ and only he is allowed to slip his hand under their heavy garments or ask them to dress up as a cheeky milkmaid

8334164 krebs ist keine krankheit der reichen l nder wie man immer denkt
8334165 our decision to convert a sizeable portion of our note will not only reduce debt improve cash flow and enhance the balance sheet of the company but it should also serve as a demonstration of the complete confidence we have in our business model and ability to move from a period of slow backlog turnover to profitable quarters along with significant pay cuts taken by gallagher and myself the pay reduction of board members and additional overhead reduction measures these actions will assist the company in recovering its ebitda losses experienced in the past six quarters my sole interest is to bring our company to cash flow positive and in the process increase shareholder value to our investors
8334166 we are securing business with outstanding customers who trust us with the engineering and development of their critical assets and resources our technology consulting business is very strong and for those who understand our business model tc is the precursor to projects with large positive cash flow because of this i am joining with tom to make similar concessions regarding salary as well as converting 1 million of my seller note to stock i am also restructuring the balance of my seller note to delay principal payments and interest payments until march 2010

8334168 i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
8334169 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8334170 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8334171 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8334172 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8334173 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8334174 in 1992 watching tv the liberation day parade the commentator was going down the street asking all these people what they thought of liberation day 15 20 people everything was about party family reunions barbeque over night no school not one person said anything about why we celebrate liberation day and i really thought that was a sad travesty
8334175 the financial state of the government of guam is bleak
8334176 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure were its heading
8334177 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8334178 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8334179 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8334180 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8334181 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8334182 while down in the first half of 2008 we expect the carrier voip equipment market to bounce back in the second half ending the year on a positive note the five year outlook looks good as well as demand for voip networking gear continues unabated driven by a long term migration from circuit switched to packet telephony
8334183 similarly while the session border controller segment saw its first sequential decline this quarter due to a pause in deployments in north america and europe where large service providers are maxing out their installed base rather than purchasing new equipment we expect it to pick up nicely in the second half of the year
8334184 it hasnt been that both have done bad or both have done great
8334185 its just that both have been very consistent the players rally around both of them
8334186 its a great situation for us both will be hungry to play and i want it that way i want them both to be very competitive but i also want both of them to know theyre on the same team
8334187 i guess well find out when everybody else finds out
8334188 yall know just as much as i know so well see
8334189 i know that im going to be out there and i know ill be playing so im not worried about it i think were both going to play
8334190 the thing about kodi is hes still in the learning mode
8334191 chris has been in this offense since diapers hes been running it forever without a big separation i think its great on kodis part to be able to catch up and learn chris has been a big part of that chris has been helping him out
8334192 we cant let this divide the team at all between me and chris weve got to stay strong as quarterbacks and not let our individual things get in the way of our team goals
8334193 were worried about what were going to do on saturday well let the offense handle their business
8334194 i dont like talking about it but theres going to be things that i plan to do that ive never done on a college level
8334195 yall will see its going to be a whole other season
8334196 glen coffee is mr consistency for us in terms of being able to do just about everything whether its being a good receiver being a good blocker and being decent when he has the ball in his hands
8334197 mark ingram has probably been the surprise of all the young players in terms of his maturity as a player
8334198 hes elusive he has speed but he has power and tremendous toughness and hes a good receiver hes a very very good all around guy
8334199 we dont have a third down back in that bunch
8334200 we feel like several of those guys can play that role and we certainly need to figure out ways to use that group
8334201 third and 2 is just as important as a 50 yard gain when it comes down to it
8334202 but i will be tuning in after the game and i will find out what they rushed for so i cant lie about that
8334203 you know our stance around here youve got to be ready to play if hes ready to play hell play
8334204 a heretic came to rabbi akiva and asked who created the world
8334205 this outbreak is really taxing us and we think a provincial consensus is needed to determine whether we should just resign ourselves to large numbers of cases or determine what to do to mitigate the spread through some sort of immunization campaign
8334206 after all this is not a trivial disease weve had many cases resulting in hospitalizations and complications like deafness meningitis and testicular involvement which can cause sterility
8334207 theres no guarantee it wont spread to the vancouver region
8334208 at the moment there is some evidence that it is moving out of the faith based communities and into the broader communities

8334212 prevention of crs is the main objective of rubella vaccination programs in the united states a rubella epidemic in the united states in 1964 1965 resulted in 12 5 million cases of rubella infection and about 20 000 newborns with crs

8334226 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him up to seven times
8334227 i do not say to you up to seven times but up to seventy times seven
8334228 for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves
8334229 when he had begun to settle them one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him
8334230 but since he did not have the means to repay his lord commanded him to be sold along with his wife and children and all that he had and repayment to be made
8334231 so the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him saying have patience with me and i will repay you everything
8334232 but that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and he seized him and began to choke him saying pay back what you owe
8334233 so his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him saying have patience with me and i will repay you
8334234 but he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed
8334235 so when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened
8334236 then summoning him his lord said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me
8334237 my heavenly father will also do the same to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart
8334238 an incensed and angry attitude of mind to ones neighbor
8334239 you must love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul and all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment a second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself all the other commandments and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments

8334278 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house
8334279 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8334280 we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
8334281 proud supporter of barack obama ms clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8334282 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8334283 i know a little bit about how the white house works and with michelle obama we are going to have someone who can answer that phone
8334284 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8334285 but let me be clear we do expect further attacks you dont have to look very hard to find proof that there are serious challenges to security across afghanistan
8334286 afghan citizens who are willing to take a stand against insurgents are the greatest weapons we possess in our fight against the taliban
8334287 mike brings a great deal of expertise on the defensive line
8334288 were excited to utilize his knowledge to help us in our quest for a grey cup
8334289 mainly our leads have been focusing within saskatchewan but were not going to discount the possibility and we are looking everywhere

8334291 i bring you good news of great joy for everyone 11 the savior yes the messiah the lord has been born tonight in bethlehem the city of david 12 and this is how you will recognize him you will find a baby lying in a manger wrapped snugly in strips of cloth
8334292 mighty hero the lord is with us why has all this happened to us and where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about didnt they say the lord brought us up out of egypt but now the lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the midianites
8334293 go with the strength you have and rescue israel from the midianites i am sending you
8334294 how can i rescue israel my clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of manasseh and i am the least in my entire family
8334295 i will be with you and you will destroy the midianites as if you were fighting against one man

8334298 the harmony of relationship that comes from reconciliation of a debt the state of things returned to what they were intended to be from the uncomfortable position of being out of harmony and place
8334299 in the state of completion that was intended by god
8334300 you were sealed in him with the holy spirit of promise who is given as a pledge of our inheritance
8334301 so dont worry about having enough food or drink or clothing
8334302 in the state of completion that was intended by god
8334303 in my opinion however the actions of the commonwealth were properly incidental to preventing the rescuees from landing in australian territory where they had no right to go their inability to go elsewhere derived from circumstances which did not come from any action on the part of the commonwealth the presence of sas troops on board the mv tampa did not itself or in combination with other factors constitute a detention
8334304 the counsel and solicitors acting in the interests of the rescuees in this case have evidently done so pro bono they have acted according to the highest ideals of the law they have sought to give voices to those who are perforce voiceless and on their behalf to hold the executive accountable for the lawfulness of its actions in so doing even if ultimately unsuccessful in the litigation they have served the rule of law and so the whole community
8334305 incoming chief justice robert french is godfather to kim beazleys daughter and he has proven that he is willing to apply the law without fear or favour
8334306 it came to this the first time you knowingly sentenced an innocent man

8334311 soon after the borders closed and a wall went up
8334312 i wanted to get away from everything and look for the meaning of life
8334313 i wanted to see if things were different on the other side of the world
8334314 its so simple yet its able to express so much
8334315 i wanted to explore the mentality of the people who produced this great art
8334316 i felt like a secret door had been opened to me and i saw treasures rarely glimpsed by westerners
8334317 my father had really changed and said he didnt want to know me anymore
8334318 everything was so alien i met many relatives but i had no memory of them
8334319 there are economical and political walls but there are emotional and psychological ones too
8334320 it is a mindset of not trusting people of closing yourself in and not believing anything
8334321 the love of beauty is so ingrained in the people here
8334322 everybody keeps saying my art is a gentle stroke on the heart that gives them hope hope truth light and what people have lost here
8334323 in taiwan i was loved and appreciated but here i have roots
8334324 fires are very rare but we still do fire drills all the time why shouldnt we train our kids about what they can do to survive an active shooter situation
8334325 we are a very safety conscious university now in any shooting the students are the first ones in the firing line however quickly law enforcement arrives so by showing students this video we are giving them a visual idea about what might happen and how to react when it does
8334326 if you look at virginia tech most of the shootings took place in a second floor classroom with windows the shooter came in shot a couple of people and then left he came back later and killed more of them if they had been thinking about their options properly they might very well have decided to climb out of the window
8334327 the difference between trained and untrained people in a crisis situation is that untrained ones will panic and maybe huddle together for support but if they were acting logically they might realise that if you have one gunman in a room full of 200 people the odds are very much in the favour of the 200 people
8334328 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8334329 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar and to sport the warning signs or red flags that mean a student is about to commit an act of violence some schools say it has changed their entire culture
8334330 its a terrible terrible idea something that everybody within the violence prevention profession should recoil against if you put a video programme like this out there it becomes just another thing for young people to copy it will produce what people call behaviour contagion become a training manual for violence
8334331 in order to make up the difference we must achieve a citywide water use reduction of approximately 20 percent
8334332 we have already slashed water usage by 20 percent for landscape and lighting districts local parks and city property and were continuing to monitor and correct any overflow problems in those areas
8334333 we are hoping that residents will recognize the seriousness of the drought and comply voluntarily
8334334 unfortunately the current circumstances require that we move beyond recommendations and impose some requirements
8334335 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8334336 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8334337 fannie and freddie are leading the way here though whether its a dead cat bounce or something more meaningful remains to be seen
8334338 financials have been beaten down pretty good lately so people may be just viewing this as a trading opportunity given current light volumes
8334339 you can hear the enthusiasm when they tell you yeah im coming
8334340 it makes perfect sense when you think about who we are
8334341 we cant really sit here and be comfortable with hosting one event a year
8334342 i think everybodys come to the conclusion that its found its little niche
8334343 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team
8334344 this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8334345 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8334346 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8334347 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8334348 we welcome derrick and will work hard to get him up to speed as quickly as possible
8334349 i know that derrick has been anxious to get here its good for him and also for us to have this done as we finish up the preseason and prepare to start the season
8334350 on that day september 11 we were at war and whenever weve been at war weve asked the american people to tighten their belt this time we didnt do that
8334351 there would have been more support for the effort globally if we would have said were going to sacrifice here are all those things we want to do to expand programs but were going to have to wait until the security of this nation is better assured if we would have done that we could have a balanced budget today
8334352 i debate every day so its not a matter of the debate
8334353 its about whether we have a credible candidate where there really needs to be an illumination of the issues or whether its just simply going to be a confrontation where there are personal attacks that fall out from that
8334354 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him
8334355 i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes
8334356 in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and he piledrove me thats just the way it is its just racing
8334357 carl is gonna apologize the way carl always does mr ed like
8334358 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8334359 were going to use them both johnson and depending on the game plans and it makes sense to take advantage of both of their abilities i think well have a better gauge once we get to the middle part of the season how the carries and the touches are going to work provided theyre healthy week in and week out i would assume it would be close to 50 50 maybe 60 40 white
8334360 its something i havent been able to do in the past year to go out and practice with no limitations i worked this morning and i wasnt as sore as i thought i would be its all positive that i can go out there back to back days im going to get some treatment and see how i feel tomorrow but as of right now i feel pretty good

8334365 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure were its heading
8334366 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8334367 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8334368 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8334369 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8334370 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8334371 do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
8334372 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part
8334373 indias annual gdp growth is expected to decelerate sharply to 7 9 per cent in 2008 amid slowing credit growth and higher interest rates
8334374 strong inflation will also squeeze household budgets hurting consumption growth in real terms
8334375 this revision is in continuation with the earlier forecasts made by the business intelligence arm of the economist group which clearly indicated the slowdown trend

8334378 this unrest will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8334379 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8334380 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8334381 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8334382 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8334383 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8334384 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8334385 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8334386 obviously lag will be a huge problem for online play were working on it compared to other games such as virtua fighter and soul calibur theyve got replay functions and so forth its quite difficult for 3d street fighter at the moment we still havent got a complete plan as yet were still working on it thats all we can say at the moment

8334425 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the u s
8334426 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8334427 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8334428 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead

8334432 clients will benefit from the combined scale and strength of our companies as they transform their technology environments
8334433 this is an important step forward in our ability to help them solve their challenges through practical innovations that deliver valuable business outcomes
8334434 it is ironic that at the very time the bush administration tried to cut back medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend childrens health coverage the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer sponsored health coverage
8334435 it demonstrates the importance that the next president should protect and not undermine the public health safety net
8334436 the census report also serves to highlight a key difference between the health care reform proposals of senators obama and mccain
8334437 senator obamas plan seeks to strengthen employer sponsored health insurance while senator mccains approach is designed to accelerate the erosion of health coverage in the workplace
8334438 it is important that meaningful health care reform becomes the top and earliest domestic priority of the next president and congress
8334439 the violence and anger in our society are growing i think people are realising now that we are at a critical stage

8334441 expressen first pixellized the indicted man and then made him white as if there was something wrong with being of different ethnic origin than white swedish in this case and the result is indeed that in addition to blurring patriks origin suspicion is being thrown away from him on to another group of people i do not have a good word for what i believe that this is apart from racism from expressen s page and in addition it is blatant manipulation which unfortunately is not an isolated case where attempts are made to try to conceal immigrants crimes by associating the offence committed with the ethnic swedes instead of immigrants in misunderstood care for immigrants

8334445 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8334446 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8334447 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised the constraints imposed on fda u s food and drug administration with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supplements make it difficult for the health of the american public to be adequately protected
8334448 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use
8334449 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered

8334453 as a society we cannot accept or tolerate these consequences we must do everything we can to avoid this harm within reason
8334454 we cannot ignore the position of a child sex offender who has served his sentence and has been released into the community
8334455 that person due to the nature of his or her convictions presents as a risk to the community but he or she is also a person who may be determined to re establish himself as a law abiding member of society
8334456 as a community we need to know what we can do to protect our children from sex offenders not just one individual who moves into a particular area

8334510 i have said to garry he has to play football
8334511 he didnt really get going at the end of last season but he has had a terrific pre season started the season very well and is a very good striker who is on form as far as the past i have never had any problems with garry and i dont anticipate i will
8334512 if we can pick four points up i think that would be very good
8334513 if they can play we will be pushing it through because it is so important for the country i think club managers will realise that for a world cup game we want to do our best to get the best possible team we can out there

8334517 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8334518 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8334519 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8334520 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8334521 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation

8334762 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8334763 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8334764 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8334765 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52

8334840 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8334841 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8334842 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8334843 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8334844 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8334845 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8334846 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8334847 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect

8334850 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8334851 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8334852 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8334853 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8334854 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe

8334860 a growing number of people are demanding more from the businesses that produce and sell the goods they buy not only do they feel they have the right to a high quality product they want to know that the company they buy from is transparent and honest about how those goods reach the shelves
8334861 they want the story behind the product that assures them that the company has treated its suppliers fairly and that it has done its best to take into account its impact on the environment and that perhaps someone has actually benefited from the manufacture of that product
8334862 the retail world is going to have to take notice of this powerful group of consumers if they respond to the expectations of the eco shopper everyone will benefit customers suppliers the planet and the businesses themselves it is a win win for everyone
8334863 the power of the internet and word of mouth is immense we know from our findings that personal recommendations amongst friends families and colleagues are extremely effective

8334973 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
8334974 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

8335039 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8335040 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8335041 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

8335077 the central focus of technology transfer as a means of economic stimulation and regeneration for almost every university community is a hot topic
8335078 its really clear to everyone that the university owns technical property coming into the exchange but theres also value and intellectual property owned by the entrepreneurship students who articulate value propositions and create the commercialization plan
8335079 when an inventor discloses an invention to otc we direct them to the program that we think can most successfully bring their ideas to fully realized products

8335087 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8335088 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8335089 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8335090 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8335091 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8335092 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8335093 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8335094 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8335095 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers

8335134 wilkinson established a firearms factory in a small suburb of reading that was able to meet the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8335135 these are attractive items for those connected to organised criminal networks if you have one of these readily available you will be targeted by other criminals who want to take it off you
8335136 one of the integral problems with these weapons is they do not necessarily hit your intended target they also have difficulty stopping and starting them they go off and they are difficult to keep in single fire
8335137 we can see very clearly the devastating impact of this heinous crime particularly and disproportionately although not exclusively on black communities
8335138 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8335139 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days

8335205 running against john mccains policies in 2008 is like running against bourbon at a temperance convention
8335206 sometimes your friends are dead wrong and on the big issues this november john mccain is as dead wrong as you can be joe biden thinks the war in iraq has been a huge mistake while john mccain would do it all over again
8335207 to his credit john repudiates some of the bush administrations approach to the world
8335208 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
8335209 john mccain and joe biden said send more troops we need more troops
8335210 was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
8335211 i believe that there is no separation between george bush and john mccain when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
8335212 i dont care what john mccain says he is not going to push that agenda hard
8335213 would not be happening without leadership from both parties over the years senator mccain joined senator lieberman in introducing the first senate cap and trade legislation
8335214 i believe if neither he nor i were senators and i picked up a phone and called him and said i need you to show up at such and such a place i cant tell you why he would be there
8335215 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who

8335219 shredding sensitive paper documents is an important first step but it doesnt end there
8335220 thats why bbb experts will also be distributing important advice and simple steps everyone can take to prevent id theft in their daily lives both online and off
8335221 our goal here is to make the information less accessible and empower people to be their own first line of defense against identity theft with community based bbbs across north america collaborating for an in market event like this well have a tremendous coast to coast presence that will reach a lot of people and hopefully stop a lot of theft
8335222 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8335223 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8335224 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8335225 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8335226 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8335227 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8335228 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8335229 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
8335230 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8335231 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8335232 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8335233 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8335234 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8335235 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8335236 americas ability to compete in the 21st century global economy depends in large part on the math and science skills of our workforce
8335237 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8335238 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8335239 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8335240 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8335241 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8335242 now it becomes clear bulgarias accession to the eu was the right choice bulgaria is extremely useful for us with its contacts in the black sea region
8335243 direct abortion that is abortion willed as an end or as a means always constitutes a grave moral disorder since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being paragraph 62

8335270 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season the club have made some great signings and sheva will fit in without any problems
8335271 i cant say if ive been included in the shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to chelsea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8335272 there is a specific amount which tottenham have offered it suits us
8335273 provided roman agrees on a contract with the british side we are ready to release him
8335274 more than that i believe that such proposals do not often come for a footballer maybe once in their lifetime
8335275 and if roman plays in england this will be good for himself and for the team
8335276 i have firmly decided to sign a contract with tottenham
8335277 formalities are almost settled and in a day or two ill be a player in the english club
8335278 hes got a decent left foot and will add balance on the left side the boys got talent
8335279 when he became available i put it to the chairman
8335280 gareth made a decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8335281 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8335282 any talks regarding a potential new contract and aston villa will not be taking place until the end of the season
8335283 gareth wants to concentrate on playing to the best of his ability this season we hope this draws a line under the matter

8335310 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8335311 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8335312 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first

8335322 my fundamental models indicate that the oil industry is where the best values in the market are
8335323 the economy and stock market have gone through a legitimate crisis because of the credit woes and it takes time for something like that to work itself out
8335324 but the important thing to remember is that weve been through financial crises before even bad debt financial crises like this one and the market has always stabilized and then pushed higher
8335325 and history has shown that those who can stick with the stock market through down times like these will be rewarded
8335326 david dreman one of the gurus i base my strategies on notes in his recent forbes column if you pack up now chances are youll miss a good part of the next bull market
8335327 meanwhile houston based w amp t offshore gets approval from the contrarian strategy i base on the writings of david dreman dreman targets stocks with strong fundamentals whose prices dont reflect the strength of their numbers usually because of fear or apathy
8335328 w amp t is involved in oil and natural gas acquisition exploitation and exploration mostly in the gulf of mexico area
8335329 the company has working interests in about 200 fields in state and federal waters and interests in leases that cover about 2 billion acres it has taken in more than 1 4 billion in sales over the past 12 months and has a market cap of 2 7 billion
8335330 w amp t is considered a contrarian stock using this model because its p e ratio 9
8335331 one way dreman looks for strong fundamentals is by examining eps growth he likes to see companies whose eps have risen lately and w amp ts eps over the past two quarters 1 05 and most recently 1 77 meet that requirement
8335332 in addition the companys growth rate over the past six months 210 52 has beaten the s amp ps growth rate 4 57 and its projected eps growth for the current year is 241 76
8335333 that means the stock has been growing earnings more quickly than the s amp p and is likely to continue that trend in the near future meeting another of my dreman based requirements
8335334 dreman also likes companies that have the ability to raise their payout ratio w amp ts current payout ratio of 13 21 is below its historical payout ratio 13 8 indicating that the company could raise its dividend a bit in the future a good sign
8335335 another dreman type measure of financial soundness is pre tax profit margin my dreman based model looks for companies with pre tax profit margins of at least 8 and considers anything over 22 percent to be phenomenal with a margin of 31 68 w amp t passes with flying colors

8335412 if nothing else it revealed another potential weakness of the system capable of tying the countrys transportation network in knots
8335413 but they expect them from weather the occasional mechanical problem or congestion the fact that a system like this can fail and be supported by limited back up suggests there is considerable room for improvement
8335414 with airline cutbacks in the number of flights to some cities missing a connection can mean spending an extra night on the road plus you have aircrews who are reaching their maximum hours for flight and might not be able to fly after a 90 minute delay
8335415 acte has warned repeatedly that this system and all other components of the air traffic control system atc need to be assigned a much higher priority for replacement
8335416 the most pressing need is for the continued guarantee of passenger safety but there are commercial considerations here as well a new air traffic control system would enable planes to fly more direct routes using less gas and generating less congestion benefitting both passengers and airlines alike
8335417 this incident is yet another reminder of how dependent air travel in this country is on an antiquated air traffic control system airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations its time we overhauled the system
8335418 the news that the federal aviation administration has experienced a communications failure that has delayed flights across the eastern united states once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system unless action is taken now the breakdowns of today will become all too common in the future

8335493 its a big season for us obviously with the change of coach
8335494 this team has been building for the last three years and we really need to take another step forward
8335495 well be looking to finish in the top four in the premiership guaranteeing qualification for the heineken cup
8335496 and well be looking to win silverware and win that challenge cup
8335497 its been a tough summer and we cant wait for the season to start
8335498 weve been training very hard over the summer with the new rules they want us to be as light as we possibly can be without losing strength and power so ive shed a few kilos
8335499 were just trying to adapt to them elvs weve had two pre season games now and were almost on top of them i think
8335500 weve trained with them for the last 12 weeks so we know them and its just a matter of training your mind to do that in games
8335501 its going to be very tough but thats what we want
8335502 we want as tough pre season friendlies as we can get which will set us up because were playing the guinness premiership champions first up so it will be a great test for our boys
8335503 its something which were very much looking forward to taking on the european champions in their own back yard
8335504 boy do you want to go to hell or to god
8335505 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8335506 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3 billion
8335507 it seems more and more unlikely that these technical service contracts can be implemented now in such a short remaining time
8335508 we are working at increasing our production hopefully by another 500 000 bpd by the middle of next year
8335509 different parliamentary blocs still have serious differences about the law
8335510 i have not heard anything new from the parliament to make me expect that the law will be passed any time soon

8335513 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8335514 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8335515 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8335516 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8335517 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8335518 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8335519 the problems have been focused particularly on the construction and land development loans and thats not a surprise
8335520 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that
8335521 and it would be cool for me to do were still trying to put it together
8335522 so does barack obama have a problem with white voters
8335523 i feel very proud of them i came today to support them because they have done something great
8335524 i am really proud and excited as it shows the scottish people can do it when they put their hearts and souls into it
8335525 many scots have made a huge mark on the world but the scots dont often recognise their own achievements
8335526 i made the trip today to come here because chris is my hero i thought he did so well winning his medals i watched all of the olympics so im really excited to be here
8335527 albertas economy led primarily by the energy and natural resources sectors continues to boom and employers are granting higher pay increases to reflect this growth
8335528 organizations in other areas such as ontario where the manufacturing sector is struggling are facing the challenges of a tightening economy
8335529 our partnership with adeq is yet another example of the uas goal of working to achieve a sustainable campus
8335530 managing the flow of waste at these large public events is made considerably easier by involving wildcat fans directly through education and community involvement
8335531 the recycling program has been a huge success among ua fans
8335532 a lot of items being thrown away at sporting events can be recycled this program is not only a great way to increase recycling at ua events it reminds people who attend the events of the benefits of recycling and helps them make recycling a part of everyday life

8335537 mmmm making love making love for two making love for two minutes when its with me you only need two minutes cause im so
8335538 then you tell me you want some more well im not surprised but im quite sleepy
8335539 whod want private sentiments to someone they loved revealed lawyers sent a warning she hopes it will work
8335540 entirely a website business there were not many newspapers there
8335541 just think about this in four months we will have an administration that actually believes in science
8335542 not from racial composition per se but from the better educational background and higher educational aspirations that are on average found among whites
8335543 study after study shows that any positive benefit derived from going to a neighborhood school is totally wiped out by issues of poverty weve been screaming this at the top of our lungs
8335544 the churches were fighting and couldnt agree on things and we were asked to come in as a kind of liaison
8335545 focus on the unique historic character of nashvilles oldest ethnic neighborhood and showcase the diverse cultural population that is defining its redevelopment
8335546 basically the only difference is that the neighborhood will get all the money for the race instead of splitting it with the churches
8335547 well continue to get the proceeds for the homes tour the two churches will split their food and beverage proceeds and well keep our food and beverage proceeds so its basically just a larger festival
8335548 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
8335549 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
8335550 the foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult long require coordination and arent necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost
8335551 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community
8335552 im not the cop here on this stuff and i would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do
8335553 weve expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members
8335554 we have more board level representation from smaller organizations and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the osdl
8335555 my goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation
8335556 so no single entity dominates the organization and i think weve achieved that
8335557 they serve a great purpose in bringing together the community commercial linux companies and end users and they represent the interests of each group very well we have a very close relationship with jim and were very pleased with the direction hes taken the linux foundation
8335558 they the linux foundation try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development
8335559 in general they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers in general from what we can see the development community is neutral to positive about the linux foundation
8335560 i t is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us these laws taken in the largest sense being growth and reproduction inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less imprved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows there is a grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved

8335580 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8335581 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8335582 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8335583 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8335584 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8335585 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8335586 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet

8335634 the lock to my house doesnt work so i guess ill just never go outside again
8335635 once beth came along i started to get some traction
8335636 people really liked forget cassettes instruments of action so that put my name out there a little bit
8335637 it really started when de novo dahl approached me about releasing the record after cats amp kittens which became move every muscle make every sound
8335638 it was really good so i suggested that we put it out there and see if anyone else would be interested in releasing it then the roadrunner deal fell on the table and i started to take on a more management role with them the exact same thing happened with beth she got involved with a european label one little indian which has the sugar cubes and bj rk and all those bands once we did the licensing deal with salt i started to take on a more management role
8335639 i think over the next few years it will become less theory 8 records or theory 8 management it will just be theory 8
8335640 i want it to be a platform its becoming harder to define a labels role in breaking a band with the industry the way that it is its all about getting the music to the next level
8335641 bands in this town are constantly making really good records
8335642 but the whole infrastructure isnt really in place to promote them ive learned that the hard way there are millions of great records just sitting in stores so instead of looking at everything on this huge national scale like how can i be the next merge its more like how can i get this artist the right amount of exposure so that people will get excited about it and maybe look at our other artists
8335643 i return to tennessee even more convinced that we need to drill here and drill now
8335644 well your r sum looks great wait is that a zombie jesus feasting on a babys brains on your neck
8335645 we take allegations of use of ku facilities for illegal activity seriously and strongly condemn any such activity
8335646 law enforcement was contacted immediately when the university became aware of the activity
8335647 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing
8335648 hes still young but he has over 160 games under his belt so he has experience hes learning his trade
8335649 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland
8335650 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8335651 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a chance
8335652 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8335653 well increase the pressure slowly we know he did some exercises in donaustauf but its important to go forward step by step
8335654 we know we are in a battle and i have every confidence in paul as has club chairman andy appleby and the three of us together are quite resolute in our belief it can be turned around
8335655 we are not underestimating the disquiet and we know the supporters are extremely unhappy all i can say is that we are working as hard as we can to turn it around
8335656 we have always had full confidence in paul jewell and that has not changed in the slightest we are going to have to be big boys take the stick and sort it out
8335657 we are not out of the woods but it is a step in the right direction as much as you cannot get two disheartened about a couple of defeats in the league you cannot get too excited about a victory
8335658 as soon as we win a league game the monkey will be off our back
8335659 crumbs of comfort are what we are after at the moment
8335660 you could see in patches the nervousness the lack of confidence that was there at times but we became more confident as the game went on having started the match a bit edgy
8335661 there was a spring in their step once they had scored i said to them dont be frightened of scoring another
8335662 we can watch as many videos get as many psychologists as we want but there is only one way to make confidence and that is by winning football matches
8335663 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8335664 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8335665 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this

8335667 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8335668 so much for leading the thought leaders but what about john q public again the serial exaggerators at pcrm arent making any friends at a time in our political season when doom and gloom messages usually give way to hope and optimism hint cancer isnt terribly uplifting we looked at the online comments of more than two dozen newspapers and tv stations that reprinted the ap story and heres what we found eating a vegetarian a day reduces your future risk of being bothered by idiots more junk science from peta wasnt it just a few weeks ago that i couldnt have tomatoes or jalapenos without the fear of getting sick eat what you like folks life is too short not enjoy it to the fullest and that includes food
8335669 you mean hot dogs will kill me so will everything else last i heard we all die
8335670 there is nothing wrong with trying to improve nutrition especially for kids but
8335671 someone tell me the difference between what these people are doing and our government officials recalling 9 11 to get people to vote
8335672 in the arctic seems to be happening before their eyes sea ice in the is at its second lowest level in about 30 years
8335673 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8335674 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8335675 how would i respond if i were david and i found out that because of me 85 priests of the lord were new dead

8335680 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8335681 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8335682 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8335683 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8335684 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8335685 what give you some of the money that we get from sony ok that sounds like a cool deal
8335686 i am a great admirer of the state of new jersey and i will come to any event thats schedule that any of you invite me to
8335687 i just want you to know that this facility is further away from the sheraton than any geographic point in new jersey is from new york so if i can get here i can get to your event
8335688 to really understand john mccain how obtuse he is how distant he is we have to take a look at what they call in physics the parallax effect when something is so far away that you cant even measure you take an object thats a little closer and knowing the distance between you and that object you can now assess how far away the third body is
8335689 its not even comparing him to barack obama because that would be like comparing zero to infinity
8335690 but comparing him to president bush you know john mccain is not only not in our solar system but is far away in a distant galaxy
8335691 it is easy to come across the bridge to new jersey any time

8335710 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days

8335715 not worried about it theres places besides denver where we need and will get clintons help winning this election
8335716 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8335717 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything
8335718 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8335719 what his strategy is to go around drumming stuff on obama his crazy quotes and hes cultivated a careful reputation for being eccentric and therefore hillary is not blamed for what he does and the result is he can go around and dump on obama and almost be like a negative greek chorus
8335720 to defeat barack obama and make sure hillary can get elected in 2012

8335764 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8335765 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8335766 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8335767 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8335768 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8335769 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8335770 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8335771 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8335772 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8335773 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8335774 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8335775 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients

8335779 time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8335780 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8335781 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8335782 we recognize there needs to be a balance between imports and domestic production in russia
8335783 i feel very proud of them i came today to support them because they have done something great

8335801 the doctor said moshi is ready to go home today
8335802 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated blood pressure although not representing a fully developed strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8335803 this outbreak is really taxing us and we think a provincial consensus is needed to determine whether we should just resign ourselves to large numbers of cases or determine what to do to mitigate the spread through some sort of immunization campaign
8335804 after all this is not a trivial disease weve had many cases resulting in hospitalizations and complications like deafness meningitis and testicular involvement which can cause sterility
8335805 theres no guarantee it wont spread to the vancouver region

8335808 were evaluating and reviewing the future for the course and what are our options and opportunities
8335809 the economy certainly has gone through some changes since we acquired the course
8335810 i have had continued interest there has been a lot of looking at it and a lot of thinking about it
8335811 this is not a property that somebody comes along and says oh ill buy that and do something with it it requires a lot of planning and forethought
8335812 this year with other golf courses ceasing operations im optimistic that the course is doing real well
8335813 its certainly getting a lot of appreciation from people who talk to me

8335818 but until i get that i cant give any more news
8335819 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet
8335820 the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8335821 he wright phillips doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8335822 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8335823 he is speaking with the manager luiz felipe scolari at the moment but he is settled in london he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8335824 we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more
8335825 if it doesnt happen it wont be for want of trying
8335826 hes a player that i know obviously i worked with him at blackburn and wales so i know what he could offer us
8335827 but i think west ham came out yesterday quite strongly in their response to any interest that anybody has shown
8335828 so i think it would be more difficult to make that one happen
8335829 that tells us that users are finding what theyre looking for theyre trusting the search engine more and theyre broadening their usage of the search box
8335830 were not seeing it yet in terms of a real growth in the number of searches users are doing through the main search box
8335831 which should bring the coverage rates right up to about 100 percent
8335832 its hard to imagine that other than misspellings and really far reaching queries we wouldnt have an answer between the mobile search index the targeted transcoded drawl and the full web search index
8335833 theres a significant amount of coverage in the sponsored links and the percentage of times we return at least one sponsored link
8335834 thats a validation that the advertisers are finding highly qualified traffic and theyre raising their bid prices to compete for that traffic

8335843 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8335844 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8335845 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8335846 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8335847 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8335848 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8335849 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8335850 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years

8335861 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8335862 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8335863 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8335864 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8335865 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe

8335880 the huge turnout at the royal mile is a sign of how proud edinburgh people are of our athletes and of the massive impact that chris hoy has made on the global stage

8335882 anyone whos been to an olympics would agree its the most inspirational exciting thing to be part of
8335883 the thing is i dont see what the big deal is about being a female geek i obviously do not have a problem with female gamers or female bloggers but i dont understand why some women seem to think this is such important distinction for their blog

8335930 lindy and i stopped in cheyenne wyoming on the way back from oregon to seek out the place where leo connellan ate steak across the street from the bus station the bus station is gone but there is a tourist information center nearby and we located a woman who has been in cheyenne long enough to remember it having been there she said the albany hotel had to be the place where he dined
8335931 the place where the bus stop stands is now some generic touristy plaza and parking lot with some cutesy cowboy boot sculptures the woman said that the bus station came down because it was under an old overpass that collapsed when someone crashed into one of its support columns

8335937 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8335938 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8335939 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people

8335949 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8335950 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8335951 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8335952 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals

8335955 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8335956 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8335957 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8335958 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8335959 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be

8335971 obama cherishes his life story as a unique saga but the drama of a fatherless childs rise to temporal power driven by ambition a hunger for control and an appetite for the approval of others is a familiar one in american politics
8335972 i think to put yourself through what is a pretty rigorous process of running for president youve got to have learned to set up some pretty high expectations for yourself
8335973 somethings got to be driving you and in my case if you have somebody that is absent maybe you feel like youve got something to prove when youre young and that pattern sets itself up over time but also because again in my case the stories i heard about my father painted him as larger than life which also meant that i felt i had something to live up to you could argue that if youre too well adjusted you dont end up running for president
8335974 so if the pattern sets in pretty early on where youre pushing your comfort level it probably has to do with those very early influences and that can come from either the absence or the presence of a father who ends up motivating you in some way
8335975 while communities like thunder bay continue to bleed jobs at an alarming rate and ontarios economy flounders the mcguinty liberals would rather make feel good announcements than come up with a real plan
8335976 unfortunately dalton mcguinty seems to be on a permanent vacation when it comes to the issues that matter most to ontarians be it the economy public safety or upholding the rule of law
8335977 too many of our municipalities many right here in northern ontario are struggling to stay afloat while waiting for a better long term deal from the mcguinty liberals
8335978 ontarios municipalities deserve more respect and a real partnership from the provincial government
8335979 the slightest sense of urgency would be welcome from mr mcguinty on issues ranging from safety on the trans canada highway to ignored recommendations of the forestry report from the future of atikokan to the impact that the provinces endangered species legislation will have on resource industries doing nothing and hoping for the best wont get people back to work
8335980 we can all help to keep kids safe while they walk in their communities
8335981 when drivers slow down and when parents take every opportunity to teach their children about pedestrian safety these injuries can be prevented
8335982 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8335983 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8335984 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8335985 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8335986 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the republican party
8335987 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8335988 if this election is going to be as close as the polls indicate joe biden doesnt change the map at all
8335989 the closure comes following a further deterioration of the situation in the area where the clinic is located
8335990 there has been a notable increase in violence including mortars landing close to the clinic
8335991 until now the worlds response to the catastrophe has been massively inadequate
8335992 gherao is completely illegal and immoral it will not be allowed in this state it is our contribution to the english language

8335994 we are discussing and debating among ourselves and my colleagues in delhi are also changing the old dogmas will have to change
8335995 that investors may think the worst of the market downturn may be over
8335996 he did it he tried to kill him he wasnt successful
8335997 there but for the grace of god is a murderer
8335998 you know that a crime was committed the question is who committed the crime
8335999 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8336000 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8336001 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8336002 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8336003 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8336004 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8336005 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8336006 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8336007 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8336008 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers
8336009 why cant you just talk about trivial things everything has been going just fine lately and here you go again just digging and digging

8336021 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
8336022 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8336023 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
8336024 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
8336025 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
8336026 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
8336027 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
8336028 i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
8336029 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8336030 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8336031 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8336032 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8336033 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8336034 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
8336035 there were women losing badly in the first round of olympic events who appeared to have better conditioning than many female tennis players making a very comfortable living on th twta our perhaps the lta could have a look at ms romero and ms pendleton to see the level of fitness expected of world class performers
8336036 lets hope ak pulls it together for the third set
8336037 ketika aku mengutus kamu dengan tiada membawa pundi pundi bekal dan kasut adakah kamu kekurangan apa apa
8336038 lihat aku mengutus kamu seperti domba ke tengah tengah serigala sebab itu hendaklah kamu cerdik seperti ular dan tulus seperti merpati
8336039 tetapi seorang dari mereka yang menyertai yesus mengulurkan tangannya menghunuskan pedangnya dan meletakkannya kepada hamba imam besar sehingga putus telinganya
8336040 duduklah di sini sementara aku pergi ke sana untuk berdoa
8336041 dan ia membawa petrus dan kedua anak zebedeus bersamanya lalu katanya kepada mereka tinggallah di sini dan berjaga jagalah dengan aku
8336042 ia sangat ketakutan dan makin bersungguh sungguh berdoa peluhnya menjadi seperti titik titik darah yang bertetesan ke tanah
8336043 maka jika matamu yang kanan menyesatkan engkau cukillah dan buanglah itu dan jika tanganmu yang kanan menyesatkan engkau maka penggallah dan buanglah itu karena lebih baik bagimu jika satu dari anggota tubuhmu binasa daripada tubuhmu yang utuh masuk neraka
8336044 the speaker has been an advocate for increasing our countrys energy independence and for renewable energy for years long before this purchase
8336045 the ethics rules are so incredibly narrow that unless you are pushing or voting for something that will impact only you it doesnt count as a conflict

8336092 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8336093 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8336094 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8336095 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8336096 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8336097 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8336098 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8336099 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8336100 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8336101 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8336102 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8336103 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8336104 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8336105 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8336106 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8336107 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8336108 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8336109 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8336110 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8336111 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8336112 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8336113 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8336114 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8336115 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8336116 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8336117 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8336118 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8336119 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8336120 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8336121 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8336122 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8336123 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8336124 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8336125 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8336126 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8336127 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8336128 there are at least two companies seriously interested in purchasing sfiv machines from us but no done deals at the moment

8336134 they think they know whats right and everyone else is wrong on everything
8336135 you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8336136 shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe
8336137 hillary looked as if she were straining at the bit to announce her 2012 exploratory committee

8336141 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8336142 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8336143 my fundamental models indicate that the oil industry is where the best values in the market are
8336144 the economy and stock market have gone through a legitimate crisis because of the credit woes and it takes time for something like that to work itself out
8336145 but the important thing to remember is that weve been through financial crises before even bad debt financial crises like this one and the market has always stabilized and then pushed higher
8336146 and history has shown that those who can stick with the stock market through down times like these will be rewarded
8336147 david dreman one of the gurus i base my strategies on notes in his recent forbes column if you pack up now chances are youll miss a good part of the next bull market
8336148 meanwhile houston based w amp t offshore gets approval from the contrarian strategy i base on the writings of david dreman dreman targets stocks with strong fundamentals whose prices dont reflect the strength of their numbers usually because of fear or apathy
8336149 w amp t is involved in oil and natural gas acquisition exploitation and exploration mostly in the gulf of mexico area
8336150 the company has working interests in about 200 fields in state and federal waters and interests in leases that cover about 2 billion acres it has taken in more than 1 4 billion in sales over the past 12 months and has a market cap of 2 7 billion
8336151 w amp t is considered a contrarian stock using this model because its p e ratio 9
8336152 one way dreman looks for strong fundamentals is by examining eps growth he likes to see companies whose eps have risen lately and w amp ts eps over the past two quarters 1 05 and most recently 1 77 meet that requirement
8336153 in addition the companys growth rate over the past six months 210 52 has beaten the s amp ps growth rate 4 57 and its projected eps growth for the current year is 241 76
8336154 that means the stock has been growing earnings more quickly than the s amp p and is likely to continue that trend in the near future meeting another of my dreman based requirements
8336155 dreman also likes companies that have the ability to raise their payout ratio w amp ts current payout ratio of 13 21 is below its historical payout ratio 13 8 indicating that the company could raise its dividend a bit in the future a good sign
8336156 another dreman type measure of financial soundness is pre tax profit margin my dreman based model looks for companies with pre tax profit margins of at least 8 and considers anything over 22 percent to be phenomenal with a margin of 31 68 w amp t passes with flying colors
8336157 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8336158 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem

8336162 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8336163 we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so
8336164 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8336165 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8336166 ukraine is a buffer zone between europe and russia which has energy resources and could pull the plug on europe nato membership would be very provocative because of the russian fleet in sebastopol so maybe its better not to join at the moment
8336167 russia did what was necessary to protect its people if they hadnt protected the ossetians it would have been worse
8336168 we aim to enter the pan european system of security because we are convinced that today there is no other alternative way of protecting ukraines territorial integrity her sovereignty

8336170 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8336171 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8336172 es lamentable que por un lado hablen de libre pensamiento y de cero ataduras a partidos pol ticos sin embargo este caso lo manejaron como un partido tradicional hablando de reglamentos y sanciones la actuaci n del ppr fue muy decepcionante
8336173 si finalmente el tribunal determina que estos cinco hombres no pueden formar parte del ppr yo los voy a recibir con una alfombra roja para que hagan su ingreso oficial al equipo del cambio en san juan

8336191 i think she gave a very good speech from her point of view and our point of view but not necessarily for barack obamas point of view
8336192 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8336193 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8336194 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8336195 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8336196 good but not quite very good for barack obama in 2008 even better if things should turn out like they might for hillary clinton in 2012
8336197 what was missing was much in the way of description of barack obama what kind of man is he one who supports the same positions she does
8336198 has she looked deep into his heart and found something worthy no evidence here that she had would he be a good commander in chief not a word on that as the mccain campaign quickly and gleefully noted
8336199 the first time since 1976 that a convention has been more excited about a loser than a winner
8336200 those two both need for obama to lose and theyre going to do whatever they can after they leave denver to see that that happens
8336201 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8336202 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8336203 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8336204 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8336205 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8336206 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8336207 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8336208 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8336209 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family

8336215 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8336216 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8336217 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8336218 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8336219 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you

8336276 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

8336478 its going to be a bigger problem now than it was in the first half of this year but its going to continue on for probably at least a nine month period
8336479 seamlessly handle the refinancing of short term debt maturities as a result of our prudent liquidity planning
8336480 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8336481 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8336482 the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon
8336483 riskier institutions so that safer institutions wont be unduly burdened
8336484 however we expect to see some migration to areas experiencing the greatest stress
8336485 we hope to market it certainly in the third quarter
8336486 i think were going to be marketing it both as a whole bank as well as in pieces
8336487 would put more pressure on the treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the gses
8336488 the treasury would opt for one of the earlier options to avoid
8336489 would put more pressure on the treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the gses
8336490 the treasury would opt for one of the earlier options to avoid such an outcome
8336491 would be an entirely management event in the context of the federal budget
8336492 this is the next step in a process aimed at recouping the losses adcb has already incurred and additionally this is an important step in paving the way for other gcc investors to ensure they are provided an opportunity to recover their own losses
8336493 adcb has taken a proactive early lead to protect itself and other investors
8336494 i consider it good news that youre seeing price declines decelerate
8336495 while the markets havent reached bottom were getting closer to there
8336496 you need to see something slow down before it turns back up
8336497 we cannot declare that weve hit the bottom and are on our way back up
8336498 boston and denvers monthly increases were in excess of 1 percent and both were up three consecutive months
8336499 charlotte n c and dallas were both up for four consecutive months
8336500 it is still the case that california metro areas are among the worst in the country
8336501 the situation is essentially as bad as in las vegas phoenix and miami
8336502 the index doesnt necessarily tell you what has happened to the value of your average home that did not sell
8336503 it is really affected by the characteristics of those homes that are actually selling
8336504 had to have all their is dotted and ts crossed so they didnt have some of the problems weve seen in the broader market
8336505 there was no incentive for fidelity to promote auction rate securities
8336506 held responsible to provide liquidity for all purchasers of auction rate securities not just their own customers
8336507 very small percentage of investors bought auction rate securities from fidelity
8336508 lawyer speak for permitting them to defend private lawsuits by third parties who would otherwise be entitled to use the settlement as evidence of liability
8336509 they may see lower rents and they will have more trouble leasing vacant properties
8336510 n things and casual dining chain bennigans while not every store owned by a bankrupt chain will close its doors companies are asking for lower rents and other concessions as part of their reorganization plans
8336511 the smaller tenants are all approaching developers and telling them that theyre not doing well and they need rent relief
8336512 if you are an investor that doesnt have to spend you are sitting on the sidelines waiting for prices to soften even more
8336513 i dont see any reason this would turn around before the summer of 09
8336514 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
8336515 people said hold it we dont want our infrastructure owned by foreigners
8336516 our concern is that some sources of financing see this as a quick opportunity to make money
8336517 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing
8336518 it thinks there is a boatload of capital and when it is politically convenient it will be able to take advantage of it but the capital is going into infrastructure assets available today around the world and not waiting for projects the u s the public sector may sponsor in the future
8336519 look at the physical neglect crumbling bridges the issue of energy security environmental concerns
8336520 its more relevant than ever and we have no vision
8336521 we are facing an infrastructure crisis in this country that threatens our status as an economic superpower and threatens the health and safety of the people we serve
8336522 our infrastructure is crumbling from bridges in minnesota to our airports and freeways
8336523 you can see and understand the businesses involved for example ships come into the port unload containers reload containers and leave
8336524 ten to 20 years from now infrastructure could be larger than real estate
8336525 the fact that the private sector raised 1 4 billion for the beltway project shows that even projects like hot lanes that are considered high risk can be developed and financed privately and that has huge implications for other large metro areas
8336526 will all public agencies think its worth the extra return private capital will demand
8336527 while goldman sachs is less exposed to mortgage write downs industry wide decline in flow business coupled with vulnerability to equity market directionality stemming from principal investment activities has exacerbated exceedingly difficult market backdrop
8336528 undervalue prospect of significant return on equity outperformance over next 18 to 24 months
8336529 theres a handful of firms out there pimco being one of them that are well positioned to deal with this credit crisis and the fire sales going on in mortgage backed securities
8336530 one of the most extraordinary things weve seen with pimco over the past year is that theyve invested in high quality mortgage backed securities across the board
8336531 theyve been calling for a housing slowdown before the term subprime became popular in cocktail party conversations
8336532 by artificially supporting the market the ecb may be crowding out private purchasers
8336533 the collateral that we take must also be traded in the market because only then is it priced accurately
8336534 we aim at taking final decisions in autumn which will be communicated immediately
8336535 everything is coming to a head at the same time
8336536 the euros surge over the past two years has caught up weve seen a hollowing out of the euro areas industrial sector an oil shock and tightening credit conditions made worse by the european central banks decision to raise rates in june
8336537 i get the feeling that the mandate of the ecb is based on the notion that controlling inflation in a modern industrial economy is enough with no further need for anything else this not a view that is accepted any longer in economic circles central banks should not try to reverse oil supply shocks
8336538 you could say that every political entity gets the central bank it deserves
8336539 the presumption is that holders of capital have lost their money
8336540 risk of a loss of confidence in the baltic currencies and their banking systems triggering widespread conversion and withdrawal of deposits
8336541 never before on record has poverty been higher and median income for working age households lower at the end of a multi year economic expansion than in the previous recession
8336542 the data are now clear that for poverty and median income this was the worst economic expansion on record
8336543 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8336544 at the very time the bush administration tried to cut back medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend childrens health coverage the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer sponsored health coverage
8336545 with the highest unemployment rate in the nation im not surprised some of these are people who counted on those assembly line jobs
8336546 they staked their entire future on the auto industry the decline of the auto industry has sent shock waves through the entire community
8336547 poverty tends to hit women and children hardest my definition of poverty is a lack of options people come to mel trotter because they are out of options
8336548 michigan relative to the nation appears to be doing the worst the only state in the nation where poverty actually increased was michigan
8336549 these are people who are spreading out their food so they are only eating once a day
8336550 these are really dire conditions where people are making decisions that are really untenable
8336551 we have seen over the last decade a whittling away of our safety net the programs that were in place to help people in economic downturns have been whittling away
8336552 the deteriorating book increases the chances that taxpayers ultimately might have to shoulder some of the cost
8336553 at this stage granite is performing within its parameters investors bondholders are well aware of this and are protected by the reserve fund a cushion that protects bondholders in the event of default
8336554 of course wed like to see the government help the market but our view is slightly different to some other companies
8336555 even if it did intervene through measures like a stamp duty holiday or a fall in interest rates we still think the market would be in a difficult position its not something the government alone can fix
8336556 its not something we have ruled out but we are focussing on sorting out our covenants
8336557 we look at the overall quality of employment and were surprised to see that it has improved despite the weakening economy
8336558 one of the reasons for that was the fact that a lot of the new jobs were in the public sector which has relatively high quality jobs
8336559 this probably will not last the days that governments run high surpluses are over in fact i would expect government hiring to slow down significantly over the next two to three years
8336560 that means you will not see government jobs offsetting losses in the private sector so the canadian market will be exposed to its weakness this time both quality and quantity of jobs will go down because of the softening in hiring by governments
8336561 the public sector as a percentage of employment is critical in terms of how that impacts our economy and our labour market and we need to be focusing on reducing that further than 19 per cent rather than being pleased with 19
8336562 when you look at place like nevada wisconsin and massachusetts theyre all sitting at 10 or 11 per cent of employment alberta has canadas smallest public sector at about 15 5 per cent but when you start looking at places like newfoundland and saskatchewan saskatchewan has the highest proportional public sector in north america at 27 4 per cent
8336563 once the banks and credit institutions pull back their reins they keep them pulled back for a long time the more optimistic consumer economists dont understand this because this is very different compared to any other experience they have gone through it is impossible to calculate the impact of the breakdown of securitisation
8336564 the impact from global weakening so far on u s manufacturers remains modest
8336565 while simultaneously still having very modest weakness in manufacturing and capital spending
8336566 an increasingly strained consumer deepening woes for the housing sector and a desire to pare inventories will all weigh on manufacturing output
8336567 this spreading weakness abroad and it is worse now in europe and japan than it is in the u s a is the primary reason for the dollars recovery
8336568 world economic growth in 2009 is likely to be the slowest since 2003
8336569 every world regions growth is expected to slow next year and the list of countries in or near recession is expanding
8336570 if this is a symptom of potentially weaker exports going forward then were in another high risk period
8336571 oh moishe im so tired from looking after the house all the time you were away please another time if you dont mind
8336572 oy vay moishe such a terrible headache i have got i wont be able to do anything and it wouldnt be any good please wait a bit longer

8336574 its not about rehabilitation its about public safety w hat democrats have to do is understand that republicans have it right
8336575 im sure my butt is going to shrink but theres so much of it im not worried its going to go away
8336576 i want to dive into each theme and really become the character
8336577 she was delightful and what a great ass she has it was a real girls weekend in vegas
8336578 i am always star struck especially in the presence of an icon like cher who just happens to be very friendly and fun
8336579 i hope chers not insulted that she was a part of the trade
8336580 i think i made cher laugh a couple of times maybe someday shell come see me perform in las vegas at mandalay bay a girl can dream cant she
8336581 kelly taylor is now the counselor at the high school so jennie garth and i have some interesting stuff together
8336582 faced with growing ridership on the commuter trains the constant rise in demand our development projects and our dependency on petroleum we clearly had to renew our locomotives and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions
8336583 the amt cannot say for now how many cars or locomotives will be deployed per line
8336584 the east train a project unveiled in late 2006 serving the east and north east of the island will of course be a priority with five locomotives and 20 cars and the rest will be deployed according to the age of the material already rolling into place
8336585 were in a hurry for this electric transport we need it
8336586 a study will be launched later this fall in order to have a better idea of the implied costs

8336592 it gives me an opportunity to step up to the plate and prove myself
8336593 but we played chicagos devin hester last year and stopped him three times inside the 20 on kickoffs its something we can do
8336594 union negotiators worked late into the night to prepare our counter offer and will be delivering it to boeing today
8336595 what weve committed is that this is too important to play those kinds of games
8336596 over the course of the summer leaders at the countrys biggest law firms have come to an unpleasant realization theyre about to employ more lawyers than they need
8336597 a strange and rigid hiring process that has been entrenched for a long time
8336598 and technology will help us lawyers in l a can work on new york based projects and vice versa
8336599 its existed for decades and hardly anyone gives any critical thought to it
8336600 now when we look at our staffing we ask who is it that we need
8336601 if we need a restructuring lawyer well go out and hire one as a third year or as a lateral attorney
8336602 he has to keep smiling no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
8336603 while it may now be legal for a prosecutor to carry a licensed concealed handgun in a courtroom i retain significant concerns with regard to the level of training that should be required in order to permit prosecutors to safely carry firearms in the volatile environment of a criminal courthouse
8336604 who have demonstrated a high level of proficiency to a certified firearms instructor on my staff
8336605 the authority of an employer to restrict the carrying of licensed handguns on the premises under the employers control is expressly recognized
8336606 department stores like macys bloomingdales filenes lord amp taylor neiman marcus nordstrom and saks fifth avenue cheated consumers by making a pact that theyd only sell cosmetic products at the suggested retail price
8336607 i dont even think i am on the long list
8336608 if they are looking for a female i may dress in drag to fill that roll if that is what they feel like they need
8336609 would call in pat robertson to pray it off the coast
8336610 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8336611 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
8336612 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best
8336613 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice
8336614 throughout it all the challengers legal team consisted primarily of the three undersigned attorneys with occasional support from a small handful of others all working on a pro bono basis
8336615 who also personally bore all the expenses of the litigation
8336616 never saw this as anything other than a pro bono case
8336617 if this is not an exceptional case warranting an enhancement multiplier we are at a loss to describe what case would qualify

8336620 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8336621 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
8336622 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8336623 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8336624 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8336625 the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8336626 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality
8336627 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8336628 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8336629 real madrid that would be handy i think everyone at celtic would like to get real madrid
8336630 because scientific theories are true religious beliefs must be false
8336631 and like any militant church this one places a familiar demand before all others thou shalt have no other gods before me
8336632 that the russian government leadership now has chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
8336633 he fought the other dog to free the child blade is very protective

8336637 in england people dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they work so hard they only talk to people at lunch
8336638 then in the evening they watch tv so they can get up early for work the next day
8336639 in manchester the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8336640 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8336641 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club
8336642 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8336643 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8336644 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8336645 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8336646 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8336647 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8336648 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8336649 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8336650 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8336651 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8336652 we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so
8336653 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8336654 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8336655 ukraine is a buffer zone between europe and russia which has energy resources and could pull the plug on europe nato membership would be very provocative because of the russian fleet in sebastopol so maybe its better not to join at the moment
8336656 russia did what was necessary to protect its people if they hadnt protected the ossetians it would have been worse
8336657 we aim to enter the pan european system of security because we are convinced that today there is no other alternative way of protecting ukraines territorial integrity her sovereignty
8336658 i invited you guys a few weeks ago and at that time i thought i had a place with just high school buddies turns out one of my friends couldnt get enough bodies so he solicited some from his office the people in there answered
8336659 you want to get us arrested for offering booze to minors
8336660 remember what i told you about the lady next door
8336661 we have really good air conditioning free gin why not offer them candy maybe ask them to your see the inside of your van
8336662 anyway i had this buddy josh who was supposed to be staying here all the time he quit his job a few months before and said he was writing screenplays he was going to stay here all summer every day
8336663 not exactly josh didnt write shit he just got fucked up around the clock acting like a huge dick all the time the second weekend we have the place were just hanging out and then the people in the living room show up theyre a little different than i expected and its a little awkward but no huge problem i figured they needed some time to get their shit unpacked and get settled so me and another friend caleb head out for the night
8336664 so caleb and i wind up spending the night over at
8336665 im serious i guess while caleb and i were out josh got super loaded on this watermelon hed been soaking in rum and decided to order a hooker from atlantic city these people are just hanging out in the living room getting unpacked and a hooker shows up
8336666 she was a pro straight out of one of the casinos huge implants leather mini skirt the whole deal she even had some bouncer with her for protection this huge dude who looked like a fat mike tyson they walk into the house in front of everybody and josh goes in the back room with the chick and fucks her hes in there with her for like an hour and then she walks out arranges herself in the bathroom says goodbye to everyone and leaves
8336667 he sat in the kitchen the whole time freaking everyone out
8336668 anyway these people were seriously angry i guess somebodys girlfriend left insisted on getting a hotel room somewhere else for the night i thought they were going to ask for their rent money back the larry bird guy was seriously shouting at me
8336669 we had to throw him out hes staying with some other friends over near the bay
8336670 josh got all fucked up the next night and almost put the old lady in the hospital
8336671 this old hag next door who always complains about the noise she started screaming about the music being too loud josh went inside got the watermelon went out on the deck and chucked it at her
8336672 no shit thing missed her by a foot the thing exploded everywhere covering her in pits a rinds and pulp she started screaming and freaking out and called the police the landlord called and said if he saw josh in the house hed throw all of us out
8336673 right right sorry the larry bird guy was screaming at me and just as i think hes done and i can walk away he tells me we have to replace his lunch meat
8336674 i had to go out and buy him a pound of turkey at the wawa
8336675 i guess when the bouncer showed up he asked them if he could make a sandwich nobody said anything so he went into the refrigerator brought out all the cold cuts and made himself a hoagie
8336676 the whole idea of subs is that people make the sandwich for you you can make your own sandwich but you cant make your own hoagie
8336677 all i know is i had to go to the store and wait in line to get that guy a bottle of mustard and a pound of turkey you ever had to do something like that its fucking demeaning
8336678 you know it would be nice if you could close that window
8336679 i dont think so i think youre just saying that
8336680 not really i saw someone use that trick at work last week screws people up for a second they dont know what to say
8336681 he was passed out and hed have refused anyway there would have been a fight
8336682 he used a whole jar of mustard on one sub
8336683 this boycott effort will cost you millions of dollars of lost revenue and possibly tens of millions of dollars in lost value for both the manchester grand hyatt and the grand del mar
8336684 absolute last thing the grand needs right now is a boycott
8336685 theres another reason for working inside the system dostoevsky said that taking a new step is what people fear most any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive affirmative non challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future this acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution
8336686 labor union organizers turned out to be poor community organizers mass organization is a different animal it is not housebroken
8336687 and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since he talked about
8336688 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8336689 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position
8336690 allow men to be happy happiness is self contained and self sufficient happy men have no time and no use for you happy men are free men so kill their joy in living take away from them what they want make them think that the mere thought of a personal desire is evil bring them to a state where saying i want is no longer a natural right but a shameful admission
8336691 it was coming in steady as a rock wings perfectly level on either side
8336692 it was hard watching it because marty gave new meaning to the phrase conservative pilot
8336693 he would spend 45 minutes during pre flight inspecting stuff when most guys spend about 10 minutes
8336694 i kept my eye on the plane the whole time specifically because i knew it was marty
8336695 marty was a great guy a nice friendly warm guy
8336696 its been a while since i saw him its so sad
8336697 it was a shock all that black smoke i didnt know where it was coming from
8336698 our navy presence in the mediterranean will increase russian vessels will be visiting syria and other friendly ports more frequently
8336699 the two leaders gave their directions to advance ties in the economy trade and energy fields as well as military cooperation
8336700 it remains to be seen how much the russians would come through for syria damascus also does not want to jeopardize its ongoing peace talks with israel
8336701 i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
8336702 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8336703 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8336704 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8336705 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8336706 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8336707 the resilience of capital goods spending in face of tight credit conditions a poor growth outlook and declining business confidence continues to surprise
8336708 the oil sector in particular coupled with the steady recovery we have seen in the crude price over the past week seems to be attracting interest from investors again
8336709 aber grunds tzlich sind die interessen von astronomen nicht h her zu bewerten als die interessen von nachtmenschen
8336710 the script that weve written essentially covers all six if it was at the level of harry potter we might be able to talk about doing six films but in this case our film is very much an adaptation of the entire six
8336711 but of course we know there is a negative mass media campaign mounted against sudan and of course what the icc is doing will affect some of the investors who are interested seriously to come to invest in sudan
8336712 we will not deal with it or respond to it the icc
8336713 all its resolutions let them just soak them into water and drink them
8336714 this accord is the historic political economic fabric of our society nobody regardless of who he or she is should be allowed to destroy this treaty of peace
8336715 until now there are oil wells whose location is precarious to say the least
8336716 no peace loving sudanese would want to see any quarrel of the two partners over where the precise line is
8336717 the contract will be with a chinese company to build three dams two in equatoria and the third in bahr el ghazal

8336724 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8336725 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8336726 ive heard someone is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film i hope that happens but i hope it happens as a series of movies as one movie couldnt do it justice i really love that story and i dedicated a lot of my time to honor garths work but it wasnt meant to be
8336727 not earth shattering or particularly urgent though it enables a talented filmmaker to work through personal ideas about assimilation and family conflict in an open smart and gracious way
8336728 mainly concerned with generational and cultural issues very modest entry possesses equally modest commercial potential
8336729 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8336730 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
8336731 fox was just trying to get a pg 13 movie im ready to go to war against them but i cant because they dont give a s t
8336732 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral

8336734 i am so sorry he is adhd and has so much energy
8336735 they were selling clothes binoculars microwaves laptops weve never seen anything like it in abkhazia my neighbour bought a 500 250 fridge for 1 000 roubles 20
8336736 remember that while things might be cheap they were stolen from your brothers and sisters
8336737 i have been here non stop for several days and i would have seen them bringing over all these things
8336738 russian soldiers do not loot and those that do we hand them straight to the prosecutors office to face charges
8336739 one has to wonder if the russians would even know how to use it
8336740 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8336741 the decision will require us to make some extremely difficult decisions
8336742 unless life or limb is in immediate jeopardy or sexual abuse is about to occur
8336743 seek to involve the state courts who act as neutral magistrates in these complicated matters as early in the process as practicable
8336744 in that way the government may ensure that everyones interests are considered and the least amount of harm will come to the children the government seeks to protect as well as their parents
8336745 the whole reason we started the litigation was because we felt there were wrongs in the system
8336746 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8336747 im im im investing in something i believe in i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels

8336754 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8336755 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8336756 over 1 3 million acres have already burned this year in california
8336757 vegetation is extremely dry across the state and when you add these dry north winds to the mix the chance of a major fire igniting increases
8336758 the uneven and inequitable state of recovery of the gulf coast is a national embarrassment
8336759 although the force of the storms was an act of nature the failures of the recovery are an act of our government if we refuse to address this as a nation it will go down in history not only as a failure of leadership but also as a failure to hold our government accountable
8336760 it was the perfect storm of worker exploitation and wage suppression
8336761 we should have found ourselves in a situation where because of the dearth of employees workers could have found wages that equaled or exceeded those of workers in places like new york and new jersey but instead you had people brought in trafficked in through artificial government support
8336762 the transition to a new administration is a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger
8336763 not only can we help the gulf coast recover we can take the opportunity of the rebuilding effort to address the long standing root causes of poverty and vulnerability that existed in these two states long before the storms of 2005
8336764 this is our community we want it back the way it was or better
8336765 these areas will be open for public access this fall after we remove some deteriorating buildings old fences and other hazards
8336766 with these purchases there are now more than 17 500 acres of river frontage and oak woodlands available to the public
8336767 because poverty is closely linked to undesirable outcomes in areas such as health education emotional welfare and delinquency we take child poverty seriously as a measure of childrens well being
8336768 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
8336769 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
8336770 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
8336771 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
8336772 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
8336773 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
8336774 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
8336775 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
8336776 without subsidies most large scale fishing operations will be economically unviable
8336777 small scale fishers will have a better chance of thriving in local markets and global fish stocks will have an opportunity to rebound
8336778 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8336779 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8336780 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8336781 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8336782 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8336783 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8336784 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8336785 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8336786 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8336787 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8336788 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8336789 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8336790 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8336791 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8336792 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight
8336793 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8336794 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8336795 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8336796 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8336797 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8336798 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8336799 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8336800 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8336801 and investors have the right to know all the associated risks
8336802 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto it is confusion defile not ye yourselves in any of these things for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you and the land is defiled therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants
8336803 behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem
8336804 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months
8336805 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
8336806 we were also told not to worry too much about scattered jewish properties in arab neighborhoods or yeshivas jewish seminaries in the old city

8336818 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8336819 those catholics who take a public stance in opposition to the most fundamental moral teaching of the church place themselves outside full communion with the church and they should not present themselves for the reception of holy communion
8336820 threads like this are not going to make us work any harder
8336821 oh come on guise 1 01 was released a month ago
8336822 a few hours before the soldiers departed on their mission on august 18 the interpreter who was supposed to accompany the small patrol disappeared
8336823 through the missing interpreter or through afghan police or soldiers
8336824 the french army spokesman in kabul denied that the afghan interpreter in question had fled saying that he had been killed during the clashes and that his body had been returned to his family
8336825 through the missing interpreter or through afghan police or soldiers
8336826 as i have pointed out many many times there is no reliable way to distinguish a peaceful muslim from an actual or potential jihadist there is no islamic group anywhere in the world that has pronounced takfir upon muslims who hold to the idea that non muslims must be warred against and subjugated that is no islamic group has declared such ideas to be un islamic consequently the french patrol was foolish to entrust itself to this afghan interpreter whose loyalties they could not know
8336827 the british can stay here until they get rid of the taliban but we cannot make them our friends because they are not muslims

8336838 how could the reader of such an article know who wrote what
8336839 it is only fair to duly acknowledge authors who invest time and knowledge in their contributions
8336840 this release is an important proof of principle but our ambitious aim with the mememoir project is to revolutionize publishing in all of science
8336841 with a knowledge base that is open access interdisciplinary and combines the altruistic possibilities of wikis with explicit authorship

8336844 i will be glad whenever mcgee is officially gone his i will only call 4 different plays mentality can suck up in michigan right now for all i care
8336845 everybody knew exactly what we were going to do that was like the arrogance of being at michigan our players are better than yours thats how it was that kind of got to players when it stopped working the big games like ohio state we would want to show them something we didnt do during the season but wed go out there and do the same thing
8336846 i even turned in a gripping performance in motherfucking reign over me
8336847 you must be willing to sacrifice some of your pawns to win the game
8336848 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8336849 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8336850 you can hear the enthusiasm when they tell you yeah im coming
8336851 it makes perfect sense when you think about who we are
8336852 we cant really sit here and be comfortable with hosting one event a year

8336883 speaking as a defensive player i was not happy with us we have got to make sure we do not play too open
8336884 we still have quite a bit to do and we have to build from the back forward
8336885 i was involved with the squad for three years and i certainly wanted to go
8336886 i was disappointed and i have moved on and im focused on the a league and i think were going to give it a real good shake this year
8336887 i think we play pretty good football and we play for the crowd
8336888 weve got a good squad and built it from last year
8336889 we were disappointed not to make the finals especially with our run towards the end because if we had made the finals we probably would have won it

8336903 to advance a right wing agenda on every front every uterus must be examined every tree chopped down every oil well dug i mean its absolute madness
8336904 i mean the only group of people that i know who werent weeping for the next several weeks after 9 11 were the people who were busy typing legislation into their computers
8336905 e verybody in the world knows that americans are geographically challenged and historically challenged
8336906 and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable and there are other acts of terror that have gone on in places like bosnia that we forgot to notice
8336907 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
8336908 youre talking about roughly 45 billion of reserves insuring 4 5 trillion of deposits
8336909 and youre in an environment right now where non current loans delinquent loans are increasing at a faster pace than banks putting aside reserves thats not a good thing

8336942 a pinch hit walk off hit would be absolutely amazing but in the cage they dont throw curveballs at you it was a good pitch against my approach which was to swing at anything and everything that was around the plate and i did that
8336943 i now understand what its like to be a pinch hitter youre prepared for it but you cant be ready for the actual situation until youre actually in it i was a little kid in a big league game i should have been in the little league world series instead of this one

8336964 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms

8336966 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8336968 i think gustav is overshadowing the eia report it doesn t appear to having an impact
8336969 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8336970 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8336971 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8336972 at least 70 per cent of canada s gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8336973 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight

8337003 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8337004 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8337005 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8337006 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8337019 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business

8337035 as a practical matter how do you draw the line
8337036 i think this is really where you pull the cover off and see what youre really looking at with the aclu
8337037 this is religious bigotry its anti free speech its everything that theyre supposed to be against
8337038 the government really has no business telling anybody how they should or should not pray
8337039 and the fact that the aclu is trying to use the power of government to tell people how to pray is just an incredible invasion of freedom and it shows that they are not about freedom and liberty at all theyre about oppression and trying to stamp out religious speech

8337073 the government should explain why money voted in by parliament for healthcare is not being used to make sure patients get the access to treatment that they need
8337074 massive profits are being racked up in various trusts yet many areas of patient care are being starved of cash public health alcohol treatment services and mental health are simply not getting the money they need
8337075 what the government wont admit is that a surplus on the balance sheet is often achieved by making cuts to patient care
8337076 this is an excellent start to the year for the nhs a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients
8337077 the nhs is well on the way to delivering 18 weeks from referral to treatment and the progress on the mrsa target is a tremendous achievement that highlights how everyone working in the nhs has taken responsibility for making our hospitals cleaner and safer

8337091 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
8337092 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
8337093 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
8337094 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
8337095 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
8337096 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8337097 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
8337098 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
8337099 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
8337100 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there

8337152 la muerte en accidente de aviaci n de 154 personas s lo puede ser calificada de tragedia de la que se debe informar con prontitud rigor y minuciosidad esa es la obligaci n period stica pero cuando las televisiones decidieron dedicarle horas y horas al suceso la noticia se convirti en uno de esos eventos especiales tan apreciados que se retransmiten como un gran espect culo en este caso el espect culo del dolor puedo llegar a entender que las televisiones conviertan la vida en un espect culo pero por favor que no lo hagan con la muerte resulta demasiado obsceno

8337173 it is for freedom that christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery
8337174 sparked a lot of debate about this issue especially with regard to homosexuality are we truly slaves to our genetics what about the alcoholism gene what about the genetic predisposition to find children sexually attractive should we throw up our hands and give in to our genes
8337175 but thanks be to god that though you used to be slaves to sin you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness

8337260 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8337261 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8337262 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8337263 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8337264 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8337265 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8337266 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8337267 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8337268 we broadly welcome plans for a national database however we have concerns about womens personal information being kept secure
8337269 we would like some reassurance from the police that their privacy will be respected
8337270 worryingly in many areas front line officers could not easily access information on the databases particularly outside office hours when the majority of domestic abuse incidents occur
8337271 the risk to victims that this situation poses is widespread and largely unmitigated we therefore strongly recommend that a national database in conjunction with national data standards be developed and adopted by all forces as a matter of priority
8337272 we have been to crime scenes and the woman has no idea about the background of her partner
8337273 we have dealt with domestic violence as a local issue and theyre looking now at ensuring our systems are as seamless as possible these people are under the radar its not appropriate in the 21st century that they can move a few miles away and the police are not aware of their background
8337274 we want a consistency of approach that allows that access to information across scotland
8337275 this is not just the offenders but the victims who are also to be on the database this is an intelligence database but it would also inform the risk assessment process

8337285 oh i can imagine how long it is wait does he even have one anymore or did the crack eat it off thats ok ill suck on the stump
8337286 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8337287 it gives me an opportunity to step up to the plate and prove myself
8337288 in the approach of an attack of croup which almost always takes place in the evening probably of a day during which the child has been exposed to the weather and often after catarrhal symptoms have existed for several days he may be observed to be excited in variable spirits more ready than usual to laugh than to cry a little flushed occasionally coughing the sound of the cough being rough like that which attends the catarrhal stage of the measles more generally however the patient has been for some time in bed and asleep before the nature of the disease with which he is threatened is apparent then perhaps without waking he gives a very unusual cough well known to any one who has witnessed an attack of the croup it rings as if the child had coughed through a brazen trumpet it is truly a tussis clangosa it penetrates the walls and floor of the apartment and startles the experienced mother oh i am afraid our child is taking the croup she runs to the nursery finds her child sleeping softly and hopes she may be mistaken but remaining to tend him before long the ringing cough a single cough is repeated again and again the patient is roused and then a new symptom is remarked the sound of his voice is changed puling and as if the throat were swelled it corresponds with the cough
8337289 we should not let others do our thinking for us
8337290 all of the worst presidents in history were war veterans
8337291 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure were its heading
8337292 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8337293 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8337294 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8337295 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8337296 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8337297 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8337298 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral
8337299 primarily reflects melt in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8337300 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances
8337301 the arctic is gigantic when you have nine bears sighted in one transect route one can assume that there are likely a lot more bears swimming in open water
8337302 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault
8337303 we support their democracy and we will work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8337304 invasion of a sovereign and democratic neighbor and its recognition of the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8337305 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8337306 our navy presence in the mediterranean will increase russian vessels will be visiting syria and other friendly ports more frequently
8337307 the two leaders gave their directions to advance ties in the economy trade and energy fields as well as military cooperation
8337308 it remains to be seen how much the russians would come through for syria damascus also does not want to jeopardize its ongoing peace talks with israel
8337309 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flames history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance

8337327 its a moment of national solidarity the opposition has called a moratorium on open differences with the government because the country is occupied
8337328 i think there will be a few months before people think about making political trouble for the government
8337329 the last thing i wanted to have here is being vindicated in this way but the point here is at least its high time to open your eyes and see what we are dealing with
8337330 i believe our people is consolidated as never before on that point russia has grossly miscalculated the point here is its not about me any more the nation has got more mature democracy will become more vibrant and the long term effect will be exactly the opposite to what they intended
8337331 people are now outraged with russia it greatly strengthens saakashvilis position internationally no question but domestically as well
8337332 his political situation has been shored up inadvertently perhaps by this russian move
8337333 i hope the international community will not limit itself only to statements but will shift to real action soon
8337334 but the time will come when the georgian society will start to ask them questions about what has happened to our country
8337335 in informal settlements sex work is rife and combined with rampant alcoholism mine workers run the gauntlet of stds and hiv aids
8337336 usually they needed more than one to survive so sex work went up a lot
8337337 a political issue that doesnt bear any relevance in relation to hiv and aids
8337338 we tried to respond because its not only the women at risk but also their clients our employees
8337339 but the intention of the programme wasnt to eliminate sex work which is a huge undertaking because of poverty and unemployment
8337340 hiv positive contract workers do not appear on the statistical records of the mine and they do not present a burden on the medical expenses of the corporation
8337341 it all depends on whether they the company owning the mine are a good employer who looks after their employees or whether they only like them when theyre fit and can work
8337342 the government is also limited and over stretched so it tries to shed some responsibility onto the private sector
8337343 the constraints are that the mines are focused on their core business from day to day theyre not qualified to do hiv aids work
8337344 in terms of hiv theres a bit of competition between the different mines
8337345 its a marketing exercise i dont like it at all its all about meaningful partnerships and whatever muscle we have as the corporate world we should come together
8337346 the closure comes following a further deterioration of the situation in the area where the clinic is located
8337347 there has been a notable increase in violence including mortars landing close to the clinic
8337348 until now the worlds response to the catastrophe has been massively inadequate
8337349 the thing he always stresses is excellence thats how he coaches the game he gets excited he coaches the game like i would want to play the game hes just so intense at all times and hes so focused on the task at hand
8337350 anytime youre talking to somebody you want to make eye contact and hes going to do that
8337351 the players respect him for that and hes consistent hes a great motivator if youre going to coach defense youd better have some intensity its about contact its about running to the ball its about playing with emotion its about playing with energy body language is very important so defensive coaches have got to be that way
8337352 anybody with any sense would give god most of the credit for those guys going to the nfl because theyve got ability
8337353 but the world is full of under achievers too every town has a michael jordan that nobodys ever heard of because the guy didnt have the intangible qualities
8337354 youve got to have some physical ability but it comes down to what i call the two hs you want a guy whos going to play with his head meaning playing intelligently he plays with his eyes prior to the ball being snapped and playing with your heart once its snapped
8337355 if he goes out there looking for five different pitches hes not going to be very good

8337358 wouldnt it be great if there was a single foster care program that spanned across counties
8337359 by working together well better serve the communitys abused and neglected children and support those foster parents who open their hearts and their homes to take care of them
8337360 were excited to take the best from each countys program and combine them in a way that assures foster parents receive the training support and resources they need to provide a good home that supports each childs needs safety and family connections
8337361 the idea for this collaboration came from the employees in both counties who work day in and day out with these families
8337362 both counties are committed to assuring that when a child needs protection is unable to remain at home and is placed into foster care that the quality of care is excellent that their temporary home is stable and secure and their childhood is truly honored

8337376 nature never intended the infants stomach to be converted into a receptacle for laxatives carminatives antacids stimulants and astringents and when these become necessary we may rest assured that there is something faulty in our management however perfect it may seem to ourselves
8337377 to feed an infant with animal food before it has teeth proper for masticating it shows a total disregard to the plain indications of nature in withholding such teeth till the system requires their assistance to masticate solid food and the method of grating and pounding meat as a substitute for chewing may be well suited to the toothless octogenarian whose stomach is capable of digesting it but the stomach of a young child is not adapted to the digestion of such food and will be disordered by it it cannot reasonably be maintained that a childs mouth without teeth and that of an adult furnished with the teeth of carnivorous and graminivorous animals are designed by the creator for the same sort of food if the mastication of solid food whether animal or vegetable and a due admixture of saliva be necessary for digestion then solid food cannot be proper when there is no power of mastication if it is swallowed in large masses it cannot be masticated at all and will have but a small chance of being digested and in an undigested state it will prove injurious to the stomach and to the other organs concerned in digestion by forming unnatural compounds the practice of giving solid food to a toothless child is not less absurd than to expect corn to be ground where there is no apparatus for grinding it that which would be considered as an evidence of idiotism or insanity in the last instance is defended and practised in the former if on the other hand to obviate this evil the solid matter whether animal or vegetable be previously broken into small masses the infant will instantly swallow it but it will be unmixed with saliva yet in every days observation it will be seen that children are so fed in their most tender age and it is not wonderful that present evils are by this means produced and the foundation laid for future disease

8337415 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8337416 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8337417 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8337418 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8337419 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8337581 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet
8337582 the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8337583 if it doesnt happen it wont be for want of trying
8337584 hes a player that i know obviously i worked with him at blackburn and wales so i know what he could offer us
8337585 but i think west ham came out yesterday quite strongly in their response to any interest that anybody has shown
8337586 i felt a little bit nervous at the start which is only natural i suppose but thats a great start to the season for me
8337587 andrews a great player so it was nice just to get over the line
8337588 id also like to stay in the top four and get closer the number one spot you have to set your goals even higher now that youre in the top four
8337589 ive not really put my cue down over the summer i had a week in egypt with my girlfriend but i played a tournament in china and have also been involved with john higgins world series of snooker so ive been busy ive not really had time to rest

8337593 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
8337594 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment
8337595 before the match i really believed i had a chance to win
8337596 i knew if i could hang in there and just get stuck in then id be in with a chance i came away with the win so im pretty pleased with that
8337597 schiavone is ranked a lot higher than me and shes a seeded player and i wanted to go out there and just give it my best shot
8337598 in the first set she may have been a bit scrappy but i felt i did a really good job there
8337599 even when i went 4 2 down when i lost my serve there i never felt at that point that i would lose the match
8337600 i felt that if i just kept fighting and hanging in there then my chance would come and yes i got there
8337601 for me its been a long year and there have been a few ups and downs but im finally well im not where i want to be because i just want to keep climbing up in the rankings
8337602 but this year you know it was quite significant for me to finally break into the top 100
8337603 like i said before it had been a goal of mine for so long and now im just looking ahead and you know working on the next goal
8337604 i definitely came away from that match with venus with a lot more confidence and just being out there on the big stage against someone like her and not feeling too fazed about it
8337605 todays match here was totally different though and right now im just pleased to have got through that
8337606 not many people can say they have a gold medal
8337607 shes someone ive never played against before ive practised with her in the past and it will definitely be another tough match for me
8337608 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8337609 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8337610 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8337611 he gives up his chance to win us 10million 5 6million and the possibility of playing for huge world ranking points
8337612 having said that justin rose has been over there cementing his place in the team hes given up his chance of winning us 10million saying its only money you cant take it with you

8337624 im a high school teacher i enjoy younger people im not part of their group age wise but emotionally im about 12
8337625 hes the oldest guy out there and unfortunately that works against people all the time even though theres probably nobody better equipped for this game hes probably the guy who will be the biggest asset if they dont get foolish and vote him out
8337626 i will win survivor because im the bombshell baller im bodacious and i outwit and outlast and outplay and i need a million dollars really bad
8337627 michelle is a wild card for me because i actually thought that michelle had a good solid energy coming into the game but shes very small and very young i think her life experience is the big question mark what will she do when the going gets tough
8337628 in addition to trying to be charismatic and active in the challenges i have a little additional problem which is that from societys viewpoint i have been very successful already
8337629 marcus is a physician as he likes to remind people and he is a true leader an extremely bright guy hes a hero he is a huge threat to win the game for sure he has looks hes got smarts hes probably the fittest guy out there so hes got a lot of things going for him
8337630 the first player that i see going off thinking theyre gonna track an elephant or a hippo im gonna kick their ass because we dont need them coming into our camp
8337631 susie is a mom and she likes to talk thats definitely her biggest obstacle to overcome that she cant shut up if i went in and played this game and got teamed up with susie i would be wary of her hanging in there with me because she seems to go with the wind and doesnt even seem like shes paying attention at times
8337632 my achilles heel in this game will most likely be trust you have to have trust to win this game but you have to know who is untrustworthy and thats probably the most difficult task
8337633 hes earnest but he is his own worst enemy he means well and does not know when to shut up hes like a cocker spaniel charming and annoying at the same time
8337634 its kind of one of my natural instincts to flirt i dont mean to thats actually going to be something i watch because i dont want a target to be on my back from the other girls
8337635 i think jacque will be a bit of a dark horse i dont think shell be a leader i think shell use her looks and her charm to get in with the right guy and hope that she can ride with that guy as far as she can if jacque gets deep into the show i think shes a legitimate threat at the challenges shes pretty fit
8337636 im a fierce competitor i dont want to lose i was raised in the mountains and also in the city so i got the wilderness down and i got the humanity down
8337637 i think matty will be one of the favorites this season someone people will absolutely love i find him to be one of the most endearing guys weve ever had on the show to the point where it could work against him because he cant hide anything if hes confused he says im confused if hes happy hes smiling if hes sad hes crying
8337638 i love doing all sorts of crazy things it doesnt matter what age you are as long as you can physically do it do it and hopefully theyll look at me as a mom and you know who would like to kick their mother out of the game
8337639 charm is her strength because shes likable in doses and thats her liability
8337640 i will win survivor because i need this million dollars more than anyone out here
8337641 g c is a fish out of water does he have the fortitude to really do this because when i talked to him before the show it seemed like a lot of nervous energy masquerading as confidence but it was really i felt fear like what am i getting into and thats not a good place to be because what youre getting into is a big ol headache
8337642 i think i deserve it ive worked really hard in my life im very competitive im stubborn im compassionate and passionate
8337643 paloma is sassy cute my question for her is is her attitude real or is it a put on and if it is a put on how long will she be able to sustain it when she starts getting hungry palomas going to have to pick the right alliance who you decide to team up with early on has such an impact on how you do in the game because if you pick the wrong people it can be hard to get out from under that
8337644 i havent really noticed any crazy people which kind of makes me nervous that either im the crazy person or there are no crazy people
8337645 charlie prides himself on being very bright and educated and the question id say for charlie is can he stand up for himself does he really have a voice or is he just going to look for somebody to hang on to and see how far theyll pull him along
8337646 i will win survivor because i have the three bs brains beauty and blazing speed
8337647 i think crystals big dilemma is going to be what does she say that she does who does she say she is because its obvious shes an athlete crystal has a mouth on her she does not edit that makes her great at tribal council but a liability in the game
8337648 ill step on toes if i have to these people were not friends of mine last week and time will tell if theyll be friends of mine two months from now but a million dollars is more important than their friendship except maybe with that one blonde with the big t that might be worth a few hundred grand
8337649 randy is crotchety and clever hes the guy who will come to tribal council and try to challenge me which is a huge mistake because im not playing for a million dollars but i dont think hes as evil as he wants you to think he is
8337650 im funny and im fun and im energetic and i bring a positive vibe to the group like a burst of sunshine
8337651 the way i would describe kelly is that she is part of the text message generation
8337652 gaming will help me because i do well under pressure i always come through i rarely choke im the underdog i think all the fans will root for me to win i would root for myself if i was watching tv
8337653 ken the gamer is one of my favorite people who has been on the show in a long time he is convinced his gaming expertise is absolutely in line with what it takes to win that he knows this game backward and forward simply because hes a gamer but ken is a true nerd i think when the show began he weighed less than chinas courtney did
8337654 honestly like im a girl weve all starved ourselves here and there i can starve for a little while i think there are no losers in survivor we all come home skinny detoxed and tan were all winners
8337655 corinne is a self proclaimed ber bitch and she owns it i think the meanest thing you could say to corinne would be to say youre very pleasant she would take that as an insult of the highest order
8337656 i watch the game i know how to play the game ive done sales my whole life im good with people and im physically adept and im a manipulative bastard
8337657 you would expect him to be like a villain in a bond movie who dies a horrible death at the end its almost like a blind arrogance and hes really fun to watch and i think his accent could work for him or against him but there is something about the accent that makes everything he says seem smarter
8337658 i want to make everyone fall in love with me and i want to be friends with everybody thats all i got my personality im not strong

8337667 i agree with you that lieberman would have some draw with moderates and independents but i think for every vote he wins there he stands to lose mccain about the same number from his own base
8337668 caruso yeah i admit im kind of in favor of the romney pick because i think it would be such a bad choice
8337669 wed like to congratulate senator mccain on choosing senator lieberman as his running mate as you know ive worked with joe lieberman in the senate for nearly 20 years and i think the man is an inspired choice almost as inspired now as he was when he ran for our partys presidential nomination four years ago or when he was our vice presidential candidate eight years ago its hard to find anything to criticize about joe lieberman really because we agree on so many issues from being for a womans right to choose to being in favor of hand gun control so again we want to congratulate senator mccain for finally seeing the light on so many of these contentious issues and we look forward to a long productive discussion as the campaign continues about why barack obama joe lieberman and i like the majority of americans can all manage to agree on these things while senator mccain remains outside the mainstream
8337670 oh that joe he was pretty funny when he was on our side of the aisle too
8337671 damn i dont know which one to vote fer the ticket with the catholic and the black guy or the one with the jew and the rich feller on his second marriage

8337680 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8337681 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8337682 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8337684 the young cartoonist dash shaw comes down firmly on the symbolic end of the comics continuum
8337685 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8337686 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

8337712 there were no conferences because there were no flights and then people didnt want to travel because of fear

8337715 gave me a unique selling point and differentiated me from other people enabling people whod booked in the past to give me a second look
8337716 but the second that word of the strike was murmured its like the entire electricity of the town was shut off the rug was pulled out from underneath us

8337765 zero day threat the shocking truth of how banks and credit bureaus help cyber crooks steal your money and identity is an interesting and eye opening look at how banks and credit card companies make id theft and fraud rather elementary but with all that this book must be read in the larger context of how todays society deals with and is often oblivious to risk when is comes to risk american society tolerates tens of thousands of drunk driving deaths gives millions in federal tobacco subsidies and is oblivious about near epidemics such as heart disease obesity and diabetes with all that it is doubtful that the myriad horror stories zero day threat details will persuade congress or the other players to do anything to curtail the problem with identity theft and internet fraud

8337778 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
8337779 weve got the lowest taxes and highest level of services in north texas
8337780 thats one of the things that is a prime motivation right now in getting support in congress
8337781 if a state like california says this is real were willing to put our money against it it will help focus attention on this
8337782 its probably not going to catch on in most places because of the cost and because the benefits just arent worth the cost
8337783 while the high speed trains look nice theyre just polished up old sterile technology
8337784 theyre like i am i am an old man with a new haircut
8337785 i would be fairly confident the number of uninsured will go up in 2008
8337786 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8337787 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8337788 after it gets into the gulf it has the potential to go anywhere
8337789 if this storm continues to come this way ill be changing my travel plans
8337790 in 2007 there was a lot of activity with states taking the lead in moving toward health reform
8337791 in good times states expand programs and in bad economic times they scale them back
8337792 in my view to withdraw in this manner showed disrespect to this court more critically it showed gross disrespect to mr knights family
8337793 such insensitive conduct does not in my opinion have any place in this jurisdiction
8337794 i can say with some feeling that there was certainly no discourtesy intended to the court or to the knight family
8337795 we are sorry if our actions have inadvertently caused offence
8337796 but im on a diet so i drink it real slow so the calorie settles on the bottom
8337797 we will clean your house for less than you can imagine
8337798 consistently opposed the asbestos bill because it was unfair he thought it was dead wrong that if the trust fund ran out of money for the victims they couldnt even get their rights back
8337799 no sen biden was a well known opponent of the asbestos bill and beau biden was a prominent attorney who was working on behalf of mesothelioma victims
8337800 for 35 years sen biden has had one and only one position on these issues he believes that victims have rights to hold accountable those who injure them
8337801 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone
8337802 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8337803 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8337804 after four or five days it becomes a physical endurance test
8337805 can you stay up past 1 oclock in the morning can you go to one more party
8337806 the more donors chip in the more access they buy
8337807 and these are some of the biggest lobbying corporations on capitol hill
8337808 many of our top fundraisers in attendance can attend a range of different events thanking them for the work they have been and are doing to help change washington
8337809 this is a way for us to show our appreciation
8337810 you want to be nice to them make sure they have nice hotels and good transportation and good seats
8337811 the party also can provide access to important decision makers thats what pleases contributors
8337812 i would urge the school to review the decision in consultation with their parent community
8337813 i think the decision by the principal in townsville the other day was prompted by the fact that increasingly we as a community are wrapping our children in cotton wool
8337814 i think our generation of parents are mollycoddling their children
8337815 the charges submitted are sufficient to warrant a hearing on the merits and a stay of the proceedings is inappropriate
8337816 conceal from or fail to disclose to the council information material to its review and approval of the settlements
8337817 the requisite taint identified by the court for purposes of official misconduct is established when a public officer engages in activities in his official capacity for personal gain and conceals information about those activities
8337818 the protections afforded an accused officer do not include the right to suspend a removal proceeding while criminal charges are pending even when those charges are based on the same facts and circumstances
8337819 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8337820 i believe its eminently fair balanced and ultimately likely to result in justice
8337821 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8337822 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8337823 theres a lot of animus there because it was so close
8337824 whether its a career in the u s senate to be the equivalent of a ted kennedy a sort of ber senator or whether its to maintain her viability so if obama loses she doesnt even have to say i told you so and shes the front runner for next time
8337825 but those things only happen if shes seen as doing the right thing now
8337826 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8337827 were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8337828 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8337829 its not the way i drew it up when i came to the park today
8337830 it was the biggest pitch in the game he was in a position where one pitch could turn the whole game around if alex gets a hit there they have their lefty hitters coming up and they get the ball rolling
8337831 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
8337832 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8337833 did ronald reagan seem less down to earth because he was inspiring in his speeches was john kennedy less down to earth because he asked us to put our country ahead of ourselves
8337834 there arent a lot of people in public life who do this personally
8337835 when you live in the world of words specific words are important
8337836 the impact of his words is so strong because they are so personal
8337837 one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes
8337838 in no other country on earth is my story even possible
8337839 he doesnt make jokes theres no sense of bounce there
8337840 embodies what americans would like to believe is best about their country his message is not a scolding message its a hopeful message he reeks hope
8337841 he is very good at analyzing a situation and making a concise and accessible argument
8337842 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
8337843 you can trust our guy because hes not eloquent enough to mislead you
8337844 his ability to inspire people through his speeches has put a much sharper focus on mccains inability to do that
8337845 he didnt want to be in a convention hall with just the elected delegates he wants to speak to the country
8337846 will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8337847 could possibly make him unelectable in a general election but he felt very strongly
8337848 write on scraps of paper in the mens room of the state capitol
8337849 a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too the audacity of hope
8337850 and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just wont do in this election
8337851 hasnt made me the most conventional candidate but it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts
8337852 when you have a choice between doing something stupid and doing nothing it is better to do nothing

8337872 if the tickets were still in my name id tear them up if they couldn t afford to finance that stadium on their own they shouldn t be leaving giants stadium

8338025 we are having a terrible problem with it we are going to change chemicals next year or we will be overwhelmed by it

8338027 we have not abandoned any farms yet like they have in georgia
8338028 it is an aggressive weed that can produce millions of seeds per plant
8338029 for a weed it has all the benefits it is fast growing a high reproductive rate and is very aggressive it has found a perfect niche in our fields
8338030 basically the herbicide is the key and the lock is the part it acts on
8338031 when a weed becomes resistant the lock changes and the key does not work any more weeds are highly adaptive plants
8338032 but in the near future if we are not careful we will see fields that are heavily infested
8338033 we will depend on herbicide activity to keep the weeds down
8338034 i know people dont want to hear that but it is an option to use with soil applied herbicides

8338079 hoped its first ever national league would pave the way
8338080 the pdca has just staged the first eight team national league which rawalpindi won by beating multan by two wickets in the final in the southern port city of karachi on sunday night
8338081 we think its a huge leap for us and the first ever league would help us form a strong pakistan disabled team and make our dreams of touring india next year come true
8338082 to make all physically impaired people realize that they can live a life without any worries
8338083 they come on crutches but leave their support to show they can play and
8338084 the determination to overcome their physical impediments is a common theme amongst the teammates and they play an important role in a country where health facilities and opportunities for disabled people are rudimentary at best
8338085 i am amazed at their courage and passion i was behind forming the peshawar team and when we announced trials we thought some 10 to 20 players would come but there were over 100 players in the trials
8338086 it is eye catching to see a player with just one hand hitting sixes and that was on display during the league i think icc must support this type of cricket and give encouragement by arranging series for them

8338092 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8338093 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8338094 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8338095 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8338096 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8338097 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8338098 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8338099 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8338100 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8338101 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8338102 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job
8338103 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
8338104 are you ready for victory then you must be ready for unity that is the only way we are going to win and have this victory
8338105 im going to cast my vote for senator obama if hillary clinton says shes going to cast her vote for senator obama

8338109 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8338110 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8338111 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8338112 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8338113 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8338114 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8338115 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8338116 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8338117 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8338118 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8338119 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8338120 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8338121 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8338122 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8338150 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8338151 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8338152 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8338153 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8338154 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8338155 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8338156 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8338189 a stated overarching purpose for the said proposal to place a marine monument in cnmi waters is to urgently help create a blue legacy or president bush prior to his lame duck departure from office in january 2009 another purpose heralded for the venture is to reap credence and credibility to the ocean legacy project of the pew charitable trusts
8338190 the non partisan unified opposition of the cnmi populace to the monument proposal is clear through oral statements in the cnmis two native languages of carolinian and chamorro and through written statements in english cnmi elected leaders have said eghe ahi and no way jorge respectively what is there about no in three different languages that monument proponents do not understand and refuse to respect
8338191 the common denominator shared by the cnmi and these opposition groups is the reality that the designation process is a unilateral arbitrary presidential action that eschews weighing stakeholder concerns in a fair manner furthermore designation is a permanent action that is unlikely to be reversed by a subsequent u s congress even if the monument is later discovered to be ill designed and non functional and worse yet the imminent designation of the said monument merely hinges on an artificial and unrealistic political heritage deadline of january 2009 not on ecological and marine conservation concerns

8338255 in world war ii there was the element of surprise which materially assisted in degrading the quality of the aaa this was not the case in north vietnam there was no element of surprise because of the small geographical area involved limited approach routes and the few targets available for attack as a consequence of the geography strike forces had to meet the defenses almost head on that is there was limited opportunity to strike from multiple directions and to feint the enemy defenses out of position it was necessary to designate specific elements of the strike force to counter aaa fire in the target area for fighter operations this isnt a unique technique it was used in world war ii and korea
8338256 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8338257 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8338258 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8338259 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives

8338261 there is a moment in the rare career wherein one is vaulted from a heralded obscure talent to a permanent placement in historys vernacular spencer days career is morphing to the latter the current tour is not simply about playing high profile venues around the world nor simply about the release of a long awaited highly acclaimed album but the synergy of forces that are coming together to transform spencer day into the widely acclaimed artist critics know he will become

8338285 la pol tica hacia la inmigraci n debe dirigirse hacia la poblaci n inmigrante con necesidades de atenci n espec ficas y por ello se debe concretar en aquellos ciudadanos cuyos pa ses de origen dadas sus condiciones de vida les obliga a emigrar y no generalizar e incluir como inmigrantes a todo ciudadano no nacido en espa a pues es de sentido com n que no es la misma atenci n la que se debe prestar a un ciudadano de origen africano con dificultades de integraci n laboral que a un ciudadano brit nico que viene de profesor a una universidad valenciana
8338286 meter en el mismo saco de las cuentas p blicas a todos los extranjeros lleva a sumar las ayudas que recibe este profesor para escolarizar a sus hijos o la atenci n sanitaria que recibe un jubilado dan s que vive en calpe como parte de la pol tica de inmigraci n
8338287 la realidad de las cosas es que de los 692
8338288 si blasco quiere hacer extrapolaciones sobre crecimiento y situar la inmigraci n en 838 000 personas que lo haga pero l sabe que est mintiendo sobre los datos base ya que de la misma forma que incrementa linealmente un 14 por ciento la poblaci n extranjera debe descontar los efectos de paro de nuevos residentes que est teniendo la crisis econ mica
8338289 seguramente blasco suma tambi n al magante de la f rmula 1 bernie ecclestone como inmigrante y no sabemos si tambi n suma las ayudas a la formula 1 como parte de su pol tica de atenci n a la inmigraci n
8338290 seg n el conseller porcentualmente la comunitat valenciana est un 5 4 por ciento por encima de las tasas espa olas de inmigraci n pero lo que oculta es que esa tasa se sit a en esas cifras porque la poblaci n del reino unido es 33 puntos m s alta en la comunitat que en resto de espa a los alemanes 19 puntos superior a la media el conjunto de la uni n europea de los 27 es 8 2 puntos superior y el n mero de norteamericanos y canadieses est 11 2 puntos porcentuales por encima de la media estatal
8338291 la presencia de marroqu es es s lo 0 1 puntos superior a la media y la presencia de ciudadanos del conjunto de pa ses de am rica latina est 16 puntos por debajo de la conjunto de espa a
8338292 el discurso del consell en materia de inmigraci n destila un preocupante tufo segregacionista al insistir en lo que se gasta en educaci n sanidad o atenci n social a la poblaci n inmigrante o nativa
8338293 si en las fichas de escolarizaci n o en las tarjetas sanitarias pone anotaciones cuando escolariza a una ni a negra o atiende a un ciudadano con ojos rasgados para despu s sumar todos los puntos para hacer porcentajes
8338294 deben estar esas cuentas las habitaciones de la residencia de inmigrantes que han estado ocupadas por visitantes a la f rmula 1
8338295 m s all de las c balas que haga el conseller de inmigraci n sobre la encuesta la pol tica de inmigraci n de la generalitat es pura propaganda orientada a generar un estado de opini n que le permita al consell mantener el enfrentamiento con el gobierno en esta materia para seguir con sus reivindicaciones de financiaci n y a la vez mantener a la poblaci n con una sensaci n de preocupaci n ante cifras de inmigraci n que son falsas ya que blasco sabe muy bien que cuando l habla de inmigrantes la gran mayor a de ciudadanos asocia este concepto a una persona que viene de pa ses m s pobres que el nuestro

8338297 para el resto del mundo del f tbol el valencia es un gran club con amor propio y personalidad y no se dejar intimidar por nadie
8338298 se va de frente y con las cartas encima de la mesa y no se aceptar otra cosa
8338299 es un honor anunciar que el mejor delantero de europa seguir en el valencia adem s era una cosa a la que nos comprometimos y hemos cumplido porque elaboramos un proyecto s lido paso a paso con rigor y control
8338300 en nuestro valencia hacen falta hombres como david villa por su respeto y amor a los aficionados y por su compromiso con la entidad
8338301 est casado con el valencianismo y que nadie tanga dudas villa es de los nuestros
8338302 como hasta ahora defendiendo y respetando la camiseta que defiendes
8338303 gracias por tu comportamiento y los pr ximos a os har s del valencia todo lo que so amos
8338304 el esfuerzo que han hecho para que el jugador permanezca en la entidad
8338305 pueda tener alguna influencia en el despliegue de la ley
8338306 we may observe here that the liability of the members of unlawful assembly who knew that an offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of the object for which they had assembled is equal to those who commit it
8338307 it is a case where the members of one community were singled out and were murdered and their properties were burnt and looted such lawlessness deserved to be sternly dealt with
8338308 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8338309 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8338310 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8338311 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8338312 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8338313 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8338314 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8338315 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8338316 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8338317 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8338318 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8338319 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8338320 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8338321 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8338322 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8338323 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8338324 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8338325 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8338326 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8338327 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8338328 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8338329 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8338330 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8338331 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8338332 la vida sense una mica de verd s molt avorrida

8338348 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8338349 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8338350 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8338351 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8338352 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8338353 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8338354 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8338355 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8338356 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8338357 here rests in honored glory an american soldier known but to god
8338358 the overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem
8338359 a replica is not the same thing as the original
8338360 the cracks continue to grow and i cant predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument
8338361 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8338362 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8338363 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8338364 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8338365 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience
8338366 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8338367 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8338368 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8338369 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8338370 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8338371 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8338372 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8338373 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8338374 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8338375 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions

8338387 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8338388 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8338389 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
8338390 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
8338391 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
8338392 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8338393 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8338394 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8338395 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8338396 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8338397 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8338398 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8338399 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8338400 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8338401 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8338402 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8338403 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8338404 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8338405 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8338406 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8338407 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8338408 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8338409 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8338410 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8338411 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8338412 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8338413 on the road again republican convention 08 the final countdown road trip of destiny trip of a lifetime this time it counts road trip 08
8338414 you can pick it how you want to pick it
8338415 you can say were pressing or theyre pitching good you know what probably a little bit of both
8338416 theyre throwing the ball good against us and were fighting it a little bit trying to do too much that normally happens but youve just gotta work your way through these things
8338417 hopefully wednesdays a day where well come out relaxed a little bit and swing the bats a little better and have a better performance
8338418 albertas global reputation for nanotechnology research just became enhanced as we will now be recognized as a place for putting that technology on the store shelves and into peoples lives
8338419 this new centre the first of its kind in canada will give entrepreneurs a place to turn ideas into viable market ready products
8338420 the launch of acamp helps position western canada at the forefront of innovation and is an important milestone in albertas growing capacity for science and technology commercialization
8338421 in concordance with the canadas science and technology strategy mobilizing science and technology to canadas advantage our government is proud to contribute 3 5 million through its western diversification program to help alberta become a centre for nanotechnology development and production
8338422 its incredible the number of emerging technology companies in alberta with the potential to develop exciting new consumer products for world wide markets
8338423 alberta is a prime location for world class research and acamp can provide the means to turn research into viable products in fact we are already helping our clients produce marketable products to compete globally
8338424 acamp is the result of a collaborative effort between industry government and academia to create a platform for product development activities in the province
8338425 and we are very pleased to have obtained the services of ken brizel as the first ceo of acamp
8338426 nearly everyone wants a whole house audio system but without the expensive installation costs
8338427 by integrating the arkados powerline solutions directly into products installation and configuration can be done with very little labor and time for any existing home tatung and arkados address a great variety of mras components with many different functions and we believe the retrofit market offers stunning potential
8338428 tatungs design and manufacturing expertise and their speaker and lcd technologies allow us as a team to address a very broad range of products while leveraging our platform design approach
8338429 custom installers typically wire their systems into a new home as it is being built and right now housing starts are at a 17 year low so we believe the retrofit market offers a great opportunity for us
8338430 the companys decision to settle with midas now permanently resolves this matter and removes the cost and distraction of this litigation going forward gammon gold believes that the amount of the settlement is in the best interests of its shareholders in light of the cost and expense required to litigate in the united states gammon has and continues to deny any liability to midas
8338431 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8338432 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8338433 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8338434 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8338435 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training

8338441 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8338442 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event

8338520 the house of representatives passed a bill that would make sure what was done to me couldnt happen again but when it got to the senate enough republicans opposed it to prevent a vote
8338521 has promised to appoint supreme court justices who will enforce laws that protect everyday people like me
8338522 but this isnt a democratic or a republican issue its a fairness issue and fortunately there are some republicans and a lot of democrats who are on our side

8338540 i would just like to see him reiterate the amazing things hillary said last night and talk about unity
8338541 i always thought he was presidential i always thought he was an advocate of the little guy

8338544 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
8338545 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
8338546 if there was some other news to cover we wouldnt talk about disunity in the democratic party
8338547 the numbers tell a different story from the hype and theatre around the convention
8338548 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8338549 i dont know if theyre going to tell us anything or not
8338550 you might want to wait until we find out something for sure
8338551 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8338552 i think there are a few delegates who need to vote for hillary to reach that point of closure
8338553 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8338554 i still think as a tribute to senator clinton i would like to be able to say in the microphone following the directions of the great senator from new york hillary rodham clinton pennsylvania casts all its votes for barack obama
8338555 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8338556 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8338557 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8338558 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8338559 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8338560 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008

8338564 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8338565 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8338566 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8338567 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8338568 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8338569 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

8338575 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

8338585 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8338586 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8338587 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8338588 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8338589 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8338590 it shows a typical emerging market which is very volatile
8338591 offloading by foreign funds has been at the heart of the recent fall in pakistan equities
8338592 due to low volumes and uncertain political and economic conditions it selling by foreign funds creates a huge impact on share prices
8338593 but zardari and the ppp will face an increasingly skeptical public aggressive opposition from the pml n and popular demands for reform which they will be unwilling to meet
8338594 as a result political instability is likely particularly in the run up to the presidential elections

8338637 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8338638 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8338639 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

8338711 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president

8338720 you have to weigh the benefits of every project but saying no additional mitigation is feasible is like saying tough and i dont like that
8338721 i dont think theres anything to preclude doing the project

8338726 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8338727 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8338728 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8338729 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8338730 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8338731 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8338732 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8338733 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8338734 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8338735 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances

8338737 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8338738 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8338739 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8338740 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8338741 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8338742 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8338743 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8338744 hr teams need to understand how their industry will be affected and identify the skills needed this is a great opportunity to offer work placements and apprenticeships training young people now can help to build a skilled workforce for 2012 but her concern is that employers wont plan early enough
8338745 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8338746 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8338747 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8338748 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8338760 its possible that over time an energy tax by making some computers web sites blogs and perhaps cable tv channels too costly to maintain could reduce the supply of information if americans are finally giving up suvs because of high oil prices might we not eventually do the same with some information technologies that only seem to fragment our society not unite it a reduced supply of information technology might at least gradually cause us to gravitate toward community centered media such as local newspapers instead of the hyper individualistic outlets we have now

8338768 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8338769 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8338770 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8338771 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8338772 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8338773 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8338774 well they ought to do this they ought to do that

8338788 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8338789 climate eschatology really is the ultimate in big lie crisis politics the far left has failed so comprehensively to make the case for its vision of society and economy that the only thing left to do is to brazenly and repeatedly assert that the world will literally collapse unless we implement this otherwise indefensible vision
8338790 any minute now god gaia will bring the pain just you watch seriously like one more year
8338791 hes on vacation ive been told thats all im allowed to say hes on vacation

8338793 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8338794 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8338795 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8338796 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8338797 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8338798 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8338799 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8338800 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8338801 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8338802 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8338803 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8338804 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8338805 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8338806 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8338807 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8338808 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8338809 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8338810 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8338811 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8338812 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8338813 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8338814 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8338815 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8338816 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8338817 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8338818 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8338819 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8338820 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8338821 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8338822 who are open to doing something on the production side
8338823 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8338824 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8338825 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8338826 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8338827 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8338828 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8338829 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8338830 mommy doesnt like to go to your house because its not clean

8338833 respect and love begin with the self if we have none how can we give away any
8338834 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8338835 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8338836 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8338837 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8338838 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8338839 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8338840 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8338841 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8338842 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8338843 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8338844 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8338845 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8338846 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8338847 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8338848 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8338849 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8338850 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8338851 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8338852 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8338853 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8338854 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8338855 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8338856 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8338857 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8338866 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8338867 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8338868 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8338869 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8338870 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8338871 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8338872 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8338873 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8338874 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8338875 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8338876 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8338877 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8338878 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8338879 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8338880 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8338881 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8338882 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8338883 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism

8338890 if it came to scotland representing itself in the olympic games i would be very proud to do that
8338891 but there arent the facilities in my sport to sustain a national team
8338892 i believe before any calls are made for a scottish olympic team they need to address the lack of facilities to allow the scottish athletes to compete at the highest level
8338893 weve got the talent weve got these athletes weve got the passion we just need the opportunities and facilities to make it happen otherwise you would be banging your head against a brick wall
8338894 you wouldnt have the chance to compete with anyone if you didnt have 12 months of the year facilities
8338895 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can it is a possibility were very hopeful
8338896 he doesnt want to leave to join man city or everton
8338897 we are now discussing the next move to see what we do he is speaking with the manager at the moment but he is settled in london
8338898 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more
8338899 if it doesnt happen it wont be for want of trying

8338970 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8338971 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8338972 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8338973 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8338974 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8338975 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8338976 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8338977 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8338978 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8338979 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8338980 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8338981 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8338982 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8338983 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

8338985 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8338986 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8338987 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8338988 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8338989 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8338990 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8338991 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8338992 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8338993 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8338994 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8338995 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8338996 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8338997 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8338998 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8338999 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8339000 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8339001 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8339002 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

8339006 it was very emotional in the beginning and to see the whole stadium full of signs with her name on it sent a chill down my spine
8339007 she did everything she could do and she didnt leave a shred of doubt people who have doubts should just get over it
8339008 i was hoping to hear a speech to bring everyone together and deliver a home run but that was a grand slam
8339009 i was very cynical very cynical about whether she would really throw herself into supporting obama she did it 100 per cent

8339019 denise dominici put her romeoville tri level house on the market in april 2007 for 275 000 it hasnt sold and reducing the price has been painful for her even though shes moved into a new 425 000 custom built shorewood ranch in september shes turned down offers from renters reduced the price to 235 900 and offered to throw in the furnishings to her the house at its current price is a steal not a reflection of a bad market

8339021 in the past eight months the couple has looked at 25 condominiums theyd like to make an offer for their favorite a two bedroom unit in humboldt park but they think its worth 30 000 less than its listed and their real estate agent heard that higher offers have been rejected and the sellers may pull it from the market
8339022 were seeing a lot of people that bought within the last two years when money was cheap so to break even theyre maintaining a high listing price its only worth what im going to pay for it meyer said
8339023 sitting at an open house sunday for an elmhurst home first listed in february for 857 000 and now priced at 759 000 real estate agent sheila barbre saw six groups of people including two who stumbled upon the house after seeing a sign barbre had posted nearby at the illinois prairie path
8339024 martin paulson lake county chief assessment officer said despite the slowdown in the housing market most taxpayers will see an increase in their assessments thats because assessments in illinois townships are based on sales transactions that occurred during the three previous years 2005 2006 and 2007 when the housing market was stronger
8339025 many people do expect their assessments are going to go down said paulson
8339026 antioch township assessor heather kulfalk marotta said her office has received a number of calls from residents wondering why their assessments are going up when the housing market is in a slump she has to explain to them that assessments are based on an average of the three previous years not on current years sales activity

8339028 the squishy indianapolis area residential real estate market has come to this sluggish though it is the region hasnt been hit as hard as the nation as a whole sellers have the greatest advantage if their house is priced below 75 000 or if the house is in hendricks county buyers have the most leverage if the house is priced over 1 million or if the house is in morgan county

8339030 july sales plunged 21 percent to 9 502 units from july 2007 mibor reported the median sale price fell 3 percent to 124 500

8339032 broker jeff kucic said there isnt enough information yet to declare that the downturn is over
8339033 a little more than a year ago three major projects upscale condominiums at oneida landing rehabilitation of the vacant one river place building into a mixed use commercial and residential building and a new office and apartment complex headed up by the mcnamara development group were contemplated
8339034 now construction has begun on the mcnamara building but pat and jj condons oneida landing condo tower is shelved and their plans to work with the owner of one river place on a rehab project has stalled due to disagreement on the value of the property
8339035 the property the condons were going to build on is owned by area businessman jim sweet he said he was forced to terminate the condons option on the property because of the slow pace of pre sales
8339036 the project was very ambitious by quad city development standards it was billed as an 18 million eight story luxury condominium highrise with prices ranging from 214 000 on the second floor to 750 000 on the top floor
8339037 i held the property for two years at no cost to them and i felt they either needed to buy the property or pay a monthly stipend to keep it off the market he said
8339038 levee improvement commission member lucky lang said its unfortunate the projects are on hold but he remains optimistic about the long term prospects for that section of riverfront
8339039 davenport may not have been quite ready for what pat and jj proposed he said

8339045 mary hettinger of keller williams said she had seen a house for sale in northville with a classic car thrown into the deal but she said its not likely such gimmicks would have a big impact locally
8339046 the bottom line is its about the price said laura dykstra sales manager for the edward surovell realtors
8339047 buyers rarely select a home based on extras thrown into the deal she said but hey in this market people are willing to try just about anything
8339048 the numbers tell the story about new home construction in livingston county albeit a depressing one it should come as no surprise that new homes are trickling into a county that was once booming with new home construction several years ago subdivisions appeared to pop up almost overnight as rising home values and easy financing allowed people to move into a highly desirable community
8339049 home values are now falling banks arent lending so quickly and theres plenty of homes available with the increase in foreclosures

8339051 when he receives a call from someone asking whether to build rogers said hes faced with telling them a painful truth
8339052 if i can lie you want to build he usually begins telling them he then tells them the truth which is there are some great deals out there on foreclosures and other homes all it takes is some legwork on the part of the buyer
8339053 in all 12 midwestern cities tracked in the associated press re max monthly housing report sales fell by at least 10 percent from july last year the report analyzed home sales recorded by all real estate agents in those cities regardless of company affiliation
8339054 the median price fell in every city in the ap re max report except rapid city s d where it rose by 4 8 percent from a year ago to 179 000
8339055 the largest price drop by contrast was in detroit where the sinking economy and skyrocketing foreclosures helped push the median price down 36 percent to 81 000
8339056 bob mitchell an agent who works in detroit and its suburbs is currently listing a 6 100 square foot brick queen anne style home which needs major repairs for a mere 80 000

8339061 many wisconsin real estate agents dont expect much market improvement before 2009 in an online survey conducted last week for the association 84 4 percent said they expect fourth quarter sales to be the same or worse than the same period in 2007
8339062 if youve been waiting or hoping for things to get better stop he wrote
8339063 rochester realtor robin gwaltney agrees that prices are lower today than they were five years ago she says its because sellers are asking for closer to the actual value of their home
8339064 5 years ago sellers would ask for 10 to 20 percent more than what the home was worth
8339065 a foreclosed housing development will be going to the highest bidder the city of albert lea says the eagles rest development will be on the auction block in september larry thorstad has lived near the eagles rest golf course area in albert lea for 15 years
8339066 well with the golf course the way it was it was a beautiful area well used you know with the lake there and everything right now were kind of blocked from all of the eye sore that we see thorstad said
8339067 last december american bank bought back the property that was going to be turned into a housing development called eagles rest construction crews came in and started working on the project last year but neighbors say within a couple months all that work just came to a halt
8339068 even though its months past the foreclosure the developer has one year or until the end of this december to pay the mortgage off under his right of redemption

8339077 were seeing a lot of people that bought within the last two years when money was cheap so to break even theyre maintaining a high listing price
8339078 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8339079 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8339080 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8339081 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8339082 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8339083 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8339084 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8339085 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8339086 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8339087 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8339088 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8339089 i have been with united for nearly 40 years and i am proud of this company and what all of our people working together have accomplished
8339090 by seeking this preliminary injunction to stop unlawful work slowdowns we are standing up and refusing to let our customers and employees be used as bargaining chips by alpa in their campaign to exert financial pressure on this company to open their contract early

8339096 the addition of dr novello to our staff is a real coup for disney childrens hospital and the children of central florida and beyond
8339097 in addition the skill and expertise of renowned pediatric surgeons and the nicholson center for surgical advancement will help keep us on the leading edge of surgical technology
8339098 walt disney world resort is committed to the dreams of children in our community and were pleased to lend some of our magic to disney childrens hospital at florida hospital
8339099 this will be a special place that will enable children to use their imaginations in a unique immersive environment that will contribute to their overall health and healing
8339100 the partnership between florida hospital and disney demonstrates that central florida is quickly becoming known just as much for medicine and science as it is for its thriving tourism industry
8339101 we believe disney childrens hospital will provide the blueprint for other childrens hospitals in the future
8339102 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8339103 the anniversary of september 11 should be officially recognized as a national day of charitable service to honor the 9 11 victims volunteers and rescue and recovery workers of ground zero
8339104 all of us can best honor the memory of those lost by engaging in good deeds community service and other charitable acts to rekindle the remarkable spirit of unity that existed following the 9 11 tragedy

8339111 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8339112 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8339113 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8339114 the aicpa supports one set of high quality global accounting standards for public companies
8339115 we believe the capital markets ultimately will insist on ifrs for public companies todays action by the sec continues a robust and thoughtful debate that is critical as the transition occurs
8339116 a critical initial step is the development of a project plan that directs all components of the financial reporting system toward achieving the milestones laid out by the sec
8339117 the aicpa will work closely with the fasb the iasb and the international accounting standards committee foundation to help bring these milestones to fruition we are working with our members both preparers and auditors on ifrs to help them prepare for whats ahead
8339118 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8339119 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8339120 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8339121 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8339122 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8339123 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8339124 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8339125 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8339126 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8339127 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8339128 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8339129 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8339130 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8339131 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8339132 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8339133 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8339134 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8339135 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8339136 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8339137 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8339138 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8339139 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8339140 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8339141 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8339142 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8339143 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8339144 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8339145 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8339146 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8339147 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8339148 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8339149 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8339150 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8339151 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8339152 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8339153 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8339154 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8339155 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8339156 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8339157 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8339158 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8339159 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8339160 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8339161 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8339162 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8339163 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8339164 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8339165 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8339166 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8339167 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8339168 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8339169 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8339170 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8339171 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8339172 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8339173 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8339174 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8339175 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8339176 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8339177 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8339178 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8339195 if it came to scotland representing itself in the olympic games i would be very proud to do that
8339196 but there arent the facilities in my sport to sustain a national team
8339197 i believe before any calls are made for a scottish olympic team they need to address the lack of facilities to allow the scottish athletes to compete at the highest level
8339198 weve got the talent weve got these athletes weve got the passion we just need the opportunities and facilities to make it happen otherwise you would be banging your head against a brick wall
8339199 you wouldnt have the chance to compete with anyone if you didnt have 12 months of the year facilities
8339200 the abcd initiative inspired a notable degree of interagency cooperation and coordination in all four states
8339201 over the course of the three years interagency barriers were broken down and often intractable bureaucracies changed their behaviors as a result of abcd t he relationship between abcd and interagency cooperation went both ways it was necessary in many cases for interagency cooperation to occur in order to implement the abcd projects and abcd itself spurred interagency coordination
8339202 future public administration literature should continue to focus on questions of how government leaders overcome the many obstacles to collaboration
8339203 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8339204 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet

8339217 the classic spacewarp toy from the 80s has been recreated in japan and imported by thinkgeek for your rolling pleasure what is it that fascinates us about rolling steel balls on a roller coaster style track perhaps its the mesmerizing perpetual motion as the balls zoom around loops and curves only to be cranked corkscrew style up to the top for another go round or maybe its the hours of assembly time spent tweaking each section of track to get the perfect run without the balls flying across the room either way the spacewarp 5000s appeal is half geek based construction project and half satisfaction of watching your intricate marble coaster in action of course you can build the exact structure shown here or design your own crazy track with only the laws of physics as your limitation

8339259 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8339260 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8339261 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8339262 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8339263 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8339264 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8339265 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not

8339269 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream

8339271 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the

8339274 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908

8339276 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8339277 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8339278 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8339279 our stepped up enforcement is a matter of simple fairness
8339280 the motor fuel taxes being evaded pay for the very roads these trucks use honest truckers who pay the tax want to know we are pursuing those who do not
8339281 ill save you the trouble ive got dyed fuel in my truck
8339282 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8339283 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8339284 thus the brief period of stabilizing we picked up in may has given way to another major leg downward
8339285 in fact you have to go way back to the middle of the last recession august 2001 to find a changewave survey projecting this big of an it spending downturn
8339286 its a lot easier for customers to put off the purchases of servers some software and applications and even desktops than it is to put off storage purchases
8339287 once a company moves into the digital world information just piles up youve got to have some place to put it
8339288 the emergence of content rich business applications in areas such as telecommunications media entertainment and web 2 0
8339289 customers can really get great bang for their buck in buying new storage systems
8339290 people have increasingly been buying storage not just to store the data but also because they want to parse out components for analysis
8339291 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8339292 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8339293 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8339294 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8339295 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8339296 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8339297 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8339298 this long term orientation will keep us from selling in panic in a market downturn
8339299 apart from the lack of freedom of speech in singapore what do you think about the economy
8339300 many of us come here just to study and work this is not a place to live in its like an organisation not a country
8339301 you cannot distribute flyers here please stop now you have to ask the management for permission first
8339302 oh by the way how did you know that we were here
8339303 hi im chee soon juan from the singapore democratic party and you are
8339304 yes you need to write in if you want to do anything here
8339305 id be happy to do that is there a form that i can fill in
8339306 is there at least some guideline that tells me about the procedure how early should i write in advance how long does it take you to make the decision and who makes the decision it helps when things are a little more transparent
8339307 wait let me get this straight you say that i need to seek your permission to come to campus to distribute flyers but you dont have any procedural guidelines to help me along
8339308 this is the first time anyone has done this no one from a political party has come here before like this
8339309 quand cette question lui fut pos e harold wilson alors premier ministre de grande bretagne avait r pondu
8339310 willoughby and baltic founded in 2001 became home to dorkbotboston in january 2005 since then
8339311 raid z wouldnt require any special hardware it doesnt need nvram for correctness and it doesnt need write buffering for good performance with raid z zfs makes good on the original raid promise it provides fast reliable storage using cheap commodity disks
8339312 however whenever i unplug the sata cable from one of the drives to simulate a catastrophic drive failure while doing moderate reading from the zpool such as streaming hd video not only does the video hang on the remote machine which is accessing the zpool via nfs but the server running opensolaris seems to either hang or become incredibly unresponsive
8339313 never try this sort of thing thp gt with ide
8339314 its like saying lps or cds are bad its just a medium
8339315 a lot of us loved campaigning for her and its hard to watch it end but after something like this you have to have an emotional end for people to come to terms with things
8339316 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8339317 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8339318 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8339319 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8339320 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8339321 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8339322 it will be nice to close the book on them at least as far as presidential politics are concerned
8339323 vroiam s fiu acolo unde mi e locul n teren steaua este foarte motivat i cred c vom face diferen a nu cred c steaua se va ap ra iar dac vom marca primii ne vom califica

8339327 it stung me when i heard the news on the radio this morning
8339328 in november half our income comes from deer feed this is one more way for the state to screw us over
8339329 we are pleased that we are able to have an agreement with the elea before the school year starts
8339330 im glad we have one but i dont want to say anything about it until my members get the chance to see it
8339331 a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
8339332 leaving your race at the door leaving your people behind understand something boy youre not going to college to get educated youre going there to get trained
8339333 theyll tank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well trained well paid nigger but youre a nigger just the same
8339334 i could not then truthfully deny that this book which came out in 1968 as a greenleaf classic was mine
8339335 changed names and identities all incidents i have described have been taken from actual experiences
8339336 i have often wished i had two penises to enjoy simultaneously the double but different sensations of oral and genital copulation
8339337 im not one to go in for lolitas usually id rather not bed a babe under 20
8339338 but there are exceptions i didnt want to disappoint the trusting child at her still impressionistic age a rejection might be traumatic could even cripple her sexually for life
8339339 anne came up many times the next several weeks her aunt thinking she was in good hands actually she was
8339340 she obtained a course in practical sex from experienced and considerate practitioners rather than from ignorant insensitive neophytes i think we did her a favour although the pleasure was mutual
8339341 the number of white babes interested in at least one meeting with a negro male has been far more than i can handle
8339342 i regret none of my experiences or unusual appetites for me they are normal
8339343 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
8339344 this is an excellent start to the year for the nhs
8339345 a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients
8339346 my government has always been in favour of providing the best possible to its employees and it will also execute the sixth pay commission recommendations as early as possible

8339348 our feeing is if youve seen the damage thats occurred why dont you turn off the falls
8339349 theyre damaging the local environment and i dont think its worth it to have this question remain will the trees come back
8339350 when people come to a restaurant they have expectations of what they expect a reputation of 30 years in business to be
8339351 when they come and see the dead trees i think it just sends the wrong message
8339352 as soon as we saw that there was an issue we responded right away
8339353 were really concentrating on getting the salt off the trees off the leaves and out of the soil theyre basically getting a bath
8339354 but frankly i thought from the land side theyve been a big disappointment its prettier at night when the scaffolding disappears in the dark and the light picks up the water
8339355 its bothered me but i know theyre looking out for me and my best interests
8339356 i feel like i need the reps and the drills to make myself as good as possible so i always try to get in as much as possible

8339358 thor is committed to ensuring that whichever organization leases this property it will fully augment the historic revitalization occurring today in red hook thor is talking to numerous potential tenants for this site and no decision has yet been made about who we will partner with
8339359 red hook and brooklyn are open for business but while welcoming major retailers to our borough could bring economic vitality and much needed jobs to previously underserved and underutilized areas we must also be sure to grow smart and preserve a neighborhoods character
8339360 the city land review process will give the community and other stakeholders a chance to have their say on what is ultimately located at the site and what is best for the residents of red hook
8339361 the maintenance guys were not supposed to bury the trees i think they didnt understand the job
8339362 this falls into the shame on you category of things in the heights that rouse residents because were such a tree loving neighborhood
8339363 one tree was already dying before i called them and that was two weeks ago
8339364 we are concerned about the health of these trees from the concrete and will be sending a forestry crew to inspect them
8339365 it will be exactly the same the same menu and we still have all of the furniture
8339366 were going to redo the same interior the same decoration
8339367 if i can get them i would if not i will get replicas
8339368 its a great name and the key is having great food
8339369 joe has been in the restaurant business for a very long time and i think he can do a really good job and do justice to the name
8339370 it depends on when they were last painted or if they were rehabbed recently
8339371 if they need other extensive work theyre not going to paint over existing problems
8339372 we wont refuse a little paint on the walls to make it look nicer but it kind of feels like the community is getting the brush off
8339373 the r train is basically a joke its unreliable it runs as a shuttle at night there are other issues more important than peeling paint
8339374 annie wilson is the good kansas city girl whos coming over to west bev and its a big culture shock for her were going to go on this journey with annie and see how she makes the transition its going to be a bumpy road im sure with all the influences of her peers but shes got a good heart and a good head
8339375 i think he brings a little bit more elusiveness to the position being able to make some plays with his legs and was real solid through camp
8339376 we felt like maybe wed see what we could do with his playmaking ability
8339377 theyre a more mature group coming in theyre very focused theres a lot of similarity to previous tailback duos in terms of talent and the work ethic is good
8339378 he catches the ball extremely well hes very passionate about the game
8339379 theres probably going to be a broader rotation than weve ever had at receiver
8339380 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
8339381 this does look nice it might just be enough to get me to go back to firefox on my xubuntu computer opera runs so much faster on it but this looks to be too useful to pass up
8339382 we all need to be prepared and ready to respond from the citizen level and at every level of government
8339383 we are very pleased with the agreement and excited about the prospect of working with reliance on this landmark project we are confident that kg d6 is the first in a series of projects for agr in india we already have a strong presence in subsea operations in the asia pacific region and we will bring this expertise to support reliance on this project
8339384 we hope that this project will open the door for further contracts for agr where we will get the opportunity to offer our expertise through our wide range of services and products
8339385 new field projects and actions to increase oil and gas production are expected to add 600 000 barrels per day to statoilhydros production from the norwegian continental shelf ncs by 2015
8339386 standardised project solutions with a short lead time from discovery to first oil or gas are the key to future success on the ncs
8339387 our goal is to realise the short term resource and value potential of all of our producing fields while putting considerable efforts into developing new projects and business opportunities in order to sustain the production level on the ncs in the long term
8339388 enhanced recovery and extension of the life of fields and facilities on stream are critical to maximising the value of the petroleum resources on the ncs fields such as gullfaks oseberg grane sleipner west and tune will be key contributors towards our ambitions for improved oil recovery from existing fields we are thus currently maturing 600 million barrels of oil equivalent of new reserves the equivalent of a new norne field
8339389 the industrialisation of development solutions has already proved beneficial and we have implemented several small size field development projects in very short time this development must be progressed through a good partnership between us as the operator and our suppliers
8339390 effective drilling of new wells and optimal utilisation of the drilling capacity are also essential to the achievement of our goals for reserve development on the ncs finally long term access to prospective areas is a very important part of the foundation for our efforts and contribution to long term value capture

8339393 let us pray that the lord who made paul see the light and know his word and who touched the interior of pauls heart will also make us see the light so that our hearts may also be touched by his word and so that we may also give the world the light of the gospel and the truth of christ for which it thirsts
8339394 most models now show it is on a collision course for the gulf of mexicos productive regions with memories of hurricane katrina still fresh in most participants minds it is understandable that prices have broken sharply higher
8339395 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8339396 starting today were taking out nonessentials for most of the major oil companies
8339397 more and more of the tracks are all in agreement somewhere between houston and new orleans were going to have a problem thats the heart of the platforms and theyre still saying category 3 or higher
8339398 we see it close to galveston by monday or tuesday night
8339399 depending on the way it takes tomorrow they are going to make a decision whether to evacuate the platforms either friday or saturday
8339400 with all this padding wont it get pretty hot in there pretty fast
8339401 twente contacted us about verhaegh but we want to hold on to our important players
8339402 however we are willing to talk about the situation after the seasons opener against groningen
8339403 ive adapted a lot more now and im very excited and enthusiastic ill fight hard to play more
8339404 navas is a good player so well have to wait and see
8339405 but im going to fight to play more anyway this year will be easier than the last because the initial one is always tough
8339406 now ive adapted better i have the excitement needed to win
8339407 my intention is to stay in sevilla and prove that im a good player
8339408 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8339409 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8339410 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8339411 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8339412 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8339413 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8339414 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8339415 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8339416 its true that heerenveen contacted us about the availability of kenny
8339417 a first conversation will take place on wednesday but i have no idea how serious heerenveen are and if theyre willing to meet our demands
8339418 certamente como as escolas s o importantes centros de debates principalmente com o fim das elei es diretas devem estar sendo centro de disputas eleitorais

8339437 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8339438 it is very very weird we have not heard anything we dont know whether they were in there or not
8339439 nobody knows until we can get access to the building

8339450 where soil phosphorous levels are low 10 20 parts per million mehlich iii or bray 1 p or very low less than 10 ppm the likelihood of a wheat yield response to phosphorous is greater than 50 percent
8339451 often the yield response is great enough to more than pay for the phosphorous fertilizer even at today s prices
8339452 early season phosphorous deficiency can limit wheat yield potential the first five to six weeks after emergence is the critical period wheat absorbs about 18 percent of its total seasonal phosphorus uptake in just the first two weeks of growth
8339453 it doesn t take much added phosphorous fertilizer with the proper timing and placement to have a big effect on early season development and yields
8339454 hello my baby hello my darling hello my ragtime galllll
8339455 for years dick durbin has sat by and done nothing as his dysfunctional democratic colleagues have turned the state capitol into a three ring circus
8339456 now durbin speaks up in denver and says his buddies owe it to obama to pull it together wrong senator durbin your dysfunctional democratic colleagues owe it to the people of illinois to come together and work for real solutions to the challenges this state faces
8339457 where has dick durbin been while his democratic colleagues in springfield have put petty political feuds above the best interests of the people they are supposed to represent
8339458 the democratic legislature and the democratic governor have been unable to do the basic job of governing by passing and signing a capital bill this failure is inexcusable and dick durbin the senior democratic senator from illinois has been unwilling to show any leadership to end this impasse
8339459 as usual its all about whats in durbins best interest
8339460 god forbid his dysfunctional democratic colleagues in springfield embarrass him on the national stage
8339461 the voters of illinois deserve a senator who will fight for them who is willing to do the hard work of governing and who has the political courage to demonstrate real leadership
8339462 he did it he tried to kill him he wasnt successful
8339463 there but for the grace of god is a murderer
8339464 you know that a crime was committed the question is who committed the crime
8339465 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8339466 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8339467 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8339468 we are very pleased with our growth in the south and west of the country
8339469 our phoenix office continues its growth and is exceeding our expectations for client service and new opportunities we have learned that many companies do business in both these markets making this move a natural extension of our goal to increase service to our clients
8339470 all i hear now is how many numbers of protestors do you have glenn
8339471 you have guys looking like robo cops coming in with all this gear on and its very intimidating
8339472 both the protest organizers and the police over the course of this entire year have been overreacting to each other
8339473 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign
8339474 i still firmly believe there is a tremendous amount of untapped resources that can be tapped if the obama campaign pro actively engages people in the clinton world
8339475 we have been doing business with russia for over 30 years and further development of our innovative solutions will ensure that we maintain our position as the dominant partner in the field of offshore oil transfer for russian oil companies and ship owners

8339477 she could not have done a better job of putting it all together for people to feel really unified and to create the excitement of what were going to do
8339478 i was very proud i very happy because i think she silenced a lot of critics last night and a lot of doubters who are always questioning her motives
8339479 and she made the case for all the right reasons to support obama
8339480 im a big supporter of hillary im also a supporter of obama i have multiple identities
8339481 i still believe that hillary is completely ready to lead this country in many ways
8339482 sei la luce che illumina le mie notti buie irradi la mia vita di essa sei una stella che brilla di luce propria e ne ragala agli altri ed il mio primo pensiero al mattino e lultimo alla sera
8339483 it was a good game but it wouldve been a lot better if it was a good game
8339484 it was a good game but it wouldve been a lot better if it was a good game

8339488 in march i taught myself php and im pretty sure theres a few basic ideas of web programming that are worth sharing
8339489 the cost of making a game is so high that you need to recover it by selling a lot more units
8339490 you cant give up half the market by selling exclusives
8339491 its a trend were excited about but not completely surprised about if you look at the installed base and attached rate of customers to the xbox
8339492 third party publishers are looking at the same things we are and they want to put games into as many peoples hands as possible
8339493 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8339494 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were
8339495 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system
8339496 people were buying the xbox in anticipation of halo 3
8339497 relationships with console manufacturers is important to all third party publishers

8339501 la nuez de nuestra propuesta es que el gobierno declare canceladas permanentemente las concesiones mineras o que el parlamento las derogue se delimiten las tierras de los ind genas con participaci n de sus comunidades y sus aliados y se compren las fincas a que haya lugar para que puedan vivir en paz
8339502 entre los ganaderos y los yukpa el gobierno revolucionario opta por los ind genas
8339503 y si es necesario pues les compramos las bienhechur as mejoras de infraestructura a los ganaderos
8339504 no estamos invadiendo haciendas de los ganaderos sino recuperando tierras que fueron de nuestros abuelos bajamos para trabajar en la tierra plana y que los ni os no se mueran en la monta a
8339505 el deber de los militares es cuidarnos pues nosotros lo que queremos son nuestras tierras para vivir en paz

8339511 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8339512 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8339513 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8339514 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8339515 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8339516 consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8339517 both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8339518 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8339519 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8339520 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8339521 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8339522 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8339523 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8339524 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8339525 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8339526 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8339527 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8339528 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8339529 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8339530 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8339531 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8339532 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8339533 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8339534 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8339556 regulations that implement proposition 103s mandate that insurance rates reflect a drivers mileage will lower auto insurance premiums particularly when the high cost of gasoline is encouraging people to drive less
8339557 they will also give consumers a financial incentive to carpool and promote mass transit and other transportation technologies that can reduce the impact of driving on our environment and our costly reliance on oil assembly member jared huffmans attention to this important issue along with other organizations led to todays announcement we also applaud commissioner poizners prompt action in drafting the proposed regulations
8339558 lawmakers and regulators have stepped up to the plate to help californians green their insurance policies and save people money
8339559 now insurance companies must do their part by giving drivers real savings when they drive less

8339569 joe nathans generosity and leadership in making this wonderful gift underscores the importance of the spirit of philanthropy that is growing among our alumni
8339570 as much as joe was a talented collegiate athlete and a high achiever as a student more importantly he is a remarkable human being we are very proud of joe and are thrilled to name our baseball field in his honor it will serve as a lasting tribute to his continued love for his experience as a stony brook student athlete
8339571 joes support of our baseball program is greatly appreciated he embodies all the core values we try to instill in our student athletes commitment passion pride respect and swagger current and future stony brook baseball student athletes will benefit from playing in a facility which joes gift will help build future stony brook recruits will be able to look forward to playing in one of the finest facilities in the northeast
8339572 finding success as a major ball player has been terrific
8339573 i have met so many wonderful fans during my college years on long island minor league days down south my time in san francisco and of course in minnesota the foundation gives my fans a chance to share in my success and for all of us to give back to our communities
8339574 congratulations to joe nathan on his great successes while at stony brook as a student athlete and as an all star pitcher for the minnesota twins
8339575 his decision to share those successes with his alma mater and for the university to name the field in his honor is a cherished opportunity i congratulate president shirley strumkenny director of athletics jim fiore and head coach matt senk for sharing in this vision with joe and helping to create a great opportunity for current and future baseball student athletes at stony brook

8339587 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8339588 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8339589 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8339590 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8339591 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8339592 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8339593 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8339594 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8339595 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8339596 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8339597 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8339598 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8339599 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8339600 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8339601 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8339654 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8339655 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8339656 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8339657 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8339658 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8339659 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8339660 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8339661 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8339662 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8339663 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8339664 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8339665 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8339666 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8339667 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8339668 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8339669 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8339670 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8339683 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8339684 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8339686 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

8339718 what i would change obviously and what you have to be aware of is the final campaign is very different from the primary
8339719 you think youve addressed every issue under the sun you try to do so in your acceptance speech but its a whole new ballgame and youve got to begin post convention as if the campaign has just begun
8339720 i just kind of assumed look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would
8339721 and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
8339722 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened

8339727 a number like 32 minutes average viewing time suggests that these past two weeks may ultimately be looked back on as the moment when the lines between the tv and web viewing experience began to disappear
8339728 for us we showcased the broad global power and reach of video as well as the strength of our fourth generation platform
8339729 our vision will be done with the utmost respect with a continuity to zombies work but also a real evolution of the world he set in place
8339730 excuse me mam would you please stop blocking the road way no pretty please
8339731 take a look around at the cities and the towns
8339732 by screaming at bullying injuring maming libeling and yes even murdering the opposition with the tacit approval of bushco you have become the brown shirts of today
8339733 officer absolutely no reason to be violent more likely hes just an intolerant fan of bushs illegal war like you 2 hr 13 min ago 13 7 f codepink theyre sick liberals who protest the marines and try to get them kicked out of berkely
8339734 hes in a high stress situation he made a poor choice and she antagonized him

8339744 our focus was clearly there even though we didnt quite see it in game one
8339745 they set some lofty goals for this year and we are creeping towards that goal but we are not quite where we want to be
8339746 i am not quite sure what happened in game one and the first half of game two
8339747 i dont know if they were still thinking about last year
8339748 we started putting the ball outside a little more and spotted our serves
8339749 it is going to kill us if we dont learn to communicate
8339750 a couple players stepped up that i didnt think would step up they took initiative and i was proud of that
8339751 she is one of our best offensive players and i expect it from her
8339752 we have a game on thursday thats our focus one game at a time forget it if its a win or a loss
8339753 if there was a clear cut starter it would be a lot easier to take leadership of the team
8339754 vic coached at troy and has friends in the state i have friend in the state have never had a problem with either school and a guy makes an off the cuff comment and i know were really looking for things to write about talk about on the internet and talk shows
8339755 i promise you koenning had better not come back on this campus weve got one person at the high school who has an escalade and thats the choir director whos been working in the school system for 40 years
8339756 he was my only child my linage is stopped right now
8339757 violence makes me sad and angry every weekend there are shootings where i live you cant go out to buy milk
8339758 he will be released from the hospital today or tomorrow we thank god hes alive

8339760 no nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the united states
8339761 the policies of our country comply with our law which prohibits torture were proud of our country and what it stands for we expect all who serve america to conduct themselves with honor and we enforce the rules
8339762 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty
8339763 someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep spirits up
8339764 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
8339765 the cameras didnt change our behaviour at all except simon had to wear his pyjamas
8339766 we came to respect what the programme makers wanted to do show that behind the closed door aspect of family life how things are resolved the love thats there in that family life
8339767 also its a fantastic thing to pass on to later generations of the hughes
8339768 we were not trying to find a family that symbolises britain because no family can do that
8339769 but we didnt want to find the partridge family the extremes because theres enough drama conflict resolution without that

8339778 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8339779 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8339780 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8339781 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8339782 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8339783 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8339784 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8339785 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8339786 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers
8339787 obama got this far because many voters projected onto him that he could be the leader of an american renewal they know we need nation building at home now not in iraq not in afghanistan not in georgia but in america obama cannot lose that theme
8339788 we need to be doing more for troops and their families
8339789 troops have to know that were making the same commitment to our country that theyve made
8339790 what we need from our leader is to show us as a nation how to love our troops

8339803 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8339804 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8339805 we recognize there needs to be a balance between imports and domestic production in russia
8339806 the case sparked renewed calls in may for the state to outlaw bestiality though lawmakers failed to support a bill this year
8339807 all those in favor of the bill making it against the law for humans to have sex with animals
8339808 wait a minute wait a minute what kind of animals
8339809 wait a minute wait a minute does that include oral sex
8339810 yes yes legislator jackoff it does now can we get on with

8339816 the story of christianity is handed down to us in the language of archetype and myth that doesnt say anything negative about the story or the history behind it that kind of story language is understandable to people from every age and from every social and economic level i mean the gospels are a beautiful collection of stories that will break your heart if you let them its gorgeous its and yet somehow being a minister began to feel false to me you cant get paid for being spiritual without that damaging you somehow i dont think you can anyway maybe it was just me but i got to where i couldnt tell the difference between myself and the role you know
8339817 i dont know what it would be like to lose yourself in that role of course but i know as a woman what its like to have a pretty heavy role laid on you and a lot of expectations and those expectations are good things that you want to be or do but also things that you could lose yourself in so yeah i think i understand

8339868 first of all let me just say that this money exchange is terrible for the people of california
8339869 but it is good for proposition 11 because it proves once again how important it is to change the system and how important it is to take government back and make the people have ownership of government rather than the politicians in sacramento
8339870 house republicans are offering an all of the above strategy to lower gasoline prices by increasing production of american energy promoting more conservation and efficiency and encouraging the use of more alternative and renewable fuels the american people support our plan and they have every right to demand that speaker pelosi allow a vote on our energy reforms they deserve more than yet another democratic scheme that will do nothing to lower gasoline prices or reduce home heating costs house republicans unprecedented nationwide gas prices protest entered its fourth full week yesterday and we will not relent until we secure a vote on our all of the above energy reforms on behalf of working families and small businesses who need our help
8339871 clearly denvers rarefied air has gone straight to democrat leaders heads for thinking that their new energy plan is anything more than a rehash of the broken promises and failed policies of the past
8339872 here we are exactly 600 days removed from the beginning of this congress and only now are democrat leaders getting around to proposing a so called comprehensive plan for energy independence
8339873 moreover democrats have demonstrated their glaring lack of credibility on this issue in ironic fashion by proposing an energy plan in the very same city where for months they had been getting their gas tax free while coloradans were scrimping and saving to pay their fair share
8339874 the democrat energy plan is to drive small cars and wait for the wind well this reminds me of the people of france who were starving and the queen was told that the people had no bread and her response was to say let them eat cake
8339875 i found a camera 2 months ago which i handed in to the police its not been claimed so theyve now given it to me its a nice camera and i certainly dont mind keeping it but i as the photos include a stag night and then some european travel i thought they might be somebodies honeymoon photos
8339876 is it ok if i pass a photo onto some friends i was brought up in aberdeen and by the looks of it they live in the west end of aberdeen a bit older than me but perhaps someones older brother or sister might know
8339877 like sharkey i recognised the rubislaw quarry and on friday drove past it to confirm drove around for a wee while just on the off chance and at one time was only one street away from forest ave thats just like the thing
8339878 i was out all day and drove down the street in number 008
8339879 success thanks everyone i have now spoken to the owner of the camera despite constant teasing from family which made me more determined the camera and contents is to be reunited with its owner
8339880 hello everyone im the guy who lost the camera irenicdonna your efforts are truly amazing i dont know if there are many or enough people in the world who would do what youve done i cant thank you enough my wife and i do indeed live in aberdeen with our wee dog moe the pictures are from trips to rome and brussels my little sisters wedding and lastly a hillwalking trip with friends through the highlands isle of skye and glencoe we didnt know the camera was lost until it was too late to retrace our steps

8339882 wilkinson established a firearms factory in a small suburb of reading that was able to meet the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8339883 these are attractive items for those connected to organised criminal networks if you have one of these readily available you will be targeted by other criminals who want to take it off you
8339884 one of the integral problems with these weapons is they do not necessarily hit your intended target they also have difficulty stopping and starting them they go off and they are difficult to keep in single fire
8339885 we can see very clearly the devastating impact of this heinous crime particularly and disproportionately although not exclusively on black communities
8339886 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8339887 telos has managed to do something that few others have accomplished both an openness to truth and a willingness to take a hard look at what is thought about it
8339888 telos maintains a truly global perspective and a universal range of sympathies it is one of the very few remaining morally uncensored forums for open political discussion one suspects that in these dark times its best days are yet to come
8339889 telos remains provocative and independent in a time of intellectual banality
8339890 telos is an intellectually provocative quarterly that dares to present unpopular views and truths

8339894 the idea of reprogramming one differentiated cell type into another of an adult tissue is very exciting and it is applicable to achieve the regeneration of different types of cells in the body
